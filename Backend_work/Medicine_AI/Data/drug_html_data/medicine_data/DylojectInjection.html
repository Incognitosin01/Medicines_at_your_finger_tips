Do not exceed 150 mg total daily dose.</p><p>For the treatment of acute pain, the recommended dose of DYLOJECT is 37.5 mg administered by intravenous bolus injection over 15 seconds every 6 hours as needed, Maximum daily dose is 150 mg.</p><p>To reduce the risk of renal adverse reactions, patients must be well hydrated prior to administration of DYLOJECT.</p><p>Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If visibly opaque particles, discoloration or other foreign particles are observed, the solution should not be used.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">DYLOJECT (diclofenac) Injection: 37.5 mg/mL in a single-dose glass vial. DYLOJECT is a clear, colorless, aqueous, nonpyrogenic sterile solution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">DYLOJECT is contraindicated in the following patients:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Avoid the use of</span> DYLOJECT <span class="following_xmChange">in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If</span> DYLOJECT <span class="following_xmChange">is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</span></p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. DYLOJECT is administered by intravenous injection and is intended for acute short term use. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated Patients:</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials of oral diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).</p><p>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2-6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3-8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</p><p>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p><p>Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</p><p>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female sex, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.</p><p>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. DYLOJECT is not indicated for long-term treatment. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p><p>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), DYLOJECT should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue DYLOJECT immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver-related event in patients treated with diclofenac, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing DYLOJECT with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, anti-epileptics).</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including DYLOJECT, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.</p><p>Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>5.5 Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Avoid the use of DYLOJECT in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If DYLOJECT is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</span></p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>DYLOJECT is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency and is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency in the perioperative period and who are at risk for volume depletion. Acute renal decompensation was observed in 4% out of 68 patients enrolled with renal impairment and treated with DYLOJECT in clinical trials in the perioperative period.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating DYLOJECT. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of DYLOJECT [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span> Avoid the use of DYLOJECT in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If DYLOJECT is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, DYLOJECT is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>]. When DYLOJECT is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of DYLOJECT at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. DYLOJECT is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including DYLOJECT, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with DYLOJECT has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including DYLOJECT, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of DYLOJECT in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and chemistry profile periodically [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)</span>]. DYLOJECT is not indicated for long-term treatment.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>During clinical development, 1,156 patients were exposed to DYLOJECT in multiple-dose, controlled and open-label studies. DYLOJECT was administered post-surgically every 6 hours for up to 5 days. The incidence rates of adverse reactions listed in the following table are derived from multicenter, controlled clinical studies in post-operative patients comparing DYLOJECT to placebo in patients who may have also received morphine rescue medication.</p><p class="First"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">MedDRA Preferred Term</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Placebo</span><span class="Italics">*</span></span></p><p><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">N=126</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DYLOJECT<span class="Italics">*</span></span></p><p><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">N=187</span></span></p><p class="First">Any Reaction</p><p class="First">104 (83%)</p><p class="First">146 (78%)</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p>Constipation</p><p>Headache</p><p>Infusion Site Pain</p><p>Dizziness</p><p>Flatulence</p><p>Vomiting</p><p>Insomnia</p><p>Pruritus</p><p>Hypotension</p><p>Pyrexia</p><p>Anemia</p><p>Infusion Site Extravasation</p><p class="First">50 (40%)</p><p>14 (11%)</p><p>20 (16%)</p><p>10 (8%)</p><p>2 (2%)</p><p>20 (16%)</p><p>23 (18%)</p><p>12 (10%)</p><p>10 (8%)</p><p>6 (5%)</p><p>13 (10%)</p><p>9 (7%)</p><p>1 (1%)</p><p class="First">45 (24%)</p><p>25 (13%)</p><p>19 (10%)</p><p>19 (10%)</p><p>15 (8%)</p><p>15 (8%)</p><p>12 (6%)</p><p>11 (6%)</p><p>9 (5%)</p><p>9 (5%)</p><p>8 (4%)</p><p>8 (4%)</p><p>6 (3%)</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Adverse reactions of special interest</span></span></p><p>Based on the analysis of the pooled data from the multi-dose, controlled clinical trials, post-operative patients treated with DYLOJECT had more adverse reactions related to wound healing (7.5%) compared to patients treated with placebo (4%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Adverse reactions from clinical studies or spontaneous reports for other formulations of diclofenac and other NSAIDs</span></span></p><p>In patients taking diclofenac or other NSAIDs, the most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1%-10% of patients are:</p><p>Gastrointestinal experiences including abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, nausea, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal) and vomiting.<br/>

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including DYLOJECT, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of DYLOJECT in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, and rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 0.7, 0.7, and 1.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of DYLOJECT despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses [<span class="Italics">see Data</span>].

Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including DYLOJECT, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of DYLOJECT has not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)</span>].</p><p>Diclofenac metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of DYLOJECT are similar in elderly compared to young adults [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Orally administered diclofenac sodium is extensively metabolized.

Dosing adjustments in patients with mild hepatic impairment is not necessary. The pharmacokinetics of DYLOJECT were not studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and use in this population is not recommended.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetics of DYLOJECT in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment is similar compared to healthy subjects. However, acute renal decompensation was observed in 4% out of 68 patients enrolled with renal impairment and treated with DYLOJECT in clinical trials in the perioperative period.

Each mL of aqueous solution contains 37.5 mg of diclofenac sodium (34.8 mg of diclofenac).</p><p>Diclofenac sodium is a phenylacetic acid derivative that is a white to off-white, virtually odorless, crystalline powder. Diclofenac sodium is freely soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and in dilute acid. Diclofenac sodium is sparingly soluble in water. Its chemical formula and name are: C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span>Na [M.W. = 318.14] 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl) amino] benzeneacetic acid, monosodium salt.</p><p>DYLOJECT is a clear colorless sterile solution. The inactive ingredients of DYLOJECT include: 333 mg hydroxypropyl betadex (HPβCD), 5 mg monothioglycerol, sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment, and water for injection.</p><h2>Dyloject Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of DYLOJECT, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The effect of DYLOJECT on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive (moxifloxacin 400 mg) - and placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy subjects. A total of 70 subjects was administered diclofenac sodium 37.5 mg and 75 mg. In a study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on Fridericia correction method (QTcF) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following intravenous administration of DYLOJECT to healthy volunteers, plasma concentrations of diclofenac exceed that of immediate-release oral diclofenac for the first 45 minutes reaching a maximum of 4.8-fold 5 minutes after administration.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac following intravenous administration of DYLOJECT and oral doses of immediate-release diclofenac are compared in Table 3.</p><p class="First"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">Parameter<span class="Sup">1</span></span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DYLOJECT</span></p><p><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">37.5 mg</span></span></p><p><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">IV</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">Oral IR Diclofenac</span></span></p><p><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">50 mg</span></span></p><p><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">PO</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">Single Dose</span></span></p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span> (ng/mL)</p><p>T<span class="Sub">max</span> (h)</p><p>AUC<span class="Sub">(inf)</span> (h∙ng/mL)</p><p>t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> (h)</p><p>CL (mL/min)</p><p>V<span class="Sub">z</span> (L)</p><p class="First">6,031 ± 1,178</p><p>0.083</p><p>1,859 ± 376</p><p>1.44 ± 0.27</p><p>324 ± 63.0</p><p>40.1 ± 9.77</p><p class="First">1,246 ±732</p><p>1.5</p><p>1,562 ± 519</p><p>1.28 ± 0.27</p><p>526 ± 179</p><p>57.3 ± 20.4</p><p class="First"><span class="Emphasis"><span class="Bold">Multiple Dose</span></span></p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span> (ng/mL)</p><p>T<span class="Sub">max</span> (h)</p><p>AUC<span class="Sub">(0-t)</span> (h∙ng/mL)</p><p>t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> (h)</p><p>CL (mL/min)</p><p>V<span class="Sub">z</span> (L)</p><p class="First">5,617 ± 1,799</p><p>0.083</p><p>1,839 ± 506</p><p>2.29 ± 0.63</p><p>387 ± 394</p><p>83.4 ± 127</p><p class="First">851 ± 462</p><p>1.49</p><p>1,350 ± 601</p><p>2.80 ± 0.66</p><p>894 ± 1,392</p><p>242 ± 486</p><p>DYLOJECT administered as an intravenous bolus dose of 37.5 mg every 6 hours for 4 doses to healthy subjects (N=36) showed minimal accumulation with mean values for C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC equivalent between the first and the fourth dose.</p><p>DYLOJECT exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over intravenous doses ranging from 18.75 to 75 mg and injection times ranging from a bolus (less than 5 seconds) to 60 seconds.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Following administration of DYLOJECT, the apparent volume of distribution during the terminal elimination phase (V<span class="Sub">z</span>) of diclofenac is 40.1 ± 9.77 L.</p><p>Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily albumin.

The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy- diclofenac.</p><p>In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy- and 5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of DYLOJECT decline from peak levels in a biexponential fashion, with a terminal phase half-life of approximately 1.4 hours following intravenous administration.</p><p>Total systemic clearance of diclofenac in plasma following administration of DYLOJECT is 324 ± 63 mL/min.</p><p>Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine following administration of DYLOJECT.
