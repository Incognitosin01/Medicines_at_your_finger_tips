Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed. Never use Subutex in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed.</p><p>Subutex sublingual is usually taken for only at the start of treatment for addiction. Most people are later switched to another medicine that contains this medicine (Bunavail, Sublocade, Suboxone, Zubsolv).</p><p>You may receive your first doses of buprenorphine sublingual in a hospital or clinic setting until your condition improves.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.</p><p>Use dry hands when handling the tablet. Place the tablet under your tongue and allow it to dissolve with your mouth closed. Do not chew the tablet or swallow it whole.</p><p>If your doctor has prescribed more than 2 tablets per dose, place the correct number of tablets under your tongue at the same time and allow them to dissolve completely.</p><p>Do not eat or drink anything until the tablet or film has completely dissolved in your mouth.</p><p>You may need frequent blood tests to check your liver function.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using Subutex.</p><p>Never crush or break a Subutex pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. Doing so could result in death.</p><p><b>Any medical care provider who treats you should know that you are being treated for opioid addiction, and that you are taking Subutex sublingual.</b> Make sure your family members know how to provide this information in case they need to speak for you during an emergency.</p><p>Do not stop using Subutex suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using  Subutex.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of your medicine. Subutex is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush the unused medicine down the toilet.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A  Subutex overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness or weakness, cold or clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, slow heart rate, weak pulse, very slow breathing, or coma.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking buprenorphine sublingual?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how  Subutex will affect you.
