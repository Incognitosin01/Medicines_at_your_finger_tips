</ul><h2>Methylphenidate Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution is a mild central nervous system (CNS) stimulant available as 5 mg/5 mL and 10 mg/5 mL oral solutions for oral administration. Methylphenidate hydrochloride is methyl α-phenyl-2-piperidineacetate hydrochloride, and its structural formula is</p><p></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride, USP is a white to off white, odorless, fine crystalline powder. Its solutions are acid to litmus. It is freely soluble in water and in methanol, soluble in alcohol, and slightly soluble in chloroform and in acetone.</p><p>Each mL of methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution 5 mg/5 mL contains 1 mg of methylphenidate hydrochloride, USP.</p><p>Each mL of methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution 10 mg/5 mL contains 2 mg of methylphenidate hydrochloride, USP.</p><p>In addition, methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution also contains the following inactive ingredients: diluted hydrochloric acid, glycerin, polyethylene glycol, grape flavor and purified water.</p><h2>Methylphenidate Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomers. The <span class="Italics">d-threo </span>enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomer.</p><p>Methylphenidate HCl is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.</p><p>The mode of therapeutic action in humans is not completely understood, but methylphenidate presumably activates the brain stem arousal system and cortex to produce its stimulant effect. Methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p><p>There is neither specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism whereby methylphenidate hydrochloride produces its mental and behavioral effects in children, nor conclusive evidence regarding how these effects relate to the condition of the central nervous system.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution is readily absorbed. Following oral administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution, peak plasma methylphenidate concentrations are achieved at 1 to 2 hours. Methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution has been shown to be bioequivalent to Ritalin<span class="Sup">®</span> tablet. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> following a 20 mg dose is approximately 9 ng/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Food Effect</span></p><p>In a study in adult volunteers to investigate the effects of a high-fat meal on the bioavailability of methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution at a dose of 20 mg, the presence of food delayed the peak by approximately 1 hour (1.7 hours, fasted and 2.7 hours, fed). Overall, a high-fat meal increased the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution by about 13% and the AUC by about 25%, on average. Through a cross-study comparison, the magnitude of increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC is found to be comparable between the methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution and Ritalin, the immediate release tablet.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily via deesterification to alpha-phenylpiperidine acetic acid (PPA, ritalinic acid). The metabolite has little or no pharmacologic activity.</p><p>After oral dosing of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite was PPA, accounting for approximately 80% of the dose.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of the methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution have been studied in healthy adult volunteers. The mean terminal half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of methylphenidate following administration of 20 mg methylphenidate hydrochloride (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> = 2.7 hours) is comparable to the mean terminal t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> following administration of Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride immediate-release tablets) (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> = 2.8h) in healthy adult volunteers.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Gender</span> – The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution administration has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race</span> – The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution administration has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Age</span> – The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution administration have not been studied in pediatrics.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Insufficiency</span></p><p>There is no experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution in patients with renal insufficiency. After oral administration of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, methylphenidate was extensively metabolized and approximately 80% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in the form of ritalinic acid. Since renal clearance is not an important route of methylphenidate clearance, renal insufficiency is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></p><p>There is no experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution in patients with hepatic insufficiency.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Methylphenidate Oral Solution</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Attention Deficit Disorders, Narcolepsy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Attention Deficit Disorders</span> (previously known as Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children). Other terms being used to describe the behavioral syndrome below include: Hyperkinetic Child Syndrome, Minimal Brain Damage, Minimal Cerebral Dysfunction, Minor Cerebral Dysfunction.</p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program which typically includes other remedial measures (psychological, educational, social) for a stabilizing effect in children with a behavioral syndrome characterized by the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. The diagnosis of this syndrome should not be made with finality when these symptoms are only of comparatively recent origin. Nonlocalizing (soft) neurological signs, learning disability, and abnormal EEG may or may not be present, and a diagnosis of central nervous system dysfunction may or may not be warranted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Diagnostic Considerations</span></p><p>Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but of special psychological, educational, and social resources.</p><p>Characteristics commonly reported include: chronic history of short attention span, distractibility, emotional lability, impulsivity, and moderate-to-severe hyperactivity; minor neurological signs and abnormal EEG. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the child and not solely on the presence of one or more of these characteristics.</p><p>Drug treatment is not indicated for all children with this syndrome. Stimulants are not intended for use in the child who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or primary psychiatric disorders, including psychosis. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is generally necessary. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe stimulant medication will depend upon the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child's symptoms.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Marked anxiety, tension, and agitation are contraindications to methylphenidate hydrochloride, since the drug may aggravate these symptoms. Methylphenidate hydrochloride is contraindicated also in patients known to be hypersensitive to the drug, in patients with glaucoma, and in patients with motor tics or with a family history or diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome.</p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride is contraindicated during treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and also within a minimum of 14 days following discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (hypertensive crises may result).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serious Cardiovascular Events</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Sudden Death and Pre-Existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart </span><span class="Bold">Problems</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Children and Adolescents</span> – Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span> – Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions</span></p><p>Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2 to 4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3 to 6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g., those with pre-existing hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Stimulant Medications</span></p><p>Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Adverse Events</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pre-Existing Psychosis –</span> Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.</p><p><span class="Bold">Bipolar Illness –</span> Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in such patients. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms –</span> Treatment emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by stimulants at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.1% (4 patients with events out of 3482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usual doses) of stimulant-treated patients compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Aggression –</span> Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility.</p><p><span class="Bold">Seizures</span></p><p>There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued.</p><p><span class="Bold">Priapism</span></p><p>Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or discontinuation): Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.</p><p><span class="Bold">Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud’s Phenomenon</span></p><p>Stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Long-Term Suppression of Growth</span></p><p>Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.</p><p>Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Visual Disturbance</span></p><p>Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">USE IN CHILDREN LESS THAN SIX YEARS OF AGE</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride should not be used in children under six years, since safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride should be given cautiously to emotionally unstable patients, such as those with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism, because such patients may increase dosage on their own initiative.</p><p>Chronically abusive use can lead to marked tolerance and psychic dependence with varying degrees of abnormal behavior. Frank psychotic episodes can occur, especially with parenteral abuse. Careful supervision is required during drug withdrawal, since severe depression as well as the effects of chronic overactivity can be unmasked. Long-term follow-up may be required because of the patient's basic personality disturbances.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>Patients with an element of agitation may react adversely; discontinue therapy if necessary.</p><p>Periodic CBC, differential, and platelet counts are advised during prolonged therapy.</p><p>Drug treatment is not indicated in all cases of this behavioral syndrome and should be considered only in light of the complete history and evaluation of the child. The decision to prescribe methylphenidate hydrochloride should depend on the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child's symptoms and their appropriateness for his/her age. Prescription should not depend solely on the presence of one or more of the behavioral characteristics.</p><p>When these symptoms are associated with acute stress reactions, treatment with methylphenidate hydrochloride is usually not indicated.</p><p>Long-term effects of methylphenidate hydrochloride in children have not been well established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></p><p>Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with methylphenidate and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide is available for methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.</p><p><span class="Bold">Priapism</span></p><p>Advise patients, caregivers, and family members of the possibility of painful or prolonged penile erections (priapism). <span class="Bold">Instruct the patient to seek immediate medical attention in the event of </span><span class="Bold">priapism.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Circulation Problems in Fingers and Toes [Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud’s Phenomenon]</span></p><ul>
<li>Instruct patients beginning treatment with methylphenidate hydrochloride about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s Phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change color from pale, to blue, to red.</li>
<li>Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking methylphenidate hydrochloride.</span></li>
<li>Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. Use cautiously with pressor agents.</p><p>Human pharmacologic studies have shown that methylphenidate hydrochloride may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants, anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, primidone), phenylbutazone, and tricyclic drugs (imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine). Downward dosage adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate hydrochloride.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and, in males only, an increase in hepatoblastomas, at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 30 times and 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.</p><p>Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 22 times and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively.</p><p>Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames reverse mutation assay or in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay. Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased, indicative of a weak clastogenic response, in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The genotoxic potential of methylphenidate has not been evaluated in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assay.</p><p><span class="Bold">Usage in Pregnancy</span></p><p>Adequate animal reproduction studies to establish safe use of methylphenidate hydrochloride during pregnancy have not been conducted. However, in a recently conducted study, methylphenidate has been shown to have teratogenic effects in rabbits when given in doses of 200 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 167 times and 78 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. In rats, teratogenic effects were not seen when the drug was given in doses of 75 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 62.5 and 13.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg and a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, respectively. Therefore, until more information is available, methylphenidate should not be prescribed for women of childbearing age unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Nervousness and insomnia are the most common adverse reactions but are usually controlled by reducing dosage and omitting the drug in the afternoon or evening. Other reactions include hypersensitivity (including skin rash, urticaria, fever, arthralgia, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme with histopathological findings of necrotizing vasculitis, and thrombocytopenic purpura); anorexia; nausea; dizziness; palpitations; headache; dyskinesia; drowsiness; blood pressure and pulse changes, both up and down; tachycardia; angina; cardiac arrhythmia; abdominal pain; weight loss during prolonged therapy; libido changes; and rhabdomyolysis. There have been rare reports of Tourette’s syndrome. Toxic psychosis has been reported. Although a definite causal relationship has not been established, the following have been reported in patients taking this drug: instances of abnormal liver function, ranging from transaminase elevation to severe hepatic injury; isolated cases of cerebral arteritis and/or occlusion; leukopenia and/or anemia; transient depressed mood; a few instances of scalp hair loss; serotonin syndrome in combination with serotonergic drugs. Very rare reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been received, and, in most of these, patients were concurrently receiving therapies associated with NMS. In a single report, a ten year old boy who had been taking methylphenidate for approximately 18 months experienced an NMS-like event within 45 minutes of ingesting his first dose of venlafaxine. It is uncertain whether this case represented a drug-drug interaction, a response to either drug alone, or some other cause.</p><p>In children, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, weight loss during prolonged therapy, insomnia, and tachycardia may occur more frequently; however, any of the other adverse reactions listed above may also occur.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Signs and symptoms of acute overdosage, resulting principally from overstimulation of the central nervous system and from excessive sympathomimetic effects, may include the following: vomiting, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, convulsions (may be followed by coma), euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, and rhabdomyolysis.</p><p>Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center regarding treatment for up-to-date guidance and advice.</p><p>Treatment consists of appropriate supportive measures. The patient must be protected against self-injury and against external stimuli that would aggravate overstimulation already present. Gastric contents may be evacuated by gastric lavage. In the presence of severe intoxication, use a carefully titrated dosage of a <span class="Italics">short-acting</span> barbiturate before performing gastric lavage. Other measures to detoxify the gut include administration of activated charcoal and a cathartic.</p><p>Intensive care must be provided to maintain adequate circulation and respiratory exchange; external cooling procedures may be required for hyperpyrexia.</p><p>Efficacy of peritoneal dialysis or extracorporeal hemodialysis for methylphenidate overdosage has not been established.</p><h2>Methylphenidate Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Dosage should be individualized according to the needs and responses of the patient.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>Administer in divided doses 2 or 3 times daily, preferably 30 to 45 minutes before meals. Average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily. Some patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily. In others, 10 to 15 mg daily will be adequate. Patients who are unable to sleep if medication is taken late in the day should take the last dose before 6 p.m.</p><p><span class="Bold">Children (6 years and over)</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride should be initiated in small doses, with gradual weekly increments. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended.</p><p>If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued.</p><p>Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly.</p><p>If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse effects occur, reduce dosage, or, if necessary, discontinue the drug.</p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride should be periodically discontinued to assess the child's condition. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued.</p><p>Drug treatment should not and need not be indefinite and usually may be discontinued after puberty.</p><h2>How is Methylphenidate Oral Solution Supplied</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride oral solution 5 mg per 5 mL is available as a clear colorless liquid.</p><p>                  Bottles of 250 mL . . . . . . . .
