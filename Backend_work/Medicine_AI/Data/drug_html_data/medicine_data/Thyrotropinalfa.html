Thyrotropin alfa keeps your TSH levels steady while you undergo thyroid tests or treatments that can reduce TSH and cause symptoms of low thyroid (hypothyroidism).</p><p>Thyrotropin alfa is used together with radioactive iodine ablation (a procedure to remove thyroid tissue that was not removed with surgery) in people with thyroid cancer.</p><p>Thyrotropin alfa is also used during medical testing to check for certain types of thyroid cancer that has returned after treatment. Thyrotropin alfa may not help your doctor find all signs of cancer, and there is still a chance that some of your cancer could be missed.</p><p>Thyrotropin alfa will not treat cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.</p><p>Thyrotropin alfa may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before using thyrotropin alfa tell your doctor about all your medical conditions or allergies, all medicines you use, and if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.</p><p>Carefully follow your doctor's instructions about the timing of your medications, scans, and other treatments.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use thyrotropin alfa if you are allergic to it.</p><p>To make sure thyrotropin alfa is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2>How is thyrotropin alfa given?</h2><p>Thyrotropin alfa is injected into a muscle of the buttock. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Thyrotropin alfa is usually given in 2 separate injections 24 hours apart.</p><p>You may also be given radioactive iodine to take 24 hours after your last thyrotropin alfa injection. If you need a thyroid scan, the scan should take place 48 hours after you take the radioactive iodine.</p><p><b>Carefully follow your doctor's instructions about the timing of your medications, scans, and other treatments.</b></p><p>You may be given steroid medicine to help keep tumors from growing larger while you are receiving thyrotropin alfa.</p><p>Your doctor may want you to receive this medicine in a hospital or clinic setting to quickly treat any serious side effects that occur.</p><p>Drink plenty of liquids before you are treated with thyrotropin alfa.</p><p>As part of your treatment, you will need frequent blood tests.
