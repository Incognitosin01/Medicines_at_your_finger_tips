Cysteamine is used in people with cystinosis (SIS-tin-OH-sis), a rare genetic condition that causes a build-up of cystine in the kidneys and other organs, including the eyes.</p><p>Cystadrops (for the eyes) is used to keep cystine crystals from building up in the cornea (surface of the eye).</p><p>Cystadrops may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
