It is used to treat a number of medical problems. These include:</p><ul>
<li>Cancer of the prostate in men</li>
<li>Cancer of the breast in women if it develops before or around the time of menopause</li>
<li>Endometriosis, a painful condition caused by extra tissue growing inside or outside of the uterus, and</li>
<li>Thinning of the lining of the uterus before surgery on the uterus.</li>
</ul><p>When given regularly as an implant, goserelin works every day to decrease the amount of estrogen and testosterone in the blood.</p><p>Reducing the amount of estrogen in the body is one way of treating endometriosis and cancer of the breast, and can help thin the uterus lining before surgery. Goserelin prevents the growth of tissue associated with endometriosis in adult women during treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment is discontinued.</p><p>Reducing the amount of testosterone in the body is one way of treating cancer of the prostate.</p><p>Suppressing estrogen can thin the bones or slow their growth. This is a problem for adult women whose bones are no longer growing like the bones of children. This is why goserelin is used only for up to 6 months in adult women treated for endometriosis.</p><p>Goserelin is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using goserelin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of goserelin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you goserelin. Goserelin is given as a shot under your skin near your stomach. Goserelin may be given once every 28 days or once every 3 months. Your schedule depends on the reason you are using goserelin. To stay on the right schedule with the medicine, make sure you keep all appointments.</p><p>It is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even after you begin to feel better.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using goserelin</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that goserelin is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>For female patients: You should not receive goserelin if you are pregnant or may become pregnant. Using goserelin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Your birth control pills may not work as well while you are receiving goserelin. Use a nonhormonal form of birth control together with your pills to keep from getting pregnant while you are receiving goserelin and for at least 12 weeks after treatment. Nonhormonal birth control includes vaginal spermicides, condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>For female patients: During the time you are receiving goserelin, your menstrual period may not be regular or you may not have a menstrual period at all. This is to be expected when being treated with goserelin. If regular menstrual periods continue during treatment or do not begin within 2 to 3 months after you stop using goserelin, check with your doctor.</p><p>When you first start using goserelin for cancer treatment, some of your symptoms might get worse for a short time. You might also have new symptoms. You might have bone pain, back pain, or trouble urinating. These symptoms should improve within a few weeks. Tell your doctor if you have any new symptoms or your symptoms get worse.</p><p>For male patients: Goserelin may affect blood sugar levels. If you are diabetic and notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests, check with your doctor.</p><p>For male patients: Goserelin may increase risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or discomfort, confusion, double vision, headache, nausea or vomiting, slow speech, sweating, trouble speaking, or trouble moving the arms, legs, or facial muscles.</p><p>Goserelin can cause decreases in bone mineral density, which may lead to osteoporosis or weakened bones. Talk with your doctor about how this risk will affect you.</p><p>Goserelin may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using goserelin.</p><p>Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat.
