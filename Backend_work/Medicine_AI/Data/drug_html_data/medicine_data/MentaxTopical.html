This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>There is no specific information comparing use of butenafine in children with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of butenafine in the elderly with use in other age groups, clinical studies included older patients. No differences in effects of butenafine were seen in the elderly compared with younger adults.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Mentax</h2><p>Apply enough butenafine to cover the affected skin and surrounding areas, and rub in gently.</p><p>After applying butenafine, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.</p><p>Keep this medicine away from the eyes and mucous membranes such as the inside of the nose, mouth, or vagina.</p><p>Do not bandage or apply an occlusive dressing (airtight covering such as kitchen plastic wrap) over this medicine unless otherwise directed by your doctor. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>To help clear up your skin infection completely, keep using butenafine for the full time of treatment. It may sometimes take quite a while for a fungus infection to be cured. If you stop using this medicine too soon, your symptoms will return.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

These changes in color can last for months even when the fungal infection has been eliminated. Continuing treatment longer than recommended will not cause skin color to return to normal faster. Consult your physician if you believe the fungal infection may have returned.</p><p>To help clear up your skin infection completely and to help make sure it does not return, the following good health habits are important:</p><ul>

<ul>
<li>Carefully dry the feet, especially between the toes, after bathing.</li>

<li>Wear well-ventilated shoes (for example, shoes with holes on top or on the side) or sandals.</li>
<li>Use a bland, absorbent powder (for example, talcum powder) or an antifungal powder freely between the toes, on the feet, and in socks and shoes once or twice a day. Be sure to use the powder after butenafine has been applied and has disappeared into the skin. Do not use the powder as the only treatment for your fungus infection.</li>
</ul>
