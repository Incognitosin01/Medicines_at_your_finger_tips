</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies. These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">KHEDEZLA is not approved for use in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Khedezla Extended Release</h2><p class="First">KHEDEZLA is indicated for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><h2>Khedezla Extended Release Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Instructions for Use</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose for KHEDEZLA is 50 mg once daily, with or without food. The 50 mg dose is both a starting dose and the therapeutic dose.  KHEDEZLA should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  Tablets must be swallowed whole with fluid and not divided, crushed, chewed, or dissolved.</p><p>In clinical studies, doses of 50 mg to 400 mg per day were shown to be effective, although no additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 50 mg per day and adverse reactions and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses.</p><p>When discontinuing therapy, gradual dose reduction is recommended whenever possible to minimize discontinuation symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The maximum recommended dose in patients with moderate renal impairment (24-hr creatinine clearance [Cl<span class="Sub">Cr</span>] = 30 to 50 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault [C-G]) is 50 mg per day. The maximum recommended dose in patients with severe renal impairment (24-hr Cl<span class="Sub">Cr</span> less than 30 mL/min, C-G) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is 50 mg every other day. Supplemental doses should not be given to patients after dialysis <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 15) is 50 mg per day. Dose escalation above 100 mg per day is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Maintenance/Continuation/Extended Treatment</h3><p class="First">It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment.</p><h3>Discontinuing KHEDEZLA</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of KHEDEZLA <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping KHEDEZLA abruptly whenever possible.</span></p><h3>Switching Patients from Other Antidepressants to KHEDEZLA</h3><p class="First">Discontinuation symptoms have been reported when switching patients from other antidepressants, including venlafaxine, to desvenlafaxine. Tapering of the initial antidepressant may be necessary to minimize discontinuation symptoms.</p><h3>Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders</h3><p class="First"> At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with KHEDEZLA. Conversely, at least 7 days should be allowed after stopping KHEDEZLA before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4)]</span>. </p><h3>Use of KHEDEZLA with other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue</h3><p class="First">Do not start KHEDEZLA in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome.  In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>In some cases, a patient already receiving KHEDEZLA therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.  If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, KHEDEZLA should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered.  The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 7 days or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first.  Therapy with KHEDEZLA may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with KHEDEZLA is unclear.  The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">KHEDEZLA (desvenlafaxine) Extended-release Tablets are available as 50 and 100 mg tablets.</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled studies of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term studies of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term studies (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">                                                          Table 1</span></p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p><p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</p><p>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><p>Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.</p><p>Prescriptions for KHEDEZLA should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Screening patients for bipolar disorder</span></span></p><p>A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled studies) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that KHEDEZLA is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including KHEDEZLA, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition.  The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort), and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin i.e., MAOIs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.  Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).  </span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The concomitant use of KHEDEZLA with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate KHEDEZLA in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking KHEDEZLA, discontinue KHEDEZLA before initiating treatment with the MAOI <span class="Italics">[see </span><span class="Italics">Contraindications </span><span class="Italics">(4) </span><span class="Italics">and </span><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Monitor all patients taking KHEDEZLA for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.  Discontinue treatment with KHEDEZLA and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment.  If concomitant use of KHEDEZLA with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</span></p><h3>Elevated Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving KHEDEZLA should have regular monitoring of blood pressure since increases in blood pressure were observed in clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before initiating treatment with desvenlafaxine. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular conditions that might be compromised by increases in blood pressure. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported with desvenlafaxine.</p><p>Sustained blood pressure increases could have adverse consequences. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving KHEDEZLA, either dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including KHEDEZLA, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of KHEDEZLA and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing KHEDEZLA.</span></p><h3>Angle Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including KHEDEZLA may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including KHEDEZLA, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.</span></p><h3>Activation of Mania/Hypomania</h3><p class="First">During all MDD phase 2 and phase 3 studies, mania was reported for approximately 0.02% of patients treated with desvenlafaxine. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, KHEDEZLA should be used cautiously in patients with a history or family history of mania or hypomania.</p><h3>Discontinuation Syndrome</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Seizure</h3><p class="First">Cases of seizure have been reported in pre-marketing clinical studies with desvenlafaxine. Desvenlafaxine has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from pre-marketing clinical studies. KHEDEZLA should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.</p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including KHEDEZLA. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted can be at greater risk <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinuation of KHEDEZLA should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.</p><h3>Interstitial Lung Disease and Eosinophilic Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Interstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia associated with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine) therapy have been rarely reported. The possibility of these adverse events should be considered in patients treated with KHEDEZLA who present with progressive dyspnea, cough, or chest discomfort. Such patients should undergo a prompt medical evaluation, and discontinuation of KHEDEZLA should be considered.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First">Desvenlafaxine was evaluated for safety in 4,158 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder who participated in multiple-dose pre-marketing studies, representing 1,677 patient-years of exposure. Among these 4,158 desvenlafaxine treated patients; 1,834 patients were exposed to desvenlafaxine in 8-week, placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/day. Out of the 1,834 patients, 687 desvenlafaxine treated patients continued into a 10-month open-label study. Of the total 4,158 patients exposed to at least one dose of desvenlafaxine; 1,320 were exposed to desvenlafaxine for 6 months, representing 1058 patient-years of exposure, and 274 were exposed for one year, representing 241 patient-years of exposure.</p><p class="First">In the pooled 8-week placebo-controlled studies in patients with MDD, 12% of the 1,834 patients who received desvenlafaxine (50 to 400 mg) discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 3% of the 1,116 placebo-treated patients. At the recommended dose of 50 mg, the discontinuation rate due to an adverse reaction for desvenlafaxine (4.1%) was similar to the rate for placebo (3.8%). For the 100 mg dose of desvenlafaxine the discontinuation rate due to an adverse reaction was 8.7%.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in at least 2% and at a rate greater than placebo of the desvenlafaxine treated patients in the short-term studies, up to 8 weeks, were: nausea (4%); dizziness, headache and vomiting (2% each); in the longer-term studies, up to 11 months, the most common was vomiting (2%).</p><p class="First">The most commonly observed adverse reactions in desvenlafaxine treated MDD patients in short-term fixed-dose studies (incidence ≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo in the 50 or 100 mg dose groups) were: nausea, dizziness, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, constipation, somnolence, decreased appetite, anxiety, and specific male sexual function disorders.</p><p>Table 2 shows the incidence of common adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of desvenlafaxine treated MDD patients and twice the rate of placebo at any dose in the pooled 8-week, placebo-controlled, fixed dose clinical studies</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% in any Fixed-Dose Group and Twice the Rate of Placebo) in Pooled MDD 8-Week Placebo-Controlled Studies</span></p><p class="First">Table 3 shows the incidence of sexual function adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of desvenlafaxine treated MDD patients in any fixed-dose group (pooled 8-week, placebo-controlled, fixed and flexible-dose, clinical studies).</p><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n=397)      </span></p><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">50 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n=209)</span></p><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">100 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n=267)   </span></p><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">200 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n=176)</span></p><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">400 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n=163)</span></p><p class="First">Other infrequent adverse reactions, not described elsewhere in the label, occurring at an incidence of &lt; 2% in MDD patients treated with desvenlafaxine were:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiac disorders</span></span> – Tachycardia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions</span></span> – Asthenia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Investigations –</span></span> Weight increased, liver function test abnormal, blood prolactin increased.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders –</span></span> Musculoskeletal stiffness.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders –</span></span>Syncope, convulsion, dystonia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders –</span></span> Depersonalization, bruxism.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal and urinary disorders</span></span> – Urinary retention.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span></span> <span class="Bold">–</span> Rash, alopecia, photosensitivity reaction, angioedema.</p><p>In clinical studies, there were uncommon reports of ischemic cardiac adverse reactions, including myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and coronary occlusion requiring revascularization; these patients had multiple underlying cardiac risk factors.

However, desvenlafaxine is the major active metabolite of venlafaxine. Overdose experience reported with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine) is presented below; the identical information can be found in the Overdosage section of the venlafaxine package insert.</p><p>In postmarketing experience, overdose with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine) has occurred predominantly in combination with alcohol and/or other drugs. The most commonly reported events in overdosage include tachycardia, changes in level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), mydriasis, seizures, and vomiting. Electrocardiogram changes (e.g., prolongation of QT interval, bundle branch block, QRS prolongation), sinus and ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, vertigo, liver necrosis, serotonin syndrome, and death have been reported.</p><p>Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcomes compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Epidemiological studies have shown that venlafaxine-treated patients have a higher pre-existing burden of suicide risk factors than SSRI-treated patients. The extent to which the finding of an increased risk of fatal outcomes can be attributed to the toxicity of venlafaxine in overdosage, as opposed to some characteristic(s) of venlafaxine-treated patients, is not clear.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">No specific antidotes for KHEDEZLA are known.

Non-clinical studies have shown that desvenlafaxine is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Desvenlafaxine lacked significant affinity for numerous receptors, including muscarinic-cholinergic, H<span class="Sub">1</span>-histaminergic, or α<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptors <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Desvenlafaxine also lacked monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">ECG changes</span></span></p><p>Electrocardiograms were obtained from 1,492 desvenlafaxine treated patients with major depressive disorder and 984 placebo-treated patients in clinical studies lasting up to 8 weeks. No clinically relevant differences were observed between desvenlafaxine treated and placebo-treated patients for QT, QTc, PR, and QRS intervals. In a thorough QTc study with prospectively determined criteria, desvenlafaxine did not cause QT prolongation. No difference was observed between placebo and desvenlafaxine treatments for the QRS interval.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The single-dose pharmacokinetics of desvenlafaxine are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 100 to 600 mg/day. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately 4 to 5 days. At steady-state, multiple-dose accumulation of desvenlafaxine is linear and predictable from the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile.</p><p>The mean ± SD terminal half-life, t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>, after administration of KHEDEZLA is about 9.5 ± 1.5  hours.

There was no clinically significant food effect seen when KHEDEZLA was administered with a high fat meal. Therefore, KHEDEZLA can be taken without regard to meals <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. </p><p>The plasma protein binding of desvenlafaxine is low (30%) and is independent of drug concentration.

CYP3A4 is the cytochrome P450 isozyme mediating the oxidative metabolism (N-demethylation) of desvenlafaxine. The CYP2D6 metabolic pathway is not involved, and after administration of 100 mg, the pharmacokinetics of desvenlafaxine was similar in subjects with CYP2D6 poor and extensive metabolizer phenotype. Approximately 45% of desvenlafaxine is excreted unchanged in urine at 72 hours after oral administration. Approximately 19% of the administered dose is excreted as the glucuronide metabolite and &lt;5% as the oxidative metabolite (N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine) in urine.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole)</span></p><p>CYP3A4 is a minor pathway for the metabolism of desvenlafaxine.

Increases in AUCs of about 42% in mild renal impairment (24-hr CrCl = 50 to 80 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault [C-G]), about 56% in moderate renal impairment (24-hr CrCl = 30 to 50 mL/min, C-G), about 108% in severe renal impairment (24-hr CrCl ≤30 mL/min, C-G), and about 116% in ESRD subjects were observed, compared with healthy, age-matched control subjects.</p><p>The mean terminal half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) was prolonged from 11.1 hours in the control subjects to approximately 13.5, 15.5, 17.6, and 22.8 hours in mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and ESRD subjects, respectively. Less than 5% of the drug in the body was cleared during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure.</p><p>The maximum recommended dose in patients with moderate renal impairment is 50 mg per day.

The AUC exposure at 300 mg/kg/day dose is estimated at 10-times the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day.</p><p>Rats received desvenlafaxine succinate at dosages up to 300 mg/kg/day (males) or 500 mg/kg/day (females).

There was no effect on fertility at 100 mg/kg/day, which is 3 (males) or 5 (females) times the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day. These studies did not address reversibility of the effect on fertility. The relevance of these findings to humans is not known.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of desvenlafaxine as a treatment for depression was established in four 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies (at doses of 50 mg per day to 400 mg per day) in adult outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder. In the first study, patients received 100 mg (n = 114), 200 mg (n = 116), or 400 mg (n = 113) of desvenlafaxine once daily, or placebo (n = 118). In a second study, patients received either 200 mg (n = 121) or 400 mg (n = 124) of desvenlafaxine once daily, or placebo (n = 124). In two additional studies, patients received 50 mg (n = 150 and n = 164) or 100 mg (n = 147 and n = 158) of desvenlafaxine once daily, or placebo (n = 150 and n = 161).</p><p>Desvenlafaxine showed superiority over placebo as measured by improvement in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D<span class="Sub">17</span>) total score in four studies and overall improvement, as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions Scale - Improvement (CGI-I), in three of the four studies. In studies directly comparing 50 mg per day and 100 mg per day there was no suggestion of a greater effect with the higher dose and adverse reactions and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 9:  Primary Efficacy (HAM-D<span class="Sub">17</span>) Results for Short-term Studies</span> </p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary Endpoint:</span> <span class="Bold">HAM-D<span class="Sub">17</span></span></p><p class="First">Baseline Score (SD<span class="Sup">a</span>)</p><p class="First"> Difference from Placebo (95% CI<span class="Sup">c</span>)</p><p class="First"> 23.4 (2.6)</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">a</span>  Standard deviation;</p><p>Analyses of the relationships between treatment outcome and age and treatment outcome and gender did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.
