Any unused solution should be discarded according to institutional procedures for antineoplastics.</p><h3>Admixture Stability</h3><p class="First">Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection contains no antimicrobial preservative. The admixture should be prepared as close as possible to the time of patient administration.</p><p>Once diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the final admixture is stable for 24 hours when stored under refrigerated (2° to 8°C or 36° to 46°F) or for 3 hours when stored at room temperature (15° to 30°C or 59° to 86°F) and room light. Administration of diluted Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection must be completed within this period of time. Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection is a multiple-dose vial. Retain the partially used vial in original package to protect from light and store refrigerated (2° to 8°C or 36° to 46°F) if additional dose withdrawal from the same vial is intended.</p><h3>Stability of Partially Used Vials (Needle Punched Vials)</h3><p class="First">Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection is a multiple-dose vial. Although it does not contain any antimicrobial preservative, Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection is bacteriostatic and does not support bacterial growth. The partially used vials are stable for up to 28 days when stored in its original carton under refrigeration (2° to 8°C or 36° to 46°F). Each vial is not recommended for more than a total of six (6) dose withdrawals.</p><p>After first use, the partially used vial should be stored in original carton at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F), and then discarded after 28 days.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection; 100mg/4mL (25mg/mL) as a ready-to-dilute clear and colorless to yellow solution in a multiple-dose vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions) to bendamustine, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, or monothioglycerol. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">Bendamustine hydrochloride caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies (<span class="Italics">see</span> Table 4). Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV).</p><p>In the event of treatment-related myelosuppression, monitor leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be ≥ 1 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L and the platelet count should be ≥ 75 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L. <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and (2.2)]</span></p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, hepatitis and death has occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports for bendamustine hydrochloride. Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following bendamustine hydrochloride treatment to contact a physician immediately if they have symptoms or signs of infection.</p><p>Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride are at risk for reactivation of infections including (but not limited to) hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and herpes zoster. Patients should undergo appropriate measures (including clinical and laboratory monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment) for infection and infection reactivation prior to administration.</p><h3>Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions</h3><p class="First">Infusion reactions to bendamustine hydrochloride have occurred commonly in clinical trials. Symptoms include fever, chills, pruritus and rash. In rare instances severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions after their first cycle of therapy. Patients who experience Grade 3 or worse allergic-type reactions should not be rechallenged. Consider measures to prevent severe reactions, including antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions. Discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride for patients with Grade 4 infusion reactions. Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusion reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits, risks, and supportive care.</p><h3>Tumor Lysis Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Tumor lysis syndrome associated with bendamustine hydrochloride has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in post-marketing reports. The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of bendamustine hydrochloride and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include vigorous hydration and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of bendamustine hydrochloride therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when bendamustine hydrochloride and allopurinol are administered concomitantly. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></p><h3>Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Fatal and serious skin reactions have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports, including toxic skin reactions [Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), bullous exanthema, and rash. Events occurred when bendamustine hydrochloride was given as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents or allopurinol.</p><p>Where skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor patients with skin reactions closely. If skin reactions are severe or progressive, withhold or discontinue bendamustine hydrochloride.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride injection. Combination therapy, progressive disease or reactivation of hepatitis B were confounding factors in some patients. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> Most cases were reported within the first three months of starting therapy. Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during bendamustine therapy.</p><h3>Other Malignancies</h3><p class="First">There are reports of pre-malignant and malignant diseases that have developed in patients who have been treated with bendamustine hydrochloride, including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia and bronchial carcinoma.</p><h3>Extravasation Injury</h3><p class="First">Bendamustine hydrochloride extravasations have been reported in post marketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema, marked swelling, and pain. Assure good venous access prior to starting bendamustine hydrochloride infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis during and after administration of bendamustine hydrochloride.</p><h3>Embryo-fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine in mice and rats administered during organogenesis caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations, and decreased fetal body weights. <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions have been associated with bendamustine hydrochloride in clinical trials and are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</span></p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 153 patients with CLL studied in an active-controlled, randomized trial. The population was 45-77 years of age, 63% male, 100% white, and were treatment naïve. All patients started the study at a dose of 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 every 28 days.</p><p>Adverse reactions were reported according to NCI CTC v.2.0. Non-hematologic adverse reactions (any grade) in the bendamustine hydrochloride group that occurred with a frequency greater than 15% were pyrexia (24%), nausea (20%), and vomiting (16%).</p><p>Other adverse reactions seen frequently in one or more studies included asthenia, fatigue, malaise, and weakness; dry mouth; somnolence; cough; constipation; headache; mucosal inflammation and stomatitis.</p><p>Worsening hypertension was reported in 4 patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride in the CLL trial and in none treated with chlorambucil. Three of these 4 adverse reactions were described as a hypertensive crisis and were managed with oral medications and resolved.</p><p>The most frequent adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal for patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride were hypersensitivity (2%) and pyrexia (1%).</p><p>Table 1 contains the treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of attribution, that were reported in ≥ 5% of patients in either treatment group in the randomized CLL clinical study.</p><p>The Grade 3 and 4 hematology laboratory test values by treatment group in the randomized CLL clinical study are described in Table 2. These findings confirm the myelosuppressive effects seen in patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride. Red blood cell transfusions were administered to 20% of patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride compared with 6% of patients receiving chlorambucil.</p><p>In the CLL trial, 34% of patients had bilirubin elevations, some without associated significant elevations in AST and ALT. Grade 3 or 4 increased bilirubin occurred in 3% of patients. Increases in AST and ALT of Grade 3 or 4 were limited to 1% and 3% of patients, respectively. Patients treated with bendamustine hydrochloride may also have changes in their creatinine levels. If abnormalities are detected, monitoring of these parameters should be continued to ensure that further deterioration does not occur.</p><p><span class="Bold">Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</span><br/>
The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 176 patients with indolent B-cell NHL treated in two single-arm studies. The population was 31-84 years of age, 60% male, and 40% female. The race distribution was 89% White, 7% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% other, and &lt;1% Asian. These patients received bendamustine hydrochloride at a dose of 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21-day cycles.</p><p>The adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of the NHL patients, regardless of severity, are shown in Table 3. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (≥30%) were nausea (75%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%). The most common non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥5%) were fatigue (11%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> Patients counted only once in each preferred term category and once in each system organ class category</p><p>Hematologic toxicities, based on laboratory values and CTC grade, in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined are described in Table 4. Clinically important chemistry laboratory values that were new or worsened from baseline and occurred in &gt;1% of patients at Grade 3 or 4, in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined were hyperglycemia (3%), elevated creatinine (2%), hyponatremia (2%), and hypocalcemia (2%).</p><p>In both studies, serious adverse reactions, regardless of causality, were reported in 37% of patients receiving bendamustine hydrochloride. The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Other important serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or post-marketing experience were acute renal failure, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity, skin reactions, pulmonary fibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome.</p><p>Serious drug-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials included myelosuppression, infection, pneumonia, tumor lysis syndrome and infusion reactions. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span> Adverse reactions occurring less frequently but possibly related to bendamustine hydrochloride treatment were hemolysis, dysgeusia/taste disorder, atypical pneumonia, sepsis, herpes zoster, erythema, dermatitis, and skin necrosis.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bendamustine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and lymphatic systems disorders:</span> Pancytopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular disorders:</span> Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (some fatal), myocardial infarction (some fatal), palpitation</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions:</span> Injection site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling), infusion site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling)</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders:</span> Anaphylaxis</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and infestations:</span> Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:</span> Pneumonitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:</span> Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS (Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms). <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No formal clinical assessments of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between bendamustine hydrochloride and other drugs have been conducted.</p><p>Bendamustine's active metabolites, gamma-hydroxy bendamustine (M3) and N-desmethyl-bendamustine (M4), are formed via cytochrome P450 CYP1A2. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) have potential to increase plasma concentrations of bendamustine and decrease plasma concentrations of active metabolites. Inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g., omeprazole, smoking) have potential to decrease plasma concentrations of bendamustine and increase plasma concentrations of its active metabolites. Caution should be used, or alternative treatments considered if concomitant treatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors or inducers is needed.</p><p>The role of active transport systems in bendamustine distribution has not been fully evaluated. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data suggest that P-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and/or other efflux transporters may have a role in bendamustine transport.</p><p>Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data, bendamustine is not likely to inhibit metabolism via human CYP isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5, or to induce metabolism of substrates of cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category D <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Bendamustine hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Bendamustine caused malformations in animals, when a single dose was administered to pregnant animals. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving bendamustine hydrochloride and for 3 months after therapy has stopped. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise men receiving bendamustine hydrochloride to use reliable contraception for the same time period.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal data</span></p><p>Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine from 210 mg/m2 (70 mg/kg) in mice administered during organogenesis caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations (exencephaly, cleft palates, accessory rib, and spinal deformities) and decreased fetal body weights. This dose did not appear to be maternally toxic and lower doses were not evaluated. Repeat intraperitoneal dosing in mice on gestation days 7-11 resulted in an increase in resorptions from 75 mg/m2 (25 mg/kg) and an increase in abnormalities from 112.5 mg/m2 (37.5 mg/kg) similar to those seen after a single intraperitoneal administration. Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine from 120 mg/m2 (20 mg/kg) in rats administered on gestation days 4, 7, 9, 11, or 13 caused embryo and fetal lethality as indicated by increased resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses. A significant increase in external [effect on tail, head, and herniation of external organs (exomphalos)] and internal (hydronephrosis and hydrocephalus) malformations were seen in dosed rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants and tumorigenicity shown for bendamustine in animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of bendamustine hydrochloride in pediatric patients has not been established. Bendamustine hydrochloride was evaluated in a single Phase 1/2 trial in pediatric patients with leukemia. The safety profile for bendamustine hydrochloride in pediatric patients was consistent with that seen in adults, and no new safety signals were identified.</p><p>The trial included pediatric patients from 1-19 years of age with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, including 27 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 16 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Bendamustine hydrochloride was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 21-day cycle. Doses of 90 and 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> were evaluated. The Phase 1 portion of the study determined that the recommended Phase 2 dose of bendamustine hydrochloride in pediatric patients was 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p>A total of 32 patients entered the Phase 2 portion of the study at the recommended dose and were evaluated for response. There was no treatment response (CR+ CRp) in any patient at this dose. However, there were 2 patients with ALL who achieved a CR at a dose of 90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in the Phase 1 portion of the study.</p><p>In the above-mentioned pediatric trial, the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine hydrochloride at 90 and 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> doses were evaluated in 5 and 38 patients, respectively, aged 1 to 19 years (median age of 10 years).</p><p>The geometric mean body surface adjusted clearance of bendamustine was 14.2 L/h/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The exposures (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) to bendamustine in pediatric patients following a 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenous infusion over 60 minutes were similar to those in adult patients following the same 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In CLL and NHL studies, there were no clinically significant differences in the adverse reaction profile between geriatric (≥ 65 years of age) and younger patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</span><br/>
In the randomized CLL clinical study, 153 patients received bendamustine hydrochloride. The overall response rate for patients younger than 65 years of age was 70% (n=82) for bendamustine hydrochloride and 30% (n=69) for chlorambucil. The overall response rate for patients 65 years or older was 47% (n=71) for bendamustine hydrochloride and 22% (n=79) for chlorambucil. In patients younger than 65 years of age, the median progression-free survival was 19 months in the bendamustine hydrochloride group and 8 months in the chlorambucil group. In patients 65 years or older, the median progression-free survival was 12 months in the bendamustine hydrochloride group and 8 months in the chlorambucil group.</p><p><span class="Bold">Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</span><br/>
Efficacy (Overall Response Rate and Duration of Response) was similar in patients &lt; 65 years of age and patients ≥ 65 years. Irrespective of age, all of the 176 patients experienced at least one adverse reaction.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No formal studies assessing the impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine have been conducted. Bendamustine hydrochloride should not be used in patients with CrCL less than 30 mL/min. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No formal studies assessing the impact of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine have been conducted. Bendamustine hydrochloride should not be used in patients with moderate (AST or ALT 2.5-10 X ULN and total bilirubin 1.5-3 X ULN) or severe (total bilirubin greater than 3 X ULN) hepatic impairment. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><h3>Effect of Gender</h3><p class="First">No clinically significant differences between genders were seen in the overall incidences of adverse reactions in CLL or NHL studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</span><br/>
In the randomized CLL clinical study, the overall response rate (ORR) for men (n=97) and women (n=56) in the bendamustine hydrochloride group was 60% and 57%, respectively. The ORR for men (n=90) and women (n=58) in the chlorambucil group was 24% and 28%, respectively. In this study, the median progression-free survival for men was 19 months in the bendamustine hydrochloride treatment group and 6 months in the chlorambucil treatment group. For women, the median progression-free survival was 13 months in the bendamustine hydrochloride treatment group and 8 months in the chlorambucil treatment group.</p><p><span class="Bold">Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</span><br/>
The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were similar in male and female patients with indolent NHL. No clinically-relevant differences between genders were seen in efficacy (Overall Response Rate and Duration of Response).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The intravenous LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of bendamustine hydrochloride is 240 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in the mouse and rat. Toxicities included sedation, tremor, ataxia, convulsions and respiratory distress.</p><p>Across all clinical experience, the reported maximum single dose received was 280 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Three of four patients treated at this dose showed ECG changes considered dose-limiting at 7 and 21 days post-dosing. These changes included QT prolongation (one patient), sinus tachycardia (one patient), ST and T wave deviations (two patients) and left anterior fascicular block (one patient). Cardiac enzymes and ejection fractions remained normal in all patients.<br/>
No specific antidote for bendamustine hydrochloride overdose is known. Management of overdosage should include general supportive measures, including monitoring of hematologic parameters and ECGs.</p><h2>Bendamustine Injection Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient, bendamustine hydrochloride is an alkylating agent. The chemical name of bendamustine hydrochloride is 1H-benzimidazole-2-butanoic acid, 5-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-1 methyl-, monohydrochloride. Its empirical molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>·HCl, and the molecular weight is 394.7. Bendamustine hydrochloride contains a mechlorethamine group and a benzimidazole heterocyclic ring with a butyric acid substituent, and has the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection is intended for intravenous infusion only after dilution with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. It is supplied as a sterile multiple-dose, clear, colorless to yellow ready-to-dilute solution in a multiple-dose clear glass vial. Each milliliter of the injection contains 25 mg of bendamustine hydrochloride, 0.1 mL of propylene glycol, USP, 5 mg of monothioglycerol, NF and q.s. to 1 mL polyethylene glycol 400, NF.</p><h2>Bendamustine Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine-like benzimidazole ring. Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups. These groups form covalent bonds with electron-rich nucleophilic moieties, resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks. The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways. Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells. The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of data from adult NHL patients, nausea increased with increasing bendamustine C<span class="Sub">max</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span><br/>
The effect of bendamustine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 53 patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after administration of rituximab at 375 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenous infusion followed by a 30-minute intravenous infusion of bendamustine at 90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. No mean changes greater than 20 milliseconds were detected up to one hour post infusion. The potential for delayed effects on the QT interval after one hour was not evaluated.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
Following a single IV dose of bendamustine hydrochloride C<span class="Sub">max</span> typically occurred at the end of infusion. The dose proportionality of bendamustine has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, the binding of bendamustine to human serum plasma proteins ranged from 94-96% and was concentration independent from 1-50 μg/mL. Data suggest that bendamustine is not likely to displace or to be displaced by highly protein-bound drugs. The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 over a concentration range of 10 to 100 μg/mL indicating that bendamustine distributes freely in human red blood cells.</p><p>In a mass balance study, plasma radioactivity levels were sustained for a greater period of time than plasma concentrations of bendamustine, γ hydroxybendamustine (M3), and N desmethylbendamustine (M4). This suggests that there are bendamustine derived materials (detected via the radiolabel), that are rapidly cleared and have a longer half-life than bendamustine and its active metabolites.</p><p>The mean steady-state volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) of bendamustine was approximately 20-25 L. Steady-state volume of distribution for total radioactivity was approximately 50 L, indicating that neither bendamustine nor total radioactivity are extensively distributed into the tissues.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data indicate that bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to monohydroxy (HP1) and dihydroxy-bendamustine (HP2) metabolites with low cytotoxic activity. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, studies indicate that two active minor metabolites, M3 and M4, are primarily formed via CYP1A2. However, concentrations of these metabolites in plasma are 1/10<span class="Sup">th</span> and 1/100<span class="Sup">th</span> that of the parent compound, respectively, suggesting that the cytotoxic activity is primarily due to bendamustine.</p><p>Results of a human mass balance study confirm that bendamustine is extensively metabolized via hydrolytic, oxidative, and conjugative pathways.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes indicate that bendamustine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4/5. Bendamustine did not induce metabolism of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 enzymes in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/>
Mean recovery of total radioactivity in cancer patients following IV infusion of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C] bendamustine hydrochloride was approximately 76% of the dose. Approximately 50% of the dose was recovered in the urine and approximately 25% of the dose was recovered in the feces. Urinary excretion was confirmed as a relatively minor pathway of elimination of bendamustine, with approximately 3.3% of the dose recovered in the urine as parent. Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the urine as M3 and M4, and less than 5% of the dose was recovered in the urine as HP2.</p><p>Bendamustine clearance in humans is approximately 700 mL/minute. After a single dose of 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> bendamustine IV over 1-hour the intermediate t<span class="Sub">½</span> of the parent compound is approximately 40 minutes. The mean apparent terminal elimination t<span class="Sub">½</span> of M3 and M4 are approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes respectively. Little or no accumulation in plasma is expected for bendamustine administered on Days 1 and 2 of a 28-day cycle.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span><br/>
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of bendamustine in patients receiving 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> there was no meaningful effect of renal impairment (CrCL 30 - 80 mL/min, N=31) on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine. Bendamustine has not been studied in patients with CrCL less than 30 mL/min and should not be used in these patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of bendamustine in patients receiving 120 mg/m2 there was no meaningful effect of mild (total bilirubin ≤ ULN, AST ≥ ULN to 2.5 x ULN, and/or ALP ≥ ULN to 5 x ULN, N=26) hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine. Bendamustine has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>Bendamustine should not be used in patients with moderate (AST or ALT 2.5 – 10 x ULN and total bilirubin 1.5 – 3 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin greater than 3 x ULN) hepatic impairment. <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Age</span><br/>
Bendamustine exposure (as measured by AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) has been studied in patients ages 31 through 84 years. The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) were not significantly different between patients less than or greater than/equal to 65 years of age. <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4, 8.5)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Gender</span><br/>
The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were similar in male and female patients. <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Race</span><br/>
The effect of race on the safety, and/or efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride has not been established. Based on a cross-study comparison, Japanese subjects (n=6) had on average exposures that were 40% higher than non-Japanese subjects receiving the same dose. The significance of this difference on the safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride in Japanese subjects has not been established.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Bendamustine was carcinogenic in mice. After intraperitoneal injections at 37.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day (12.5 mg/kg/day, the lowest dose tested) and 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day (25 mg/kg/day) for four days, peritoneal sarcomas in female AB/jena mice were produced. Oral administration at 187.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day (62.5 mg/kg/day, the only dose tested) for four days induced mammary carcinomas and pulmonary adenomas.</p><p>Bendamustine is a mutagen and clastogen. In a reverse bacterial mutation assay (Ames assay), bendamustine was shown to increase revertant frequency in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Bendamustine was clastogenic in human lymphocytes <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, and in rat bone marrow cells <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes) from 37.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, the lowest dose tested.</p><p>Impaired spermatogenesis, azoospermia, and total germinal aplasia have been reported in male patients treated with alkylating agents, especially in combination with other drugs. In some instances spermatogenesis may return in patients in remission, but this may occur only several years after intensive chemotherapy has been discontinued. Patients should be warned of the potential risk to their reproductive capacities.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride were evaluated in an open-label, randomized, controlled multicenter trial comparing bendamustine hydrochloride to chlorambucil. The trial was conducted in 301 previously-untreated patients with Binet Stage B or C (Rai Stages I - IV) CLL requiring treatment. Need-to-treat criteria included hematopoietic insufficiency, B-symptoms, rapidly progressive disease or risk of complications from bulky lymphadenopathy. Patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia, Richter’s syndrome, or transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study.</p><p>The patient populations in the bendamustine hydrochloride and chlorambucil treatment groups were balanced with regard to the following baseline characteristics: age (median 63 vs. 66 years), gender (63% vs. 61% male), Binet stage (71% vs. 69% Binet B), lymphadenopathy (79% vs. 82%), enlarged spleen (76% vs. 80%), enlarged liver (48% vs. 46%), hypercellular bone marrow (79% vs. 73%), “B” symptoms (51% vs. 53%), lymphocyte count (mean 65.7x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L vs. 65.1x10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L), and serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration (mean 370.2 vs. 388.4 U/L). Ninety percent of patients in both treatment groups had immuno-phenotypic confirmation of CLL (CD5, CD23 and either CD19 or CD20 or both).</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bendamustine hydrochloride at 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, administered intravenously over a period of 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 or chlorambucil at 0.8 mg/kg (Broca’s normal weight) administered orally on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Efficacy endpoints of objective response rate and progression-free survival were calculated using a pre-specified algorithm based on NCI working group criteria for CLL.</p><p>The results of this open-label randomized study demonstrated a higher rate of overall response and a longer progression-free survival for bendamustine hydrochloride compared to chlorambucil (<span class="Italics">see</span> Table 5). Survival data are not mature.</p><p>Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival comparing bendamustine hydrochloride with chlorambucil are shown in Figure 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1. Progression-Free Survival</span></p><p></p><h3>Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride was evaluated in a single arm study of 100 patients with indolent B-cell NHL that had progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen. Patients were included if they relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab. All patients received bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously at a dose of 120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, on Days 1 and 2 of a 21-day treatment cycle. Patients were treated for up to 8 cycles.</p><p>The median age was 60 years, 65% were male, and 95% had a baseline WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Major tumor subtypes were follicular lymphoma (62%), diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma (21%), and marginal zone lymphoma (16%). Ninety-nine percent of patients had received previous chemotherapy, 91% of patients had received previous alkylator therapy, and 97% of patients had relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose (monotherapy) or last dose (maintenance regimen or combination therapy) of rituximab.</p><p>Efficacy was based on the assessments by a blinded independent review committee (IRC) and included overall response rate (complete response + complete response unconfirmed + partial response) and duration of response (DR) as summarized in Table 6.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>Safe Handling and Disposal</h3><p class="First">Bendamustine Hydrochloride Injection is a cytotoxic drug.
