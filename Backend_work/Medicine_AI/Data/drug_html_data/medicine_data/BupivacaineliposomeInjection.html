It is a local anesthetic that prevents pain by blocking signals at the nerve endings directly at the surgical area or by blocking nerve endings of the brachial plexus (nerves that conduct signals to the shoulder, arm, and hand).</p><p>Bupivacaine liposome is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using bupivacaine liposome</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For bupivacaine liposome, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to bupivacaine liposome or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of bupivacaine liposome injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of bupivacaine liposome injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems, which may require caution for patients receiving bupivacaine liposome injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of bupivacaine liposome</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you bupivacaine liposome in a hospital. It is given through a needle injected into the tissue at the surgical site (eg, foot) or into the nerve endings of the brachial plexus (nerves that conduct signals to the shoulder, arm, and hand).</p><p>Bupivacaine liposome should cause numbness only to the area where it is injected. You may experience temporary loss of sensation or movement to the injected area for up to 5 days. This type of numbing procedure is called local anesthesia. It is not meant to cause you to fall asleep or become unconscious.</p><p>Bupivacaine liposome injection (Exparel®) works differently than other forms of bupivacaine, even at the same dose. You should not receive another type of bupivacaine injection or another anesthetic within 4 days (96 hours) after the injection of Exparel®.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using bupivacaine liposome</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress closely after you receive bupivacaine liposome</i> to see if the medicine is working properly.

It is more likely to occur in patients receiving too much of the medicine, but can also occur with small amounts. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has the following symptoms after receiving bupivacaine liposome: pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nails, confusion, headache, lightheadedness, fast heartbeat, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have the following symptoms with bupivacaine liposome: anxiety, blurred vision, depression, drowsiness, lightheadedness, nausea or vomiting, numbness and tingling of the mouth or lips, restlessness, ringing in the ears, speech problems, or tremors.</p><p>Bupivacaine liposome may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.

Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how bupivacaine liposome affects you.</p><p>Bupivacaine liposome may also increase your risk of having serious heart and blood vessel problems such as a heart attack, heart rhythm changes, or low blood pressure. Check with your doctor if you have chest pain or discomfort, pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck, dizziness, fainting, pounding, slow heartbeat, troubled breathing, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Check with your doctor if you have joint pain, stiffness, or loss of motion of the shoulder.
