Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Do not take by mouth. Scopolamine transdermal is for use only on the skin.</p><p>The scopolamine transdermal skin patch is applied to a hairless area of skin just behind your ear. In some cases, a healthcare provider will apply the patch just before your surgery.</p><p>To prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery, the skin patch is usually applied the evening before surgery. Keep wearing the patch for 24 hours after your surgery, then remove it and throw it away.</p><p>If you use scopolamine transdermal at home, read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Wear only 1 patch at a time. Do not cut or tear the patch.</p><p>To prevent motion sickness, apply the skin patch at least 4 hours before you will be exposed to a situation that may cause motion sickness.</p><p>If the skin patch falls off, replace it with a new one. Limit the amount of time you spend in water (swimming or bathing) or the patch may fall off.</p><p>You may wear the skin patch for up to 3 days. If you need to use  scopolamine transdermal for longer than 3 days, remove the patch and place a new one behind your other ear.</p><p>Always wash your hands with soap and water after handling a scopolamine transdermal skin patch, whether you are applying it or removing it. Also wash the skin behind your ear where the patch was worn. Use soap and water and then dry thoroughly.</p><p>After removing a patch, fold it closed with the sticky side in, and throw it away in a place where pets and children cannot reach it.</p><p>This medicine can affect the results of certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using scopolamine transdermal.</p><p>The scopolamine transdermal patch may burn your skin if you wear the patch during an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Remove the patch before undergoing such a test.</p><p>You may have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when you stop using scopolamine transdermal. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep each patch in its foil wrapper until you are ready to apply a patch.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since scopolamine is used when needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. Skip any missed dose if it's almost time for your next dose. Do not wear more than 1 patch at a time.</p><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you forget to apply the patch as directed before surgery.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose can cause vision problems, severe drowsiness, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, painful or difficult urination, hot or dry skin, fast heartbeats, seizure, or loss of consciousness.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using scopolamine transdermal?</h2><p>Avoid touching your eyes just after applying a scopolamine transdermal skin patch.
