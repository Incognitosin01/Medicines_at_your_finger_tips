Its structural formula is as follows:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">14</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>                                      M.W. 198.22</p><h2>Guiadrine DX - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Dextromethorphan is an antitussive agent which, unlike the isomeric levorphanol, has no analgesic or addictive properties. The drug acts centrally and elevates the threshold for coughing. It is about equal to codeine in depressing the cough reflex. In therapeutic dosage, dextromethorphan does not inhibit ciliary activity. Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized by the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.</p><p>Guaifenesin is an expectorant which increases respiratory tract fluid secretions and helps to loosen phlegm and bronchial secretions. By reducing the viscosity of secretions, guaifenesin increases the efficiency of the cough reflex and of ciliary action in removing accumulated secretions from the trachea and bronchi. Guaifenesin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is readily metabolized and excreted in the urine. Guaifenesin has a plasma half-life of one hour. The major urinary metabolite is β-(2-methoxyphenoxy) lactic acid.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Guiadrine DX</h2><p class="First">For the temporary relief of cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation associated with a cold or inhaled irritants and help loosen phlegm (mucus) and thin bronchial secretions to drain bronchial tubes. This product helps to control the cough reflex that causes coughing.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Guiadrine™ DX is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients. Guiadrine™ DX should not be used in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitor therapy (MAOI) and for 14 days after stopping MAOI therapy.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dosage.</span> Do not take this product for persistent or chronic cough such as occurs with smoking, asthma, emphysema, or where excessive secretions accompany cough, except under the advice and supervision of a physician.</p><p>A persistent cough may be a sign of a serious condition. If cough persists for more than 1 week, tends to recur, or is accompanied by a fever, rash, or persistent headache, consult a doctor.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Before prescribing medication to suppress or modify cough, it is important that the underlying cause of cough is identified, that modification of cough does not increase the risk of clinical or physiological complications, and that appropriate therapy for the primary disease is instituted.</p><p>Dextromethorphan should be used with caution in sedated or debilitated patients, and in patients to be confined to the supine position.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Do not use this product if you are now taking a prescription monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI certain drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease) or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug. If you are uncertain whether your prescription drug contains an MAOI, consult a health professional before taking this product.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Guaifenesin may increase renal clearance for the urate and thereby lower serum uric acid levels. Guaifenesin may produce an increase in urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and may therefore interfere with the interpretation of this test for the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. It may also falsely elevate the VMA test for catechols. Administration of this drug should be discontinued 48 hours prior to the collection of urine specimens for such tests.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No data is available on the long-term potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility in animals or humans.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is not known whether this medication can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Therefore, Guiadrine™ DX Liquid should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the possible risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Guiadrine™ DX Liquid is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this drug is administered to a nursing woman and a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population, under 12, have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide: occasionally causes slight drowsiness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal disturbances.</p><p>Guaifenesin: Nausea and vomiting are the most frequently occurring side effects.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage with dextromethorphan may produce central excitement and mental confusion. Very high doses may produce respiratory depression.</p><p>Overdosage with guaifenesin is unlikely to produce toxic effects since its toxicity is low.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p class="First">In severe cases of overdosage, treatment should be aimed at reducing further absorption of the drug. Gastric emptying (Syrup of Ipecac) and/or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion.</p><h2>Guiadrine DX Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Adults and Children 12 years of age or older</h3><p class="First">1 teaspoonful (5 mL) every 4 hours, not to exceed 6 teaspoonfuls in 24 hours.</p><p>This product is not indicated for use in children under 12 years of age.
