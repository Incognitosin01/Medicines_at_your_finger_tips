</ul><h2>Capsules</h2><p class="First">Iron 106 mg, Sodium Ascorbate 200 mg, Thiamine 10 mg, Riboflavin 6 mg, Pyridoxine 5 mg, Folic Acid 1 mg, Cyanocobalamin 15 mcg, Niacinamide 30 mg, Pantothenic Acid 10 mg, Zinc 18.2 mg, Magnesium 6.9 mg</p><p>A medical food, for use only under the direction and supervision of a licensed physician.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RX only</span></p><h2>Centratex Description</h2><h3>Active Ingredients (Each capsule)</h3><h3>Inactive Ingredients</h3><p class="First">Microcrystalline Cellulose, Silica, Magnesium Stearate, Gelatin Capsule</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">For the treatment of anemia due to lack of iron and low folate as in menorrhagia, pregnancy, puberty, excessive blood loss, and advanced age. Also for treatment of conditions where iron and vitamin C deficiency occur together, along with a poor intake or increased need for B-complex vitamins in chronic and acute illness, as well as cases of metabolic stress, and in periods of extended recovery.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Centratex is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients. Iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, and hemolytic anemias. Folic acid may obscure signs and symptoms of pernicious anemia and is therefore a contraindication as well.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. Iron is toxic and has been shown to cause severe reactions in children including death.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B-12 is deficient.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg – 0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><h3>PEDIATRIC USE</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><h3>GERIATRIC USE</h3><p class="First">No clinical studies have been performed in patients over 65 to determine whether older persons respond differently from younger persons. Physicians should consider that elderly persons may have decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTION</h2><p class="First">Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and subside with continuation of therapy and physician encouragement. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, occasional G.I. disturbances may be controlled by giving Centratex shortly after meals.</p><h2>Centratex Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Adults only: 1 capsule daily between meals, orally. Not recommended in children.</p><h2>How is Centratex Supplied</h2><p class="First">Centratex is supplied as a natural gelatin capsule with tan speckled powder.
