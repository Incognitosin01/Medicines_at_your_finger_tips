</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Coumadin Injection</h2><p class="First">COUMADIN<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for:</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>COUMADIN has no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor does it reverse ischemic tissue damage. Once a thrombus has occurred, however, the goals of anticoagulant treatment are to prevent further extension of the formed clot and to prevent secondary thromboembolic complications that may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae.</p><h2>Coumadin Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Individualized Dosing</h3><p class="First">The dosage and administration of COUMADIN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient’s INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient’s INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.</p><h3>Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.</span></p><p class="First">Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0-3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:</p><p class="First">In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0-3.0).</p><p class="First">Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin has not been fully evaluated by clinical trials in patients with valvular disease associated with AF, patients with mitral stenosis, and patients with recurrent systemic embolism of unknown etiology. However, a moderate dose regimen (INR 2.0-3.0) may be used for these patients.</p><h3>Initial and Maintenance Dosing</h3><p class="First">The appropriate initial dosing of COUMADIN varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by:</p><p>Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.</p><p>Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><p class="First">If the patient’s CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of COUMADIN is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient’s dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily.</p><p class="First">Table 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance COUMADIN doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)</span>]. If the patient’s CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/*3, *2/*2, *2/*3, and *3/*3 may require more prolonged time (&gt;2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants.</p><p class="First">VKORC1</p><p class="First">CYP2C9</p><p class="First">*1/*1</p><p class="First">*1/*2</p><p class="First">*1/*3</p><p class="First">*2/*2</p><p class="First">*2/*3</p><p class="First">*3/*3</p><p class="First">GG</p><p class="First">5-7 mg</p><p class="First">5-7 mg</p><p class="First">3-4 mg</p><p class="First">3-4 mg</p><p class="First">3-4 mg</p><p class="First">0.5-2 mg</p><p class="First">AG</p><p class="First">5-7 mg</p><p class="First">3-4 mg</p><p class="First">3-4 mg</p><p class="First">3-4 mg</p><p class="First">0.5-2 mg</p><p class="First">0.5-2 mg</p><p class="First">AA</p><p class="First">3-4 mg</p><p class="First">3-4 mg</p><p class="First">0.5-2 mg</p><p class="First">0.5-2 mg</p><p class="First">0.5-2 mg</p><p class="First">0.5-2 mg</p><h3>Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation</h3><p class="First">COUMADIN has a narrow therapeutic range (index), and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during COUMADIN therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with COUMADIN, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.8)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of COUMADIN therapy.</p><h3>Missed Dose</h3><p class="First">The anticoagulant effect of COUMADIN persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of COUMADIN at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.</p><h3>Intravenous Route of Administration</h3><p class="First">The intravenous dose of COUMADIN is the same as the oral dose. After reconstitution, administer COUMADIN for injection as a slow bolus injection into a peripheral vein over 1 to 2 minutes. COUMADIN for injection is not recommended for intramuscular administration.</p><p>Reconstitute the vial with 2.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The resulting yield is 2.5 mL of a 2 mg per mL solution (5 mg total). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is noted.</p><p>After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection is stable for 4 hours at room temperature. It does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and, thus, care must be taken to assure the sterility of the prepared solution. The vial is for single use only, discard any unused solution.</p><h3>Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery</h3><p class="First">Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of COUMADIN therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing COUMADIN even for a short period of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of COUMADIN to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation.</p><h3>Conversion From Other Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Since the full anticoagulant effect of COUMADIN is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with COUMADIN, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to COUMADIN may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap COUMADIN therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until COUMADIN has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued.</p><p>As heparin may affect the INR, patients receiving both heparin and COUMADIN should have INR monitoring at least:</p><p>COUMADIN may increase the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin. A severe elevation (&gt;50 seconds) in aPTT with an INR in the desired range has been identified as an indication of increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage.</p><p class="First">Consult the labeling of other anticoagulants for instructions on conversion to COUMADIN.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tablets</p><p class="First">Strength</p><p class="First">Color</p><p class="First">Superimposed Imprint</p><p class="First">1 mg</p><p class="First">Pink</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">2 mg</p><p class="First">Lavender</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">2.5 mg</p><p class="First">Green</p><p class="First">2-1/2</p><p class="First">3 mg</p><p class="First">Tan</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">4 mg</p><p class="First">Blue</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">5 mg</p><p class="First">Peach</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">6 mg</p><p class="First">Teal</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">7.5 mg</p><p class="First">Yellow</p><p class="First">7-1/2</p><p class="First">10 mg</p><p class="First">White (dye-free)</p><p class="First">10</p><p>For Injection</p><p>For injection: 5 mg, lyophilized powder in a single-dose vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">COUMADIN is contraindicated in:</p><p>COUMADIN is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of thromboembolism <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>. COUMADIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. COUMADIN exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If COUMADIN is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>COUMADIN is contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hemorrhage</h3><p class="First">COUMADIN can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR &gt;4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)</span>], certain concomitant drugs [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>], and long duration of warfarin therapy.</p><p>Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding.</p><p>Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with COUMADIN therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>].</p><h3>Tissue Necrosis</h3><p class="First">Necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues is an uncommon but serious risk (&lt;0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of COUMADIN therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported.</p><p>Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue COUMADIN therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.</p><h3>Calciphylaxis</h3><p class="First">Fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic arteriolopathy has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue COUMADIN and treat calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy.</p><h3>Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli</h3><p class="First">Anticoagulation therapy with COUMADIN may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “purple toes syndrome.” Discontinue COUMADIN therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.</p><h3>Limb Ischemia, Necrosis, and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS</h3><p class="First">Do not use COUMADIN as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with COUMADIN may be considered after the platelet count has normalized.</p><h3>Use in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves</h3><p class="First">COUMADIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. While COUMADIN is contraindicated during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using COUMADIN may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue COUMADIN should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient’s medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. COUMADIN exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks</h3><p class="First">In the following clinical settings, the risks of COUMADIN therapy may be increased:</p><h3>Endogenous Factors Affecting INR</h3><p class="First">The following factors may be responsible for <span class="Bold">increased</span> INR response: diarrhea, hepatic disorders, poor nutritional state, steatorrhea, or vitamin K deficiency.</p><p>The following factors may be responsible for <span class="Bold">decreased</span> INR response: increased vitamin K intake or hereditary warfarin resistance.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions to COUMADIN are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><p>Other adverse reactions to COUMADIN include:</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Drugs may interact with COUMADIN through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with COUMADIN are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with COUMADIN are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism.</p><p>More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [see <span class="Italics">Boxed Warning</span>].</p><p>Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with COUMADIN or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding.</p><h3>CYP450 Interactions</h3><p class="First">CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin <span class="Italics">S</span>-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the <span class="Italics">R</span>-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4.</p><p>Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer.</p><p class="First">CYP2C9</p><p class="First">amiodarone, capecitabine, cotrimoxazole, etravirine, fluconazole, fluvastatin, fluvoxamine, metronidazole, miconazole, oxandrolone, sulfinpyrazone, tigecycline, voriconazole, zafirlukast</p><p class="First">aprepitant, bosentan, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin</p><p class="First">CYP1A2</p><p class="First">acyclovir, allopurinol, caffeine, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, disulfiram, enoxacin, famotidine, fluvoxamine, methoxsalen, mexiletine, norfloxacin, oral contraceptives, phenylpropanolamine, propafenone, propranolol, terbinafine, thiabendazole, ticlopidine, verapamil, zileuton</p><p class="First">montelukast, moricizine, omeprazole, phenobarbital, phenytoin, cigarette smoking</p><p class="First">CYP3A4</p><p class="First">alprazolam, amiodarone, amlodipine, amprenavir, aprepitant, atorvastatin, atazanavir, bicalutamide, cilostazol, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, conivaptan, cyclosporine, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, fosamprenavir, imatinib, indinavir, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, nilotinib, oral contraceptives, posaconazole, ranitidine, ranolazine, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, tipranavir, voriconazole, zileuton</p><p class="First">armodafinil, amprenavir, aprepitant, bosentan, carbamazepine, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin, phenytoin, pioglitazone, prednisone, rifampin, rufinamide</p><h3>Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk</h3><p class="First">Examples of drugs known to increase the risk of bleeding are presented in Table 3. Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin.</p><p class="First">Anticoagulants</p><p class="First">argatroban, dabigatran, bivalirudin, desirudin, heparin, lepirudin</p><p class="First">Antiplatelet Agents</p><p class="First">aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, prasugrel, ticlopidine</p><p class="First">Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents</p><p class="First">celecoxib, diclofenac, diflunisal, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, mefenamic acid, naproxen, oxaprozin, piroxicam, sulindac</p><p class="First">Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors</p><p class="First">citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, milnacipran, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, vilazodone</p><h3>Antibiotics and Antifungals</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin.</p><p>Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin.</p><h3>Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods</h3><p class="First">More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals.</p><p>Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and COUMADIN exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation.</p><p>Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g., garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of COUMADIN. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of COUMADIN (e.g., co-enzyme Q<span class="Sub">10</span>, St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with COUMADIN through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort).</p><p>The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with COUMADIN. Advise patients taking COUMADIN to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking COUMADIN should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">COUMADIN is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of thromboembolism, and for whom the benefits of COUMADIN may outweigh the risks <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>. COUMADIN can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Consider the benefits and risks of COUMADIN and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing COUMADIN to a pregnant woman.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First">In humans, warfarin crosses the placenta, and concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) and growth retardation (including low birth weight). Central nervous system and eye abnormalities have also been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker malformation, midline cerebellar atrophy, and ventral midline dysplasia characterized by optic atrophy. Mental retardation, blindness, schizencephaly, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported following warfarin exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary</p><p>Warfarin was not present in human milk from mothers treated with warfarin from a limited published study. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including bleeding in a breastfed infant, consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother’s clinical need for COUMADIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from COUMADIN or from the underlying maternal condition before prescribing COUMADIN to a lactating woman.</p><p class="First">Monitor breastfeeding infants for bruising or bleeding.</p><p class="First">Based on published data in 15 nursing mothers, warfarin was not detected in human milk. Among the 15 full-term newborns, 6 nursing infants had documented prothrombin times within the expected range. Prothrombin times were not obtained for the other 9 nursing infants. Effects in premature infants have not been evaluated.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">COUMADIN can cause fetal harm <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating COUMADIN therapy.</p><p class="First">Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the final dose of COUMADIN.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Adequate and well-controlled studies with COUMADIN have not been conducted in any pediatric population, and the optimum dosing, safety, and efficacy in pediatric patients is unknown. Pediatric use of COUMADIN is based on adult data and recommendations, and available limited pediatric data from observational studies and patient registries. Pediatric patients administered COUMADIN should avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury.</p><p>The developing hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants. Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended. Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries.</p><p>Infants and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition, including infant formulas, may be resistant to warfarin therapy, while human milk-fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis, 1885 patients (24.4%) were 65 years and older, while 185 patients (2.4%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. COUMADIN is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with senility. Observe caution with administration of COUMADIN to elderly patients in any situation or with any physical condition where added risk of hemorrhage is present. Consider lower initiation and maintenance doses of COUMADIN in elderly patients [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Renal clearance is considered to be a minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Hepatic impairment can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin. Use caution when using COUMADIN in these patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p class="First">The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of COUMADIN anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing COUMADIN therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K<span class="Sub">1</span>.</p><p>The use of vitamin K<span class="Sub">1</span> reduces response to subsequent COUMADIN therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of COUMADIN administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.</p><p>Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of COUMADIN is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to COUMADIN overdosage.</p><h2>Coumadin Injection Description</h2><p class="First">COUMADIN (warfarin sodium) tablets and COUMADIN (warfarin sodium) for injection contain warfarin sodium, an anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting vitamin K‑dependent coagulation factors. The chemical name of warfarin sodium is 3-(α-acetonylbenzyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin sodium salt, which is a racemic mixture of the <span class="Italics">R</span>- and <span class="Italics">S</span>-enantiomers. Crystalline warfarin sodium is an isopropanol clathrate. Its empirical formula is C19H15NaO4, and its structural formula is represented by the following:</p><p>Crystalline warfarin sodium occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder that is discolored by light. It is very soluble in water, freely soluble in alcohol, and very slightly soluble in chloroform and ether.</p><p>COUMADIN tablets for oral use also contain:</p><p class="First">All strengths:</p><p class="First">Lactose, starch, and magnesium stearate</p><p class="First">1 mg:</p><p class="First">D&amp;C Red No. 6 Barium Lake</p><p class="First">2 mg:</p><p class="First">FD&amp;C Blue No. 2 Aluminum Lake and<br/>

Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin K promotes the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins that are essential for biological activity. Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K<span class="Sub">1</span> epoxide [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)</span>].</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration. However, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of COUMADIN may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. This is consistent with the half-lives of the affected vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins: Factor II - 60 hours, VII - 4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, X - 48 to 72 hours, and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">COUMADIN is a racemic mixture of the <span class="Italics">R</span>- and <span class="Italics">S</span>-enantiomers of warfarin. The <span class="Italics">S</span>-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the <span class="Italics">R</span>-enantiomer in humans, but generally has a more rapid clearance.</p><p class="First">Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours.</p><p class="First">Warfarin distributes into a relatively small apparent volume of distribution of about 0.14 L/kg. A distribution phase lasting 6 to 12 hours is distinguishable after rapid intravenous or oral administration of an aqueous solution. Approximately 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.</p><p class="First">The elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by metabolism. Warfarin is stereoselectively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) microsomal enzymes to inactive hydroxylated metabolites (predominant route) and by reductases to reduced metabolites (warfarin alcohols) with minimal anticoagulant activity. Identified metabolites of warfarin include dehydrowarfarin, two diastereoisomer alcohols, and 4′-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 10-hydroxywarfarin. The CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme, is likely to be the principal form of human liver CYP450 that modulates the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> anticoagulant activity of warfarin. Patients with one or more variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased S-warfarin clearance [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)</span>].</p><p class="First">The terminal half-life of warfarin after a single dose is approximately 1 week; however, the effective half-life ranges from 20 to 60 hours, with a mean of about 40 hours. The clearance of R-warfarin is generally half that of S-warfarin, thus as the volumes of distribution are similar, the half-life of R-warfarin is longer than that of S-warfarin. The half-life of R-warfarin ranges from 37 to 89 hours, while that of S-warfarin ranges from 21 to 43 hours. Studies with radiolabeled drug have demonstrated that up to 92% of the orally administered dose is recovered in urine. Very little warfarin is excreted unchanged in urine. Urinary excretion is in the form of metabolites.</p><p class="First">Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. The cause of the increased sensitivity to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in this age group is unknown but may be due to a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. Limited information suggests there is no difference in the clearance of S-warfarin; however, there may be a slight decrease in the clearance of R-warfarin in the elderly as compared to the young. Therefore, as patient age increases, a lower dose of warfarin is usually required to produce a therapeutic level of anticoagulation [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)</span>].</p><p class="First">Asian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. A non-controlled study of 151 Chinese outpatients stabilized on warfarin for various indications reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.3 ± 1.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5. Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in these patients, with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age.</p><h3>Pharmacogenomics</h3><p class="First">The <span class="Italics">S</span>-enantiomer of warfarin is mainly metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme. The variant alleles, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, result in decreased <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> CYP2C9 enzymatic 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin. The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively.</p><p>Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower frequencies, including *5, *6, and *11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and *5, *9, and *11 alleles in Caucasians.</p><p>Warfarin reduces the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle through inhibition of VKOR, a multiprotein enzyme complex. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene (e.g., –1639G&gt;A) have been associated with variable warfarin dose requirements. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene variants generally explain the largest proportion of known variability in warfarin dose requirements.</p><p>CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information, when available, can assist in selection of the initial dose of warfarin [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or fertility studies have not been performed with warfarin.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Atrial Fibrillation</h3><p class="First">In five prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving 3711 patients with non-rheumatic AF, warfarin significantly reduced the risk of systemic thromboembolism including stroke (see Table 4).
