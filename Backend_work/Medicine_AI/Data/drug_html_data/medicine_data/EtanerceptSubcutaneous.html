Etanercept may also slow the progression of damage to the body from active arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to treat a condition known as ankylosing spondylitis.</p><p>Etanercept is also used in children 2 years of age and older for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It is also used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients 4 years of age and older.</p><p>Etanercept is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using etanercept</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For etanercept, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to etanercept or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of etanercept injection in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis younger than 2 years of age and in children with psoriasis younger than 4 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of etanercept injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have infections, which may require caution in patients receiving etanercept injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking etanercept, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using etanercept with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of etanercept</h2><p>Etanercept is given as a shot under your skin. Etanercept may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital. If you or your child are using etanercept at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how to use the medicine.</p><p>Etanercept comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>If you use etanercept at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself or your child a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems.</p><p>Etanercept is available in 4 forms. You may use a prefilled <i>Enbrel Mini™ cartridge</i> through the <i>AutoTouch™ reusable autoinjector</i>, a <i>prefilled syringe</i>, a prefilled <i>SureClick™ autoinjector</i>, or a <i>vial</i> (glass container).</p><p>The needle cover on the prefilled syringe, SureClick™ autoinjector, and Enbrel Mini™ cartridge contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you or your child have a latex allergy before you start using etanercept.</p><p>To use the <i>autoinjector or syringe</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using etanercept.</li>
<li>Remove the carton with the syringe or autoinjector from the refrigerator and place it on a clean cloth.</li>
<li>Allow 30 minutes for the syringe or autoinjector to warm up to room temperature.</li>
<li>Do not remove the needle cover on the prefilled syringe or the autoinjector cap while allowing the medicine to reach room temperature. Remove these immediately before use.</li>
<li>Check the liquid in the syringe or autoinjector. It should be clear and colorless, and may have small white particles. If it is cloudy, discolored, or has large particles, do not use it.</li>
<li>Check that the amount of liquid in the prefilled syringe falls between the two purple fill level indicator lines on the syringe. If the syringe does not have the right amount of liquid, do not use it.</li>
<li>If the liquid is clear, place it on a clean, flat surface. Do not shake the medicine.</li>
<li>Choose an injection site on your body (eg, thigh, abdomen or stomach area, or upper arm). Clean the injection site with a fresh alcohol wipe and let it dry.</li>
<li>Remove the cap or needle cover when you are ready to inject.</li>
<li>Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, or hard.</li>
<li>Throw away used needles in a hard, closed container (puncture-resistant) that the needles cannot poke through. Keep this container away from children and pets.</li>

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Your body's ability to fight infection may be reduced while you are being treated with etanercept. It is very important that you call your doctor at the first signs of any infection. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have any of the following symptoms while using etanercept: fever, chills, cough or hoarseness, flu-like symptoms, lower back or side pain, painful or difficult urination, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>While you are being treated with etanercept, <i>do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval</i>. Your child's vaccines need to be current before he or she begins using etanercept. Be sure to ask your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.</p><p>Etanercept may cause serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive the medicine.</p><p>You or your child will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using etanercept. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>Etanercept may increase your risk of having a lupus-like syndrome or autoimmune hepatitis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a fever or chills, a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or weakness, light-colored stools, nausea, vomiting, upper right-sided abdominal or stomach pain, or yellow eyes and skin.</p><p>Serious skin reactions can occur during treatment with etanercept.
