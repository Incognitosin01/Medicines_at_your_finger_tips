(340.2 g) of Histostat 50 equivalent to 0.01875% nitarsone. Start Histostat 50 medication depending on such factors as record of blackhead occurrence on the farm or in the area; climate and weather; and soil or litter condition. Continue as long as prevention is desired.</p><h3>Chickens</h3><p class="First">Mix in feed so that 2,000 lbs (909 kg) of complete ration contain 12 oz. (340.2 g) of Histostat 50 equivalent to 0.01875% nitarsone. Give continuously for at least 3 weeks during periods of stress. Long-term medication is not necessary for chickens because of their natural resistance except at times of undue stress. Reduced feed consumption, onset of production, and errors in management may produce stresses which lower the resistance of chickens to blackhead.</p><h3>Mixing directions</h3><p class="First">To secure an even distribution, mix Histostat 50 with a small amount of feed ingredients, then add the remainder of the ingredients and mix thoroughly.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Early medication is essential to prevent spread of the disease. Adequate drinking water must be provided near feeders at all times. The drug is not effective in preventing blackhead in birds infected more than 4 or 5 days. Symptoms of blackhead do not appear until 10 to 15 days after birds become infected.</p><h2>Caution</h2><p class="First">Use as the sole source of arsenic.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Keep out of reach of children. Overdosage or lack of water may result in leg weakness or paralysis. Discontinue use 5 days before slaughtering for human consumption to allow for elimination of the drug from edible tissue. In mixing, avoid inhaling dust. Avoid contact of product with skin, eyes and clothing. Wash thoroughly after handling.
