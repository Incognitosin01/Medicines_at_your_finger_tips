<li>Potassium Phosphates Injection is for <span class="Italics">intravenous infusion</span> into a peripheral or central vein <span class="Italics">only after dilution and admixing</span>.</li>
<li>Potassium Phosphates Injection is to be prepared only in a suitable work area such as a laminar flow hood (or an equivalent clean air compounding area). The key factor in the preparation is careful aseptic technique to avoid inadvertent touch contamination during mixing of solutions and addition of other nutrients.</li>
<li>Transfer the required amount of Potassium Phosphates Injection to the parenteral nutrition solution following the admixture of amino acids, dextrose, electrolytes solutions, and prior to lipids (if added).</li>
<li>Because additives may be incompatible, evaluate all additions to the parenteral nutrition container for compatibility and stability of the resulting preparation.</li>
<li>Calcium and phosphate ratios must be considered. Excess addition of calcium and phosphate, especially in the form of mineral salts, may result in the formation of calcium-phosphate precipitates <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Calcium-phosphate stability in parenteral nutrition solutions is dependent upon the pH of the solution, temperature, and relative concentration of each ion. Discard if any precipitates are observed.</li>
<li>Inspect the final parenteral solution containing Potassium Phosphates Injection to ensure that:
<ul class="Circle">
<li>precipitates have not formed during mixing or addition of additives and inspect again before administration.</li>
<li>the emulsion has not separated, if lipids have been added. Separation of the emulsion can be visibly identified by a yellowish streaking or the accumulation of yellowish droplets in the admixed emulsion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The final parenteral nutrition solution is for intravenous infusion into a peripheral or central vein. The choice of a peripheral or central venous route should depend on the osmolarity of the final infusate. Solutions with osmolarity of 900 mOsmol/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</li>

<li>hypercalcemia or significant hypocalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Warning and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Cardiac Adverse Reactions with Undiluted, Bolus or Rapid Intravenous Administration</h3><p class="First">Intravenous administration of potassium phosphates to correct hypophosphatemia in single doses of phosphorus 50 mmol and greater and/or at rapid infusion rates (over 1 to 3 hours) in intravenous fluids has resulted in death, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmia (including QT prolongation), hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and seizures <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)].</span> In addition, inappropriate intravenous administration of undiluted or insufficiently diluted potassium phosphates as a rapid “IV push” has resulted in cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and death.</p><p>Potassium Phosphates Injection is for <span class="Italics">intravenous infusion only after dilution or admixing</span>. The maximum initial or single dose of Potassium Phosphates Injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq). The recommended infusion rate for administration through a peripheral venous catheter is approximately phosphorus 6.8 mmol/hour (potassium 10 mEq/hour). Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Pulmonary Embolism due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary vascular emboli and pulmonary distress related to precipitates in the pulmonary vasculature have been described in patients receiving admixed products containing calcium and phosphate or parenteral nutrition. The cause of precipitate formation has not been determined in all cases; however, in some fatal cases, pulmonary emboli occurred as a result of calcium phosphate precipitates. Precipitation has occurred following passage through an in-line filter; <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> precipitate formation may also have occurred. If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the parenteral nutrition infusion and initiate a medical evaluation. In addition to inspection of the solution <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>, the infusion set and catheter should also periodically be checked for precipitates.</p><h3>Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First">Potassium Phosphates Injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, including life-threatening cardiac events, especially when administered in excessive doses, undiluted or by rapid intravenous infusion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease are at increased risk of developing life-threatening hyperkalemia, when administered intravenous potassium <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Other patients at increased risk of hyperkalemia include those with severe adrenal insufficiency or treated concurrently with other drugs that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. Patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia.</p><p>Consider the amount of potassium from all sources when determining the dose of Potassium Phosphates Injection and do not exceed the maximum age-appropriate recommended daily amount of potassium. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> to &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), start at the low end of the dose range and monitor serum potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>When administering Potassium Phosphates Injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia, check the serum potassium concentration prior to administration. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, do not administer Potassium Phosphates Injection and use an alternative source of phosphorus <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p>The maximum initial or single dose of Potassium Phosphates Injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq). The recommended infusion rate of potassium through a peripheral venous catheter is 10 mEq/hour. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates of potassium <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Hyperphosphatemia and Hypocalcemia</h3><p class="First">Hyperphosphatemia can occur with intravenous administration of potassium phosphates, especially in patients with renal impairment. Hyperphosphatemia can cause the formation of insoluble calcium phosphorus products with consequent hypocalcemia, neurological irritability with tetany, nephrocalcinosis with acute kidney injury and more rarely, cardiac irritability with arrhythmias.</p><p>Obtain serum calcium concentrations prior to administration and normalize the calcium before administering Potassium Phosphates Injection. Potassium Phosphates Injection is contraindicated in patients with hyperphosphatemia and/or hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>Monitor serum phosphorus and calcium concentrations during treatment with Potassium Phosphates Injection <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Aluminum Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Potassium Phosphates Injection contains aluminum that may be toxic.</p><p>Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Preterm infants are particularly at risk for aluminum toxicity because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate containing solutions, which also contain aluminum.</p><p>Patients with renal impairment, including preterm infants, who receive greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day of parenteral aluminum can accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.</p><p>Exposure to aluminum from Potassium Phosphates Injection is not more than 1.4 mcg/kg/day when patients are administered the recommended dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Description (11)]</span>.</p><p>When prescribing Potassium Phosphates Injection for use in parenteral nutrition solutions containing other small volume parenteral products, the total daily patient exposure to aluminum from the admixture should be considered and maintained at no more than 5 mcg/kg/day <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Intravenous infusion of phosphate has been reported to cause a decrease in serum magnesium (and calcium) concentrations when administered to patients with hypercalcemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Monitor serum magnesium concentrations during treatment.</p><h3>Vein Damage and Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Potassium Phosphates Injection must be diluted and administered in intravenous fluids or used as an admixture in parenteral nutrition. It is not for direct intravenous infusion. The infusion of hypertonic solutions into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage, and/or thrombosis. The primary complication of peripheral administration is venous thrombophlebitis, which manifests as pain, erythema, tenderness or a palpable cord. Remove the catheter as soon as possible and initiate appropriate medical treatment if thrombophlebitis develops.</p><p>When administered peripherally in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia, a generally recommended maximum concentration is phosphorus 6.8 mmol/100 mL (potassium 10 mEq/100 mL) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span></p><p>Parenteral nutrition solutions with an osmolarity of 900 mOsmol/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentrations during treatment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Aluminum Toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></li>
<li>Hypomagnesemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
<li>Vein Damage and Thrombosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span></li>
</ul><p>The following adverse reactions in Table 5 have been reported in clinical studies or postmarketing reports in patients receiving intravenously administered potassium phosphates. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Other Products that Increase Serum Potassium</h3><p class="First">Administration of Potassium Phosphates Injection to patients treated concurrently or recently with products that increase serum potassium (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, digoxin, or the immunosuppressants tacrolimus and cyclosporine) increases the risk of severe and potentially fatal hyperkalemia, in particular in the presence of other risk factors for hyperkalemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>. Avoid use of Potassium Phosphates Injection in patients receiving such products. If use cannot be avoided, closely monitor serum potassium concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)]</span>.</p><h2>USES IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Administration of the recommended dose of Potassium Phosphates Injection is not expected to cause major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Potassium Phosphates Injection.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Phosphorus is an essential mineral element. Parenteral supplementation with potassium phosphates should be considered if a pregnant woman's requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Phosphorus and potassium are present in human milk. Administration of the recommended dose of Potassium Phosphates Injection is not expected to cause harm to a breastfed infant. There is no information on the effects of potassium phosphates on milk production. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Potassium Phosphates Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Potassium Phosphates Injection or from underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Potassium Phosphates Injection have been established in pediatric patients as a source of phosphorus:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia when oral or enteral replacement is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated.</li>
<li>for parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated.</li>
</ul><p>Because of immature renal function, preterm infants receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition treatment with Potassium Phosphates Injection may be at higher risk of aluminum toxicity. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In general, dose selection of Potassium Phosphates Injection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the low end of the dosing range because of the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. It may be useful to monitor renal function during treatment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Potassium and phosphorus are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of adverse reactions to Potassium Phosphates Injection may be greater in patients with impaired renal function <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5)]</span>.</p><p>Potassium Phosphates Injection is contraindicated due to the risk of hyperkalemia in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) or end stage renal disease <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> to &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), start at the low end of the dosage range and monitor serum potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hyperphosphatemia</span></p><p>Administration of excessive doses of intravenous potassium phosphates in intravenous fluids as a single dose ranging from approximately 50 to 270 mmol phosphorus and/or at rapid infusion rates (over 1 to 3 hours) has resulted in death, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmia (including QT prolongation), hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, seizures, and tetany.</p><p>Hyperphosphatemia is particularly a risk in patients with renal failure. Hyperphosphatemia leads in turn to hypocalcemia, which may be severe, and to ectopic calcification, particularly in patients with initial hypercalcemia. Tissue calcification may cause hypotension and organ damage and result in acute renal failure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Excessive administration of phosphates given as potassium salts may also cause hyperkalemia.
