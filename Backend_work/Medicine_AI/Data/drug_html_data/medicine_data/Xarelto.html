Blood clots may also develop after knee or hip replacement surgery.</p><p>Xarelto is sometimes used to lower your risk of a DVT or PE coming back after you have received treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.</p><p>Xarelto is used in people with atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disorder) to lower the risk of stroke caused by a blood clot.</p><p>Xarelto is used to help prevent blood clots in certain people hospitalized for an acute illness who are at risk of getting blood clots and who do not have a high risk of bleeding.</p><p>Xarelto is also given together with aspirin to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other serious heart problems in people with coronary artery disease (decreased blood flow to the heart) or peripheral artery disease (decreased blood flow to the legs).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not stop taking Xarelto without first talking to your doctor.
