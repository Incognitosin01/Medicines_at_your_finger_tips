Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF Powder for Oral Solution is a synthetic polyglycol having an average molecular weight of 3350. The actual molecular weight is not less than 90.0 percent and not greater than 110.0 percent of the nominal value. The chemical formula is HO(C2H4O)nH in which n represents the average number of oxyethylene groups. Below 55°C, it is a free flowing white powder freely soluble in water. Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF is an osmotic agent for the treatment of constipation.</p><h2>Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF PEGYLAX - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF is an osmotic agent which causes water to be retained with the stool. Essentially, complete recovery of Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF was shown in normal subjects without constipation. Attempts at recovery of Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF in constipated patients resulted in incomplete and highly variable recovery. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> study showed indirectly that Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF was not fermented into hydrogen or methane by the colonic microflora in human feces. Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF appears to have no effect on the active absorption or secretion of glucose or electrolytes. There is no evidence of tachyphylaxis.</p><h2>Clinical Trials</h2><p class="First">In one study, patients with less than 3 bowel movements per week were randomized to Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF, 17 grams, or placebo for 14 days. An increase in bowel movement frequency was observed for both treatment groups during the first week of treatment. Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF was statistically superior to placebo during the second week of treatment.</p><p>In another study, patients with 3 bowel movements or less per week and/or less than 300 grams of stool per week were randomized to 2 dose levels of Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF or placebo for 10 days each. Success was defined by an increase in both bowel movement frequency and daily stool weight. For both parameters, superiority of the 17 gram dose of Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF over placebo was demonstrated.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF PEGYLAX</h2><p class="First">For the treatment of occasional constipation. This product should be used for 2 weeks or less or as directed by a physician.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected bowel obstruction and patients known to be allergic to polyethylene glycol.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Patients with symptoms suggestive of bowel obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or distention) should be evaluated to rule out this condition before initiating Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF therapy.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Patients presenting with complaints of constipation should have a thorough medical history and physical examination to detect associated metabolic, endocrine and neurogenic conditions, and medications. A diagnostic evaluation should include a structural examination of the colon. Patients should be educated about good defecatory and eating habits (such as high fiber diets) and lifestyle changes (adequate dietary fiber and fluid intake, regular exercise) which may produce more regular bowel habits.</p><p>Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF should be administered after being dissolved in approximately 4 - 8 ounces of water, juice, soda, coffee, or tea.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF softens the stool and increases the frequency of bowel movements by retaining water in the stool. It should always be taken by mouth after being dissolved in 4 - 8 ounces of water, juice, soda, coffee, or tea. Should unusual cramps, bloating, or diarrhea occur, consult your physician.</p><p>Two to 4 days may be required to produce a bowel movement. This product should be used for 2 weeks or less or as directed by a physician.

It is also not known whether Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, or can affect reproductive capacity. Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF should only be administered to a pregnant woman if clearly needed.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">There is no evidence for special considerations when Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF is administered to elderly patients.</p><p>In geriatric nursing home patients, a higher incidence of diarrhea occurred at the recommended 17 gram dose. If diarrhea occurs, Polyethylene Glycol 3350, NF should be discontinued.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Nausea, abdominal bloating, cramping and flatulence may occur. High doses may produce diarrhea and excessive stool frequency, particularly in elderly nursing home patients.</p><p>Patients taking other medications containing polyethylene glycol have occasionally developed urticaria suggestive of an allergic reaction.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of accidental overdosage.
