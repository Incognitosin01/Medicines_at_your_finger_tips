Studies have demonstrated an increased risk of DVT, pulmonary embolism, stroke and myocardial infarction in postmenopausal women during treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens combined with medroxyPROGESTERone acetate, relative to placebo. Studies have also demonstrated estrogen plus progestin increases risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women. An increased risk of invasive breast cancer has also been found in studies. In the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of estrogens and progestins, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins. Progestins with estrogens should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
