Pioglitazone works by helping your body use insulin better. Glimepiride stimulates the release of insulin from the pancreas which will help your body turn food into energy.</p><p>Pioglitazone and glimepiride is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using pioglitazone and glimepiride</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For pioglitazone and glimepiride, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to pioglitazone and glimepiride or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of pioglitazone and glimepiride combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pioglitazone and glimepiride combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have hypoglycemia and age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving pioglitazone and glimepiride combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.
