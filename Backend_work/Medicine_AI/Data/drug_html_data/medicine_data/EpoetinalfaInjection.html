<html><head></head><body><h1>Epoetin alfa (Injection)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> epoetin alfa (e-POE-e-tin AL-fa)</p><p>Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) increase the risks for death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and other serious cardiovascular events. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), patients are at a greater risk for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target Hb levels of 11 g/dL and above. No clinical trial has identified an Hb target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks; use at lowest sufficient dose is recommended. In cancer patients with certain tumor types (ie, breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, cervical), ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in some clinical studies. In patients with cancer, use the lowest ESA dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions and serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions. Use ESAs only for treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course. Patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy should not be treated with ESAs when the anticipated outcome is cure. Deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis should be considered when epoetin alfa is used preoperatively .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

EPO is produced naturally in the body, mostly by the kidneys. It stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. If the body does not produce enough EPO, severe anemia can occur. This often occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease whose kidneys are not working properly. Epoetin is used to treat severe anemia in patients on kidney dialysis or for those not on dialysis.</p><p>Epoetin may also be used to prevent or treat anemia that is caused by surgery or medicines (eg, zidovudine) that are used for other conditions, such as HIV or cancer.</p><p>Epoetin alfa is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using epoetin alfa</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For epoetin alfa, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to epoetin alfa or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of epoetin injection in children 1 month of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 month of age with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, children younger than 5 years of age with cancer, children with chronic kidney disease not undergoing dialysis, or children with HIV infection.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of epoetin injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of epoetin alfa. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of epoetin alfa</h2><p>Epoetin injection is usually given by a doctor after a kidney dialysis treatment in a hospital or clinic. However, medicines given by injection are sometimes used at home. If you will be using epoetin at home, your doctor will teach you how the injections are to be given. Be sure that you understand exactly how the medicine is to be injected.</p><p>It may be given as a shot under your skin or into a vein. If your doctor tells you to inject it in a certain way, follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Epoetin alfa comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>If you are using epoetin alfa at home:</p><ul>
<li>Use a new needle and syringe each time you inject your medicine.</li>
<li>Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.</li>
<li>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given.</li>
<li>If you use the vials that have one dose, you might not use all of the medicine in each vial. Use each vial only once and throw any extra medicine away. Do not save an opened vial.</li>
<li>If you use the vial that has enough medicine for more than one dose, put it back in the refrigerator after use. Write the date on the vial that you first used it and throw away any unused medicine after 21 days.</li>
</ul><p>Do not shake the vial before using it. Do not use epoetin alfa if it has been frozen.</p><p>If the medicine in the vial has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it.</p><p><i>Carefully follow your doctor's instructions about any special diet</i>. You may need to eat foods that contain iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12 such as eggs, certain cereals, meats, and vegetables, or you may take an iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12 supplement while you are using epoetin alfa.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of epoetin alfa will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of epoetin alfa. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>If you miss a dose of epoetin alfa, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><p>Store in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.</p><p>Protect the medicine from bright light. Keep your medicine in the original package until you are ready to use it.</p><p>Throw away used needles in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through (puncture-resistant). Keep this container away from children and pets.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using epoetin alfa</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check the blood of you or your child on a regular basis while you are using epoetin alfa</i>. You may also need to monitor your blood pressure at home. If you notice any changes to your recommended blood pressure, call your doctor right away. .</p><p>Do not use epoetin alfa if you or your child have had an allergic reaction to albumin or products derived from human or animal cells.</p><p>Epoetin alfa contains benzyl alcohol which may cause serious reactions to newborn or premature infants. Discuss this with your doctor if you are concerned.</p><p>Epoetin sometimes causes seizures, especially during the first 90 days of treatment. During this time, it is best to <i>avoid driving, using heavy machinery, or doing other activities that could cause serious injury if a seizure occurs while you are performing them</i>.</p><p>People with severe anemia usually feel very tired and sick. When epoetin begins to work, usually in about 6 weeks, most people start to feel better. Some people are able to be more active. However, epoetin only corrects anemia. It has no effect on kidney disease, cancer, or any other medical problem that needs regular medical attention. Even if you or your child are feeling much better, <i>it is very important that you do not miss any appointments with your doctor or any dialysis treatments</i>. .</p><p>Epoetin alfa may increase your risk of having serious heart and blood vessel problems, such as congestive heart failure, heart attacks, or stroke. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having dizziness, fainting spells, severe tiredness, chest pain, trouble with breathing, sudden or severe headache, or problems with vision, speech, or walking. .</p><p>Epoetin alfa may increase your risk of having blood clots. This is more likely in patients who use high doses of epoetin alfa, or who use epoetin alfa before a major surgery. Call your doctor right away if you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or pain, redness, or swelling in your arms or legs while using epoetin alfa. If you are getting dialysis treatments, tell your doctor right away if you notice blood clots at the injection site. Your doctor may give you a blood thinner before surgery to help prevent blood clots.</p><p>Epoetin alfa may cause blood clots to form in the access port (A-V shunt) for patients with chronic kidney disease who receive dialysis treatments. This would cause the access port to stop working. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child see blood clots forming in the access port.</p><p>When used in patients with certain types of cancer (eg, breast, cervix, lymphoid, lung, head, or neck cancer), epoetin alfa has shortened survival time and worsened the tumor or cancer in some patients. If you or your child are concerned about this, talk with your doctor.</p><p>Epoetin alfa may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema. These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using epoetin alfa.</p><p>Serious skin reactions can occur with epoetin alfa. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or a skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills with epoetin alfa.</p><p>Epoetin is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns.</p><p>Many people with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by epoetin treatment) may need to be on a special diet or to take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, it is very important that you or your child follow your special diet and take your medicines regularly, even if you are feeling better.</p><p>In addition to epoetin, your body needs iron and vitamins to make red blood cells. Your doctor may direct you or your child to take iron or vitamin supplements. Be sure to follow your doctor's orders carefully. Epoetin will not work properly if there is not enough iron or vitamins in your body.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Epoetin alfa side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
