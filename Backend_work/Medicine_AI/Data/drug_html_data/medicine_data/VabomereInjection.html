</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Vabomere Injection</h2><h3>. Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis</h3><p class="First">VABOMERE<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for the treatment of patients 18 years of age and older with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, and <span class="Italics">Enterobacter cloacae species</span> complex.</p><h3>. Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of VABOMERE and other antibacterial drugs, VABOMERE should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Vabomere Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of VABOMERE is 4 grams (meropenem 2 grams and vaborbactam 2 grams) administered every 8 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion over 3 hours in patients 18 years of age and older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The duration of treatment is for up to 14 days.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment who have an eGFR less than 50 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The recommended dosage of VABOMERE in patients with varying degrees of renal function is presented in Table 1. For patients with changing renal function, monitor serum creatinine concentrations and eGFR at least daily and adjust the dosage of VABOMERE accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Meropenem and vaborbactam are removed by hemodialysis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. For patients maintained on hemodialysis, administer VABOMERE after a hemodialysis session.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration of VABOMERE for Intravenous Infusion</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preparation</span></p><p>VABOMERE is supplied as a dry powder in a single-dose vial that must be constituted and further diluted prior to intravenous infusion as outlined below. VABOMERE does not contain preservatives. Aseptic technique must be used for constitution and dilution.</p><p>1. To prepare the required dose for intravenous infusion, constitute the appropriate number of vials, as determined from Table 2 below. Withdraw 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, from an infusion bag and constitute each vial of VABOMERE.</p><p>2. Mix gently to dissolve. The constituted VABOMERE solution will have an approximate meropenem concentration of 0.05 gram/mL and an approximate vaborbactam concentration of 0.05 gram/mL. The final volume is approximately 21.3 mL. The constituted solution is not for direct injection.</p><p>3. The constituted solution must be diluted further, immediately, in a 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP infusion bag before intravenous infusion. The intravenous infusion of the diluted solution <span class="Bold">must be completed</span> within 4 hours if stored at room temperature or 22 hours if stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).</p><p>4. To dilute the constituted solution, withdraw the full or partial constituted vial contents from each vial and add it back into the infusion bag in accordance with Table 2 below.</p><p>5. Visually inspect the diluted VABOMERE solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the color of the VABOMERE infusion solution for administration ranges from colorless to light yellow). Discard unused portion after use.</p><h3>Drug Compatibility</h3><p class="First">VABOMERE solution for administration by 3-hour infusion is only compatible with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.</p><p>Compatibility of VABOMERE solution for administration with other drugs has not been established.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">VABOMERE 2 grams (meropenem and vaborbactam) for injection, is supplied as a white to light yellow sterile powder for constitution in single-dose, clear glass vials containing meropenem 1 gram (equivalent to 1.14 grams meropenem trihydrate) and vaborbactam 1 gram.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">VABOMERE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of VABOMERE (meropenem and vaborbactam), or to other drugs in the same class or in patients who have demonstrated anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in patients treated with VABOMERE in the clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another beta-lactam antibacterial drug. Before initiating therapy with VABOMERE, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to VABOMERE occurs, discontinue the drug immediately.</p><h3>Seizure Potential</h3><p class="First">Seizures and other adverse Central Nervous System (CNS) experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem, which is a component of VABOMERE. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p>Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, place on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and reexamine the dosage of VABOMERE to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued.</p><h3>Clostridioides difficile-associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridioides difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including VABOMERE, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing isolates of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of VABOMERE and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of VABOMERE is necessary, consider supplemental anticonvulsant therapy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed in patients treated with meropenem, but no clinical bleeding has been reported <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Potential for Neuromotor Impairment</h3><p class="First">Alert patients receiving VABOMERE on an outpatient basis regarding adverse reactions such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that VABOMERE is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing VABOMERE in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of drug-resistant bacteria <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Overgrowth of Nonsusceptible Organisms</h3><p class="First">As with other antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of VABOMERE may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>VABOMERE was evaluated in a Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trial in cUTI, including pyelonephritis, which included 272 patients treated with VABOMERE and 273 patients treated with the comparator piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 grams (piperacillin 4 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) every 8 hours. After a minimum of 15 doses of IV therapy, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily every 24 hours) to complete the treatment course. Mean duration of IV therapy was 8 days in both treatment groups. Mean duration of IV and oral therapy was 10 days; patients with baseline bacteremia could receive up to 14 days of treatment.</p><p>The mean age of patients treated with VABOMERE was 53 years (range 18 to 92 years), and 32% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly female (66.5%) and White (93.4%). Most patients were enrolled in Europe (89.7%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation</span></p><p>Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 2.9% (8/272) of patients receiving VABOMERE and in 5.1% (14/273) of patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam. Most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of VABOMERE included hypersensitivity, 1.1% (3/272) and infusion-related reactions, 0.7% (2/272). Death occurred in 2 (0.7%) patients who received VABOMERE and in 2 (0.7%) patients who received piperacillin/tazobactam.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions (3% or greater) in patients receiving VABOMERE in the Phase 3 cUTI trial were headache, phlebitis/infusion site reactions, and diarrhea. Table 3 provides adverse reactions occurring in 1% or greater of patients receiving VABOMERE in the Phase 3 cUTI trial.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Occurring in Less Than 1% of Patients Receiving VABOMERE in the Phase 3 cUTI trial</span>:</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and lymphatic system disorders</span>: leukopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions</span>: chest discomfort</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and infestations</span>: pharyngitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, oral candidiasis</p><p><span class="Italics">Investigations</span>: creatinine phosphokinase increase</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and nutrition disorders</span>: decreased appetite, hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders</span>: dizziness, tremor, paresthesia, lethargy</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders</span>: hallucination, insomnia</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal and urinary disorders</span>: azotemia, renal impairment</p><p><span class="Italics">Vascular disorders</span>: deep vein thrombosis, hypotension, vascular pain</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions Associated with Meropenem</span></p><p>Additionally, adverse reactions reported with meropenem alone that were not reported in VABOMERE-treated patients in the Phase 3 clinical trial are listed below:</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and lymphatic system disorders</span>: thrombocytosis, neutropenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders</span>: abdominal pain</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary disorders</span>: jaundice</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders</span>: convulsions</p><p><span class="Italics">Investigations</span>: blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood bilirubin increased, blood creatinine increased, blood urea increased, blood thromboplastin decreased, prothrombin time decreased, Direct and Indirect Coombs test positive</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span>: pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome, Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, erythema multiforme</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders</span>: angioedema</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions</span>: pain</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Valproic Acid</h3><p class="First">Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of VABOMERE is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with VABOMERE is not recommended.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Fetal malformations were observed in vaborbactam-treated rabbits, therefore advise pregnant women of the potential risks to the fetus. There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug-associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriages with VABOMERE, meropenem, or vaborbactam in pregnant women.</p><p>Malformations (supernumerary lung lobes, interventricular septal defect) were observed in offspring from pregnant rabbits administered intravenous vaborbactam during the period of organogenesis at doses approximately equivalent to or above the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on plasma AUC comparison. The clinical relevance of the malformations is uncertain. No similar malformations or fetal toxicity were observed in offspring from pregnant rats administered intravenous vaborbactam during organogenesis or from late pregnancy and through lactation at a dose equivalent to approximately 1.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.</p><p>No fetal toxicity or malformations were observed in pregnant rats and cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenous meropenem during organogenesis at doses up to 1.6 and 1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison, respectively. In rats administered intravenous meropenem in late pregnancy and during the lactation period, there were no adverse effects on offspring at doses equivalent to approximately 1.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span></p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Meropenem</span></p><p>Reproductive studies have been performed with meropenem in rats at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day and in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 360 mg/kg/day (on the basis of body surface area comparisons, approximately 1.6 times and 1.2 times higher, respectively, than the MRHD of 2 grams every 8 hours). These studies revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to meropenem, although there were slight changes in fetal body weight at doses of 250 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 0.4 times the MRHD of 2 grams every 8 hours based on body surface area comparison) and above in rats. In a published study<span class="Sup">1</span>, meropenem administered to pregnant rats from Gestation Day 6 to Gestation Day 17, was associated with mild maternal weight loss at all doses, but did not produce malformations or fetal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for fetal toxicity in this study was considered to be the high dose of 750 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 1.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison).</p><p>In a peri-postnatal study in rats described in the published literature<span class="Sup">1</span>, intravenous meropenem was administered to dams from Gestation Day 17 until Postpartum Day 21. There were no adverse effects in the dams and no adverse effects in the first generation offspring (including developmental, behavioral, and functional assessments and reproductive parameters) except that female offspring exhibited lowered body weights which continued during gestation and nursing of the second generation offspring. Second generation offspring showed no meropenem-related effects. The NOAEL value was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vaborbactam</span></p><p>In a rat embryo-fetal toxicology study, intravenous administration of vaborbactam during Gestation Days 6-17 showed no evidence of maternal or embryofetal toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg, which is equivalent to approximately 1.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons. In the rabbit, intravenous administration of vaborbactam during Gestation Days 7–19 at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the MRHD based on AUC exposure comparison) was not associated with maternal toxicity or fetal weight loss. A low incidence of malformations occurred in the 300 mg/kg/day mid-dose group (two fetuses from different litters with interventricular septal defects, one fetus with a fused right lung lobe and one fetus with a supernumerary lung lobe), and in the 1000 mg/kg/day high-dose group (two fetuses from different litters with supernumerary lobes). The NOAEL was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day which is equivalent to 0.3 times the MRHD based on plasma AUC exposure comparison and 6-times the MRHD based on maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) comparison. The clinical relevance of the malformations is uncertain. Vaborbactam C<span class="Sub">max</span> values may have influenced malformations in the rabbit study, and the recommended 3-hour infusion time for clinical administration of vaborbactam is associated with lower plasma C<span class="Sub">max</span> values than the 30-minute infusions in rabbits.</p><p>In a peri-postnatal study in rats, vaborbactam administered intravenously to pregnant dams from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 20 caused no adverse effects on the dams, or in first and second generation offspring. The NOAEL was considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 1.6 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparison).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">Meropenem has been reported to be excreted in human milk. It is unknown whether vaborbactam is excreted in human milk. No information is available on the effects of meropenem and vaborbactam on the breast-fed child or on milk production.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for VABOMERE and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from VABOMERE or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of VABOMERE in pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of age) has not been established. Studies of VABOMERE have not been conducted in patients younger than 18 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 272 patients treated with VABOMERE in the Phase 3 cUTI trial, 48 (18%) patients were 65 years of age and older, while 39 (14%) patients were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Meropenem, a component of VABOMERE, is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><p>Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis found no clinically relevant change in pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly patients. No dosage adjustment based on age is required. Dosage adjustment for elderly patients should be based on renal function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies conducted with meropenem and vaborbactam in subjects with renal impairment have shown that the plasma exposures of both meropenem and vaborbactam increased with decreasing renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Dosage adjustment for VABOMERE is recommended in patients with renal impairment (eGFR less than 50 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><p>For patients with changing renal function, monitor serum creatinine concentrations and eGFR at least daily and adjust the dosage of VABOMERE accordingly. Meropenem and vaborbactam are removed by hemodialysis. Following a single dose of VABOMERE, vaborbactam exposure was substantially greater when VABOMERE was administered after hemodialysis than before hemodialysis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of overdose, discontinue VABOMERE and institute general supportive treatment.</p><p>Meropenem and vaborbactam can be removed by hemodialysis. In subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) administered meropenem 1 gram and vaborbactam 1 gram, the mean total recovery in dialysate following a hemodialysis session was 38% and 53% of the administered dose of meropenem and vaborbactam, respectively.</p><p>No clinical information is available on the use of hemodialysis to treat VABOMERE overdosage.</p><h2>Vabomere Injection Description</h2><p class="First">VABOMERE (meropenem and vaborbactam) for injection is a combination product that contains meropenem, a synthetic penem antibacterial drug and vaborbactam, a cyclic boronic acid beta-lactamase inhibitor, for intravenous administration.</p><p>Meropenem, present as a trihydrate, is a white to light yellow crystalline powder, with a molecular weight of 437.52.

The bactericidal action of meropenem results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Meropenem penetrates the cell wall of most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to bind penicillin-binding protein (PBP) targets. Meropenem is stable to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases, including penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, with the exception of carbapenem hydrolyzing beta-lactamases.</p><p>The vaborbactam component of VABOMERE is a non-suicidal beta-lactamase inhibitor that protects meropenem from degradation by certain serine beta-lactamases such as <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span> carbapenemase (KPC). Vaborbactam does not have any antibacterial activity. Vaborbactam does not decrease the activity of meropenem against meropenem-susceptible organisms.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>Mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance may include the production of beta-lactamases, modification of PBPs by gene acquisition or target alteration, up-regulation of efflux pumps, and loss of outer membrane porin.

Clinical and microbiological response was also assessed at the Test of Cure (TOC) visit (approximately 7 days after completion of treatment) in the m-MITT population and required both a clinical outcome of cure and a microbiological outcome of eradication.</p><p>Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups in the m-MITT population. Approximately 93% of patients were Caucasian and 66% were females in both treatment groups. The mean age was 54 years with 32% and 42% patients greater than 65 years of age in VABOMERE and piperacillin/tazobactam treatment groups, respectively.

The proportion of patients with diabetes mellitus at baseline was 17% and 19% in VABOMERE and piperacillin/tazobactam treatment groups, respectively. The majority of patients (approximately 90%) were enrolled from Europe, and approximately 2% of patients were enrolled from North America. Overall, in both treatment groups, 59% of patients had pyelonephritis and 40% had cUTI, with 21% and 19% of patients having a non-removable and removable source of infection, respectively.</p><p>Mean duration of IV treatment in both treatment groups was 8 days and mean total treatment duration (IV and oral) was 10 days; patients with baseline bacteremia could receive up to 14 days of therapy. Approximately 10% of patients in each treatment group in the m-MITT population had a levofloxacin-resistant pathogen at baseline and received levofloxacin as the oral switch therapy. This protocol violation may have impacted the assessment of the outcomes at the TOC visit. These patients were not excluded from the analysis presented in Table 6, as the decision to switch to oral levofloxacin was based on post-randomization factors.</p><p>VABOMERE demonstrated efficacy with regard to clinical and microbiological response at the EOIVT visit and TOC visits in the m-MITT population as shown in Table 6.</p><p>In the m-MITT population, the rate of clinical and microbiological response in VABOMERE- treated patients with concurrent bacteremia at baseline was 10/12 (83.3%).</p><p>In a subset of the <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> and <span class="Italics">K. pneumoniae</span> isolates, genotypic testing identified certain ESBL groups (e.g., TEM, CTX-M, SHV and OXA) in both treatment groups of the Phase 3 cUTI trial.
