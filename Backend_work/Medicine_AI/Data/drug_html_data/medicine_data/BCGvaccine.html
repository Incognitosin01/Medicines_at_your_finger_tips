BCG vaccine is recommended if you live with or have close contact with someone who is infected with tuberculosis.</p><p>This vaccine helps your body develop immunity to the TB, but will not treat an active infection you already have.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the BCG vaccine vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><p>BCG vaccine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have a weak immune system caused by disease such as HIV or cancer, or by using steroids or receiving chemotherapy or radiation.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive BCG vaccine if you are allergic to it, or if you have a weak immune system caused by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>HIV or AIDS;</p>

<li>
<p>leukemia, lymphoma, or other cancers;</p>

<li>
<p>chemotherapy or radiation; or</p>

<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul><p>a positive TB skin test; or</p><p>an inherited immune system problem (in you or a family member).</p><p>It is not known whether BCG vaccine will harm an unborn baby. However, this vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="directions">How is BCG vaccine given?</h2><p>Before you receive BCG vaccine, your doctor will perform a skin test to make sure you do not have tuberculosis.</p><p>BCG vaccine is not given with a needle and syringe, as most other vaccines are. Instead, the BCG vaccine is a liquid placed directly onto the skin of your upper arm. Then a multi-pronged needle device is used to prick the skin through the liquid to deliver the vaccine into the shallow layers of skin. These needle sticks are not deep, but they will cause some soreness and minor bleeding.</p><p>You may have flu-like symptoms for up to 2 days after you receive BCG vaccine. Call your doctor at once if you have a fever of 103 degrees F or higher.</p><p>Within 10 to 14 days after receiving this vaccine, you should see small red bumps on your skin where the vaccine and needle device were placed. This red area will gradually grow larger after 4 to 6 weeks, and then scale and fade. After 6 months you will most likely have little to no scar.</p><p>BCG vaccine contains a live form of tuberculosis bacteria, which can "shed" from your injection site. This means that <b>for a short time after you receive the vaccine, your vaccination sore will be contagious and could spread the bacteria to anything or anyone who touches it.</b></p><p>Keep your vaccination sore loosely covered with clothing or a light gauze dressing for at least 24 hours.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have any unexpected skin changes or severe irritation, lesions, or oozing where the needle sticks were placed. These reactions could occur up to 5 months after you received BCG vaccine.</p><p>You will need another TB skin test 2 to 3 months after you received the BCG vaccine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>This vaccine is usually given as a single dose. <b>You may need a repeat vaccine if your TB skin test is still negative 2 to 3 months after you received your first BCG vaccine.</b></p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since this vaccine is given by a healthcare professional, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving BCG vaccine?</h2><p>Avoid touching your vaccination sore for at least 24 hours.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">BCG vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
