Accretropin is also indicated for the treatment of short stature associated with Turner Syndrome in pediatric patients whose epiphyses are not closed.</p><p>Accretropin is identical in sequence to authentic human growth hormone of pituitary origin. Natural human growth hormone is a protein produced by the pituitary gland that acts on the ends of the long bones of the body (epiphyses) until the onset of puberty and promotes growth to normal stature. A deficiency of this hormone during childhood results in abnormally small stature.</p><p>Turner Syndrome is an X-chromosome-linked genetic disorder in girls that results in short stature and infertility.</p><p>Source: Cangene</p><h2>Accretropin Consumer Information</h2><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">What is Accretropin?</h2><p>Accretropin is a form of human growth hormone.</p><p>Accretropin is used to treat growth failure in children who lack natural growth hormone.
