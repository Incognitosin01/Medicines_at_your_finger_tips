May depress the formation, release, and activity of endogenous chemical mediators of inflammation (kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins) through the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins (lipocortins) and sequential inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid. Halcinonide has high range potency.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Dependent on strength of preparation, amount applied, integrity of skin at application site, vehicle, and use of occlusive dressing; increased in areas of skin damage, inflammation, or occlusion.</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Primarily hepatic</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Steroid-responsive dermatoses</b>: Relief of inflammatory and pruritic effects of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses (high potency topical corticosteroid)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to halcinonide or any component of the formulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Steroid-responsive dermatoses:</b> Topical: Apply to affected area sparingly 2 to 3 times daily. Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved; if no improvement is seen, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Dosage should be based on severity of disease and patient response; use smallest amount for shortest period of time to avoid hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved.</p><p><b>Dermatoses (corticosteroid-responsive, including contact/atopic dermatitis):</b></p><p>Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Cream, ointment, or solution: 0.1% strength: Topical: Apply to affected area 1 to 3 times daily; most experts suggest once or twice daily application; suggested maximum duration of therapy for high potency agents: 14 days (AAP [Eichenfield 2015]; NICE 2007). <b>Note:</b> Halcinonide 0.1% (cream/ointment/solution) is a group/class 2 highly potent topical corticosteroid; use should be reserved for severe cases; it should not be routinely used on the face or neck (AAP [Eichenfield 2015]; AAP [Tollefson 2014]; NICE 2007; Waldman 2018).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Topical: For external use only; not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. Wash hands before and after use. Avoid use of topical preparations on weeping or exudative lesions.</p><p>Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or other recalcitrant conditions. Gently rub or apply a small amount of cream, ointment, or solution to the affected area. Cover with a pliable nonporous film and seal the edges. If additional moisture is needed on the affected area, it may be moistened with water prior to applying medication; a damp cloth may also be applied to the lesion before the dressing is applied. Cream, ointment, or solution should be reapplied at each dressing change. Discontinue use of occlusive dressings if an infection develops.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at room temperature; avoid excessive heat ≥40°C (≥104°F)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined. Adverse reactions reported with topical corticosteroids; may occur more frequently with occlusive dressing.</p><p>Central nervous system: Intracranial hypertension (children), localized burning</p><p>Dermatologic: Acneiform eruption, allergic contact dermatitis, atrophic striae, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, hypopigmentation, maceration of the skin, miliaria, perioral dermatitis, pruritus, skin atrophy, xeroderma</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Cushing syndrome, glycosuria, growth suppression (children), HPA-axis suppression, hyperglycemia</p><p>Infection: Secondary infection</p><p>Local: Local irritation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.</p><p>• Contact dermatitis: Allergic contact dermatitis can occur, it is usually diagnosed by failure to heal rather than clinical exacerbation.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection; discontinue if dermatological infection persists despite appropriate antifungal or antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>• Kaposi's sarcoma: Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids has been associated with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (case reports); if noted, discontinuation of therapy should be considered.</p><p>• Sensitization: Topical use has been associated with local sensitization (redness, irritation); discontinue if sensitization is noted.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, or application to large surface areas.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Because of the risk of adverse effects associated with systemic absorption, topical corticosteroids should be used cautiously in the elderly in the smallest possible effective dose for the shortest duration.</p><p>• Pediatric: Infants and children may absorb proportionally larger amounts after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing's syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; Zar 2007).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For external use only; not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. Avoid use of topical preparations with occlusive dressings or on weeping or exudative lesions.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Evaluate for HPA axis suppression by using the following tests: ACTH stimulation test, urinary free cortisol test; growth (adolescents/children); presence of infection</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Teratogenic effects have been observed in animals administered potent topical corticosteroids. Topical products are not recommended for extensive use, in large quantities, or for long periods of time in pregnant women (Reed, 1997).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat skin irritation.</p><p>• It is used to treat skin rashes.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
