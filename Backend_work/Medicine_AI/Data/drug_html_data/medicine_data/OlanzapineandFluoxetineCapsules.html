Conversely, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4.1)</span>].</p><h3>Use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue</h3><p class="First">Do not start Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4.1)</span>].</p><p>In some cases, a patient already receiving olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for five weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>].</p><h3>Discontinuation of Treatment with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</h3><p class="First">Symptoms associated with discontinuation of fluoxetine, a component of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, SNRIs, and SSRIs, have been reported [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.25</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Capsules (mg olanzapine, USP/mg equivalent fluoxetine):</p><ul class="Disk">

Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules can also prolong the QT interval.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults</h3><p class="First">Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug versus placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Age Range</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated</span></p><p class="First">Increases Compared to Placebo</p><p class="First">&lt;18</p><p class="First">14 additional cases</p><p class="First">18 to 24</p><p class="First">5 additional cases</p><p class="First">Decreases Compared to Placebo</p><p class="First">25 to 64</p><p class="First">1 fewer case</p><p class="First">≥65</p><p class="First">6 fewer cases</p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p><p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</p><p>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.25</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.</span> Prescriptions for Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</p><p>It should be noted that Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules are not approved for use in treating any indications in patients less than 10 years of age [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].</p><h3>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Boxed Warning</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span></span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">]</span>.</span></p><p>In olanzapine placebo-controlled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients was significantly greater than placebo-treated patients (3.5% vs 1.5%, respectively).</p><p><span class="Bold">Meta-Analysis of Antipsychotic Use in Dementia-Related Psychosis</span> – Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke</span> — Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine and Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [<span class="Italics">see Boxed Warning</span>].</p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</h3><p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as NMS has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.</p><p>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.</p><p>If after recovering from NMS, a patient requires treatment with an antipsychotic, the patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>].</p><h3>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)</h3><p class="First">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with olanzapine exposure. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. DRESS is sometimes fatal. Discontinue Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules if DRESS is suspected.</p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Metabolic changes may be associated with increased cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. Olanzapine’s specific metabolic profile is presented below.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span> — Healthcare providers should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100 to 126 mg/dL, nonfasting 140 to 200 mg/dL). Patients taking Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</p><p>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine alone, as well as olanzapine taken concomitantly with fluoxetine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics.</p><p>Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mg/dL.</p><p>In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N=22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mg/dL. Placebo-treated subjects (N=19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mg/dL.</p><p>In an analysis of 7 controlled clinical studies, 2 of which were placebo-controlled, with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules were associated with a greater mean change in random glucose compared to placebo (+8.65 mg/dL vs. -3.86 mg/dL). The difference in mean changes between Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (including those patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with anti-diabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level ≥200 mg/dL, or a baseline fasting glucose level ≥126 mg/dL). Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients had a greater mean HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> increase from baseline of 0.15% (median exposure 63 days), compared to a mean HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> decrease of 0.04% in fluoxetine-treated subjects (median exposure 57 days) and a mean HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> increase of 0.12% in olanzapine-treated patients (median exposure 56 days).</p><p>In an analysis of 6 controlled clinical studies, a larger proportion of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated subjects had glycosuria (4.4%) compared to placebo-treated subjects (1.4%).</p><p>The mean change in nonfasting glucose in patients exposed at least 48 weeks was +5.9 mg/dL (N=425).</p><p>Table 2 shows short-term and long-term changes in random glucose levels from adult olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule studies.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Analyte</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Category Change (at least once) from Baseline</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment Arm</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Up to 12 weeks exposure</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">At least 48 weeks exposure</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients</span></p><p class="First">Random Glucose</p><p class="First">Normal to High (&lt;140 mg/dL to ≥200 mg/dL)</p><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</p><p class="First">609</p><p class="First">2.3%</p><p class="First">382</p><p class="First">3.1%</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">346</p><p class="First">0.3%</p><p class="First">NA<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">NA<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">Borderline to High (≥140 mg/dL and &lt;200 mg/dL to ≥200 mg/dL)</p><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</p><p class="First">44</p><p class="First">34.1%</p><p class="First">27</p><p class="First">37.0%</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">28</p><p class="First">3.6%</p><p class="First">NA<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">NA<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> Not Applicable.</p><p>In a 47-week olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule study, the mean change from baseline to endpoint in fasting glucose was +4.81 mg/dL (n=130). <span class="Bold">Table 3</span> shows the categorical changes in fasting glucose [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Up to 27 Weeks Exposure (Randomized, Double-Blind Phase)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Up to 47 Weeks Exposure</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Analyte</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Category Change (at least once) from Baseline</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment Arm</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients</span></p><p class="First">Fasting Glucose</p><p class="First">Normal to High (&lt;100 mg/dL to ≥126 mg/dL)</p><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</p><p class="First">90</p><p class="First">4.4%</p><p class="First">130</p><p class="First">11.5%</p><p class="First">Fluoxetine</p><p class="First">96</p><p class="First">5.2%</p><p class="First">NA<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">NA<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">Borderline to High (≥100 mg/dL and &lt;126 mg/dL to ≥126 mg/dL)</p><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</p><p class="First">98</p><p class="First">18.4%</p><p class="First">79</p><p class="First">32.9%</p><p class="First">Fluoxetine</p><p class="First">97</p><p class="First">7.2%</p><p class="First">NA<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">NA<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> Not Applicable.</p><p>Controlled fasting glucose data is limited for Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules; however, in an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (+2.76 mg/dL vs. +0.17 mg/dL).</p><p>The mean change in fasting glucose for olanzapine-treated patients exposed at least 48 weeks was +4.2 mg/dL (N=487).

Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.</p><p>The concomitant use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5) and Contraindications (4.1)</span>].</p><p>If concomitant use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.</p><p>Treatment with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.</p><h3>Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Angle-Closure Glaucoma</span> — The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.</p><h3>Allergic Reactions and Rash</h3><p class="First">In olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule premarketing controlled clinical studies, the overall incidence of rash or allergic reactions in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients [4.6% (26/571)] was similar to that of placebo [5.2% (25/477)]. The majority of the cases of rash and/or urticaria were mild; however, 3 patients discontinued (1 due to rash, which was moderate in severity and 2 due to allergic reactions, 1 of which included face edema).</p><p>In fluoxetine U.S. clinical studies, 7% of 10,782 fluoxetine-treated patients developed various types of rashes and/or urticaria. Among the cases of rash and/or urticaria reported in premarketing clinical studies, almost a third were withdrawn from treatment because of the rash and/or systemic signs or symptoms associated with the rash. Clinical findings reported in association with rash include fever, leukocytosis, arthralgias, edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, respiratory distress, lymphadenopathy, proteinuria, and mild transaminase elevation. Most patients improved promptly with discontinuation of fluoxetine and/or adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids, and all patients experiencing these reactions were reported to recover completely.</p><p>In fluoxetine premarketing clinical studies, 2 patients are known to have developed a serious cutaneous systemic illness. In neither patient was there an unequivocal diagnosis, but 1 was considered to have a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and the other, a severe desquamating syndrome that was considered variously to be a vasculitis or erythema multiforme. Other patients have had systemic syndromes suggestive of serum sickness.</p><p>Since the introduction of fluoxetine, systemic reactions, possibly related to vasculitis, have developed in patients with rash. Although these reactions are rare, they may be serious, involving the lung, kidney, or liver. Death has been reported to occur in association with these systemic reactions.</p><p>Anaphylactoid reactions, including bronchospasm, angioedema, and urticaria alone and in combination, have been reported.</p><p>Pulmonary reactions, including inflammatory processes of varying histopathology and/or fibrosis, have been reported rarely. These reactions have occurred with dyspnea as the only preceding symptom.</p><p>Whether these systemic reactions and rash have a common underlying cause or are due to different etiologies or pathogenic processes is not known. Furthermore, a specific underlying immunologic basis for these reactions has not been identified. Upon the appearance of rash or of other possible allergic phenomena for which an alternative etiology cannot be identified, Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be discontinued.</p><h3>Activation of Mania/Hypomania</h3><p class="First">A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of Bipolar Disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a manic episode in patients at risk for Bipolar Disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described for clinical worsening and suicide risk represent such a conversion is unknown<span class="Italics">.</span> However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for Bipolar Disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, Bipolar Disorder, and depression. It should be noted that Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules are approved for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder.</p><p>In the 3 controlled bipolar depression studies (2 in adults and 1 in children and adolescents [10 to 17 years of age]) there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of manic reactions (manic reaction or manic depressive reaction) between olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule- and placebo-treated patients. In 1 adult study, the incidence of manic reactions was (7% [3/43]) in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared to (3% [5/184]) in placebo-treated patients. In the other adult study, the incidence of manic reactions was (2% [1/43]) in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared to (8% [15/193]) in placebo-treated patients. In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, the incidence of manic reactions was (1% [2/170]) in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared to (0% [0/84]) in placebo-treated patients. Because of the cyclical nature of Bipolar I Disorder, patients should be monitored closely for the development of symptoms of mania/hypomania during treatment with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules.</p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First">A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</p><p>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. </span></p><p>The incidence of dyskinetic movement in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients was infrequent. The mean score on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-controlled database across clinical studies involving olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients decreased from baseline. Nonetheless, Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of tardive dyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules despite the presence of the syndrome. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period.</p><p>In the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-controlled clinical trials across all indications, there were no significant differences between olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients and olanzapine, fluoxetine- or placebo-treated patients in exposure-adjusted rates of orthostatic systolic blood pressure decreases of at least 30 mm Hg. Orthostatic systolic blood pressure decreases of at least 30 mm Hg occurred in 4.0% (28/705), 2.3% (19/831), 4.5% (18/399), and 1.8% (8/442) of the Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, olanzapine, fluoxetine, and placebo groups, respectively. In this group of studies, the incidence of syncope-related adverse reactions (i.e., syncope and/or loss of consciousness) in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients was 0.4% (3/771) compared to placebo 0.2% (1/477).</p><p>In a clinical pharmacology study of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, 3 healthy subjects were discontinued from the trial after experiencing severe, but self-limited, hypotension and bradycardia that occurred 2 to 9 hours following a single 12 mg/50 mg dose of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules. Reactions consisting of this combination of hypotension and bradycardia (and also accompanied by sinus pause) have been observed in at least 3 other healthy subjects treated with various formulations of olanzapine (1 oral, 2 intramuscular). In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of patients with a ≥20 bpm decrease in orthostatic pulse concomitantly with a ≥20 mm Hg decrease in orthostatic systolic blood pressure was 0.3% (2/706) in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group, 0.2% (1/445) in the placebo group, 0.7% (6/837) in the olanzapine group, and 0% (0/404) in the fluoxetine group.</p><p>Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications).</p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.</p><h3>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Class Effect</span> — In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.</p><p>Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.</p><p>Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) should discontinue Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and have their WBC followed until recovery.</p><h3>Dysphagia</h3><p class="First">Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer’s disease. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Seizures occurred in 0.2% (4/2547) of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients during open-label clinical studies. No seizures occurred in the controlled olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule studies. Seizures have also been reported with both olanzapine and fluoxetine monotherapy. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer’s dementia. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of ≥65 years of age.</p><h3>Abnormal Bleeding</h3><p class="First">SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, may increase the risk of bleeding reactions. Concomitant use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding reactions related to SNRIs and SSRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.</p><p>Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.4)</span>].</p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia has been reported during treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine and Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported and appeared to be reversible when [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span>]. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules were discontinued. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk. Discontinuation of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have been associated with hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.</p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule therapy does not affect them adversely.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span> — Sedation-related adverse reactions were commonly reported with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule treatment occurring at an incidence of 26.6% in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared with 10.9% in placebo-treated patients. Sedation-related adverse reactions (sedation, somnolence, hypersomnia, and lethargy) led to discontinuation in 2% (15/771) of patients in the controlled clinical studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Children and Adolescents</span> — In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, somnolence-related adverse events were commonly reported with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule treatment occurring at an incidence of 23.5% in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared with 2.4% in placebo-treated patients. Somnolence-related adverse events led to discontinuation in 1.2% (2/170) of patients.</p><h3>Body Temperature Dysregulation</h3><p class="First">Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic drugs. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature (e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration).</p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Post-marketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome; a previous history of QT prolongation; a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death; and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias; and conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure (overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs). Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4.2), Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8), Overdosage (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>Consider ECG assessment and periodic ECG monitoring if initiating treatment with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Consider discontinuing Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and obtaining a cardiac evaluation if patients develop signs or symptoms consistent with ventricular arrhythmia.</p><p>In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, there was a statistically significant difference in QT<span class="Sub">c</span> interval for patients treated with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules compared with patients on placebo: mean change in QT<span class="Sub">c</span>F (Fridericia correction factor) from baseline to endpoint in patients treated with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules was 8.2 msec (95% CI 6.2, 10.2). No patient developed QT<span class="Sub">c</span> increases ≥60 msec or QT<span class="Sub">c</span> ≥480 msec. Clinicians should use Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules with caution in those children or adolescents who are known to be particularly at risk for QT prolongation [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</p><h3>Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The following precautions for the individual components may be applicable to Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Olanzapine exhibits <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> muscarinic receptor affinity. In premarketing clinical studies, Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules were associated with constipation, dry mouth, and tachycardia, all adverse reactions possibly related to cholinergic antagonism. Such adverse reactions were not often the basis for study discontinuations; Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, constipation, a history of paralytic ileus, or related conditions.</span></p><h3>Hyperprolactinemia</h3><p class="First">As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors, Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules elevate prolactin levels, and the elevation persists during administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and erectile dysfunction have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.</p><p>Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds that increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [<span class="Italics">see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>]. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span> — In controlled clinical studies of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 28% of adults treated with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules as compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. The elevations persisted throughout administration of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 2929 adults treated with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events<span class="Sup">1</span> (1% [20/1946] of females), sexual function-related events<span class="Sup">2</span> (7% [192/2929] of females and males), and breast-related events<span class="Sup">3</span> (0.8% [16/1946] of females, 0.2% [2/983] of males).</p><p><span class="Bold">Children and Adolescents</span> — In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules were associated with a statistically significant greater mean change from baseline in prolactin levels compared to placebo (8.7 mcg/L vs 0.7 mcg/L, respectively). Although prolactin concentrations were very commonly (&gt;10%) elevated above normal in both the Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and placebo groups, more than twice as many olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients were seen with these elevations compared to placebo-treated patients. Five patients experienced an adverse event potentially associated with elevated prolactin; these events included dysmenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, and ovulation disorder.</p><p>The magnitude and frequency of change in prolactin in children and adolescents was larger than observed in adult patients treated with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, but was similar to that observed in adolescents treated with olanzapine monotherapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine Monotherapy</span></p><p>In placebo-controlled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30% of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5% of adults treated with placebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8136 adults treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events<span class="Sup">1</span> (2% [49/3240] of females), sexual function-related events<span class="Sup">2</span> (2% [150/8136] of females and males), and breast-related events<span class="Sup">3</span> (0.7% [23/3240] of females, 0.2% [9/4896] of males).</p><p>In placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescent patients (up to 6 weeks) with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 47% of olanzapine-treated patients compared to 7% of placebo-treated patients. In a pooled analysis from clinical trials including 454 adolescents treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events<span class="Sup">1</span> (1% [2/168] of females), sexual function-related events<span class="Sup">2</span> (0.7% [3/454] of females and males), and breast-related events<span class="Sup">3</span> (2% [3/168] of females, 2% [7/286] of males), [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].</p><p><span class="Sup">1</span> Based on a search of the following terms: amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menstruation delayed, and oligomenorrhea.</p><p><span class="Sup">2</span> Based on a search of the following terms: anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, loss of libido, abnormal orgasm, and sexual dysfunction.</p><p><span class="Sup">3</span> Based on a search of the following terms: breast discharge, enlargement or swelling, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and lactation disorder.</p><p>Dose group differences with respect to prolactin elevation have been observed.

Caution should be exercised when prescribing these medications concomitantly with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules [<span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10)</span>].</p><h3>Long Elimination Half-Life of Fluoxetine</h3><p class="First">Because of the long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and its major active metabolite, changes in dose will not be fully reflected in plasma for several weeks, affecting both strategies for titration to final dose and withdrawal from treatment. This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Discontinuation Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">During marketing of fluoxetine, a component of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, SNRIs, and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these reactions are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluoxetine. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentration decrease gradually at the conclusion of therapy, which may minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms with this drug [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data in the tables represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span> — The information below is derived from a clinical study database for Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules consisting of 2547 patients with treatment resistant depression, depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with psychosis, or sexual dysfunction with approximately 1085 patient-years of exposure. The conditions and duration of treatment with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term or long-term exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Controlled Studies Including Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder and Treatment Resistant Depression</span> — Overall, 11.3% of the 771 patients in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group discontinued due to adverse reactions compared with 4.4% of the 477 patients for placebo. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation associated with the use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules (incidence of at least 1% for Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and greater than that for placebo) using MedDRA Dictionary coding were weight increased (2%) and sedation (1%) versus placebo patients which had 0% incidence of weight increased and sedation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Controlled Studies Including Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder and Treatment Resistant Depression</span> — In short-term studies, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules (incidence ≥5% and at least twice that for placebo in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-controlled database) using MedDRA Dictionary coding were: disturbance in attention, dry mouth, fatigue, hypersomnia, increased appetite, peripheral edema, sedation, somnolence, tremor, vision blurred, and weight increased. Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination are generally consistent with treatment-emergent adverse reactions during olanzapine or fluoxetine monotherapy.</p><p>In a 47-week maintenance study in adults with treatment resistant depression, adverse reactions associated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule use were generally similar to those seen in short-term studies. Weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia were observed in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule -treated patients throughout the study.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in Short-Term Controlled Studies Including Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder and Treatment Resistant Depression</span> — <span class="Bold">Table 16</span> enumerates the treatment-emergent adverse reactions associated with the use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules (incidence of at least 2% for Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and twice or more than for placebo).

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, the frequency and severity are greater with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. In general, an elevated risk of acute dystonia may be observed in males and younger age groups receiving antipsychotics; however, events of dystonia have been reported infrequently (&lt;1%) with the olanzapine and fluoxetine combination.</p><p><span class="Bold">Additional Findings Observed in Clinical Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Sexual Dysfunction</span> — In the pool of controlled olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule studies in patients with bipolar depression, there were higher rates of the treatment-emergent adverse reactions decreased libido, anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction and abnormal ejaculation in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group than in the placebo group. One case of decreased libido led to discontinuation in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group. In the controlled studies that contained a fluoxetine arm, the rates of decreased libido and abnormal ejaculation in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group were less than the rates in the fluoxetine group. None of the differences were statistically significant.</p><p>Sexual dysfunction, including priapism, has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, healthcare providers should routinely inquire about such possible side effects.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule or fluoxetine treatment. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction occasionally persist after discontinuation of fluoxetine treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Difference Among Dose Levels Observed in Other Olanzapine Clinical Trials</span></p><p>In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (N=199), 20 (N=200), and 40 (N=200) mg/day of olanzapine in patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder, statistically significant differences among 3 dose groups were observed for the following safety outcomes: weight gain, prolactin elevation, fatigue, and dizziness. Mean baseline to endpoint increase in weight (10 mg/day: 1.9 kg; 20 mg/day: 2.3 kg; 40 mg/day: 3 kg) was observed with significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day.

The drug-drug interactions sections of fluoxetine and olanzapine are applicable to Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic drug inhibition or enhancement, etc.) is a possibility. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</h3><p class="First">[<span class="Italics">See Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>].</p><h3>CNS Acting Drugs</h3><p class="First">Caution is advised if the concomitant administration of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and other CNS-active drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">[<span class="Italics">See Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>].</p><h3>Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin)</h3><p class="First">Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SNRIs or SSRIs are coadministered with warfarin [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.16</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].

This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Alcohol</span> — Ethanol (45 mg/70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Inhibitors of CYP1A2</span> — Fluvoxamine decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine C<span class="Sub">max</span> following fluvoxamine administration of 54% in female nonsmokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52% and 108%, respectively. Lower doses of the olanzapine component of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine.</p><p><span class="Bold">The Effect of Other Drugs on Olanzapine</span> — Fluoxetine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, decreases olanzapine clearance a small amount [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Agents that induce CYP1A2 or glucuronyl transferase enzymes, such as omeprazole and rifampin, may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance. The effect of CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine and some fluoroquinolone antibiotics, on Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules has not been evaluated. Although olanzapine is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, induction or inhibition of a single enzyme may appreciably alter olanzapine clearance.

Pimozide can prolong the QT interval. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules can increase the level of pimozide through inhibition of CYP2D6. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules can also prolong the QT interval. Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QT<span class="Sub">c</span> prolongation. While a specific study with pimozide and Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QT<span class="Sub">c</span> prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.20</span><span class="Italics">), and Drug Interactions (7.8)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Carbamazepine</span> — Patients on stable doses of carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Alcohol</span> — <span class="Italics">The coadministration of ethanol with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules may potentiate sedation and orthostatic hypotension</span> [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.6)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Thioridazine</span> — Thioridazine should not be administered with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules or administered within a minimum of 5 weeks after discontinuation of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules because of the risk of QT prolongation [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.20</span><span class="Italics">), and Drug Interactions (7.8)</span>].</p><p>In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity.

Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for a decreased dose of the original medication should be considered.

These data indicate that fluoxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Olanzapine on Drugs Metabolized by Other CYP Enzymes</span> — <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes.</p><p><span class="Bold">Lithium</span> — Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of lithium.</p><p>There have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine.

The interaction between Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Because fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma protein, the administration of fluoxetine to a patient taking another drug that is tightly bound to protein (e.g., warfarin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect.

Use Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules with caution in combination with other drugs that cause QT prolongation. These include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus).

The reversibility of fluoxetine-induced muscle damage was not assessed.</p><p>These fluoxetine toxicities in juvenile rats have not been observed in adult animals. Plasma exposures (AUC) to fluoxetine in juvenile rats receiving 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day doses in this study are approximately 0.1 to 0.2, 1 to 2, and 5 to 10 times, respectively, the average exposure in pediatric patients receiving the MRHD of 20 mg/day. Rat exposures to the major metabolite, norfluoxetine, are approximately 0.3 to 0.8, 1 to 8, and 3 to 20 times, respectively, the pediatric exposure at the MRHD.</p><p>A specific effect on bone development was reported in juvenile mice administered fluoxetine by the intraperitoneal route to 4 week old mice for 4 weeks at doses 0.5 and 2 times the oral MRHD of 20 mg/day on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. There was a decrease in bone mineralization and density at both doses, but the overall growth (body weight gain or femur length) was not affected.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</span> — Clinical studies of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules did not include sufficient numbers of patients ≥65 years of age to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine</span> — Of the 2500 patients in premarketing clinical studies with olanzapine, 11% (263 patients) were ≥65 years of age. In patients with Schizophrenia, there was no indication of any different tolerability of olanzapine in the elderly compared with younger patients. Studies in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared with younger patients with Schizophrenia. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. In placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. In 5 placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (n=1184), the following treatment-emergent adverse reactions were reported in olanzapine-treated patients at an incidence of at least 2% and significantly greater than placebo-treated patients: falls, somnolence, peripheral edema, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, lethargy, increased weight, asthenia, pyrexia, pneumonia, dry mouth, and visual hallucinations. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was significantly greater with olanzapine than placebo (13% vs 7%). Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with olanzapine are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Olanzapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Boxed Warning</span><span class="Italics"> and Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Also, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance or increase the pharmacodynamic response to olanzapine should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose for any geriatric patient.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluoxetine</span> — U.S. fluoxetine clinical studies included 687 patients ≥65 years of age and 93 patients ≥75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. SNRIs and SSRIs, including Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.17</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In subjects with cirrhosis of the liver, the clearances of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, were decreased, thus increasing the elimination half-lives of these substances. A lower or less frequent dose of the fluoxetine-component of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules should be used in patients with cirrhosis. Caution is advised when using Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect its metabolism [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)</span>].</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, as with fluoxetine and olanzapine, have not been systematically studied in humans for their potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical studies did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic, and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, healthcare providers should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p><p>In studies in rats and rhesus monkeys designed to assess abuse and dependence potential, olanzapine alone was shown to have acute depressive CNS effects but little or no potential of abuse or physical dependence at oral doses up to 15 (rat) and 8 (monkey) times the MRHD (20 mg) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</span> — During premarketing clinical studies of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, overdose of both fluoxetine and olanzapine were reported in 5 study subjects. Four of the 5 subjects experienced loss of consciousness (3) or coma (1). No fatalities occurred.</p><p>Adverse reactions involving overdose of fluoxetine and olanzapine in combination, and Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, have been reported. An overdose of combination therapy is defined as confirmed or suspected ingestion of a dose of &gt;20 mg olanzapine in combination with a dose of &gt;80 mg fluoxetine. Adverse reactions associated with these reports included somnolence (sedation), impaired consciousness (coma), impaired neurologic function (ataxia, confusion, convulsions, dysarthria), arrhythmias, lethargy, essential tremor, agitation, acute psychosis, hypotension, hypertension, and aggression. Fatalities have been confounded by exposure to additional substances including alcohol, thioridazine, oxycodone, and propoxyphene.</p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine</span> — In postmarketing reports of overdose with olanzapine alone, symptoms have been reported in the majority of cases. In symptomatic patients, symptoms with ≥10% incidence included agitation/aggressiveness, dysarthria, tachycardia, various extrapyramidal symptoms, and reduced level of consciousness ranging from sedation to coma. Among less commonly reported symptoms were the following potentially medically serious reactions: aspiration, cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiac arrhythmias (such as supraventricular tachycardia as well as a patient that experienced sinus pause with spontaneous resumption of normal rhythm), delirium, possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome, respiratory depression/arrest, convulsion, hypertension, and hypotension. Reports of fatality in association with overdose of olanzapine alone have been received. In 1 case of death, the amount of acutely ingested olanzapine was reported to be possibly as low as 450 mg of oral olanzapine; however, in another case, a patient was reported to survive an acute olanzapine ingestion of approximately 2 g of oral olanzapine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluoxetine</span> — Worldwide exposure to fluoxetine is estimated to be over 38 million patients (circa 1999). Of the 1578 cases of overdose involving fluoxetine, alone or with other drugs, reported from this population, there were 195 deaths.</p><p>Among 633 adult patients who overdosed on fluoxetine alone, 34 resulted in a fatal outcome, 378 completely recovered, and 15 patients experienced sequelae after overdose, including abnormal accommodation, abnormal gait, confusion, unresponsiveness, nervousness, pulmonary dysfunction, vertigo, tremor, elevated blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, movement disorder, and hypomania. The remaining 206 patients had an unknown outcome. The most common signs and symptoms associated with non-fatal overdose were seizures, somnolence, nausea, tachycardia, and vomiting. The largest known ingestion of fluoxetine in adult patients was 8 grams in a patient who took fluoxetine alone and who subsequently recovered. However, in an adult patient who took fluoxetine alone, an ingestion as low as 520 mg has been associated with lethal outcome, but causality has not been established.</p><p>Among pediatric patients (ages 3 months to 17 years), there were 156 cases of overdose involving fluoxetine alone or in combination with other drugs. Six patients died, 127 patients completely recovered, 1 patient experienced renal failure, and 22 patients had an unknown outcome. One of the 6 fatalities was a 9-year-old boy who had a history of OCD, Tourette’s Syndrome with tics, attention deficit disorder, and fetal alcohol syndrome. He had been receiving 100 mg of fluoxetine daily for 6 months in addition to clonidine, methylphenidate, and promethazine. Mixed-drug ingestion or other methods of suicide complicated all 6 overdoses in children that resulted in fatalities. The largest ingestion in pediatric patients was 3 grams, which was non-lethal.</p><p>Other important adverse reactions reported with fluoxetine overdose (single or multiple drugs) included coma, delirium, ECG abnormalities (such as nodal rhythm, QT-interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias), hypotension, mania, neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like reactions, pyrexia, stupor, and syncope.</p><h3>Management of Overdose</h3><p class="First">For current information on the management of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules (olanzapine and fluoxetine) overdose, contact a Certified Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222). In managing overdose, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate ventilation. Commence cardiovascular monitoring immediately and include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.</p><p>A specific precaution involves patients who are taking or have recently taken Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules and may have ingested excessive quantities of a TCA (tricyclic antidepressant). In such cases, accumulation of the parent TCA and/or an active metabolite increases the possibility of serious sequelae and extends the time needed for close medical observation.</p><p>Due to the large volume of distribution of olanzapine and fluoxetine, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be of benefit. No specific antidote for either fluoxetine or olanzapine overdose is known.</p><h2>Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, USP combine an atypical antipsychotic and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, olanzapine, USP (the active ingredient in Zyprexa<span class="Sup">®</span>, and Zyprexa<span class="Sup">®</span> Zydis<span class="Sup">®</span>) and fluoxetine hydrochloride, USP (the active ingredient in Prozac<span class="Sup">®</span>, Prozac<span class="Sup">®</span> Weekly<span class="Sup">™</span>, and Sarafem<span class="Sup">®</span>).</p><p>Olanzapine, USP belongs to the thienobenzodiazepine class.

However, the combined effect of olanzapine and fluoxetine at the monoaminergic neural systems (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) could be responsible for the pharmacological effect.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Olanzapine binds with high affinity to the following receptors: serotonin 5HT<span class="Sub">2A/2C</span>, 5HT<span class="Sub">6</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=4, 11, and 5 nM, respectively), dopamine D<span class="Sub">1-4</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=11 to 31 nM), histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=7 nM), and adrenergic α<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=19 nM). Olanzapine is an antagonist with moderate affinity binding for serotonin 5HT<span class="Sub">3</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=57 nM) and muscarinic M<span class="Sub">1-5</span> (K<span class="Sub">i</span>=73, 96, 132, 32, and 48 nM, respectively). Olanzapine binds weakly to GABA<span class="Sub">A</span>, BZD, and β-adrenergic receptors (K<span class="Sub">i </span>&gt;10 μM). Fluoxetine is an inhibitor of the serotonin transporter and is a weak inhibitor of the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</span> — Fluoxetine (administered as a 60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily for 8 days) caused a small increase in the mean maximum concentration of olanzapine (16%) following a 5 mg dose, an increase in the mean area under the curve (17%) and a small decrease in mean apparent clearance of olanzapine (16%). In another study, a similar decrease in apparent clearance of olanzapine of 14% was observed following olanzapine doses of 6 or 12 mg with concomitant fluoxetine doses of 25 mg or more. The decrease in clearance reflects an increase in bioavailability. The terminal half-life is not affected, and therefore the time to reach steady state should not be altered. The overall steady-state plasma concentrations of olanzapine and fluoxetine when given as the combination in the therapeutic dose ranges were comparable with those typically attained with each of the monotherapies. The small change in olanzapine clearance, observed in both studies, likely reflects the inhibition of a minor metabolic pathway for olanzapine via CYP2D6 by fluoxetine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and was not deemed clinically significant. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of the individual components is expected to reasonably characterize the overall pharmacokinetics of the combination.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption and Bioavailability</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</span> — Following a single oral 12 mg/50 mg dose of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, peak plasma concentrations of olanzapine and fluoxetine occur at approximately 4 and 6 hours, respectively. The effect of food on the absorption and bioavailability of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules has not been evaluated. The bioavailability of olanzapine given as Zyprexa<span class="Sup">®</span>, and the bioavailability of fluoxetine given as Prozac<span class="Sup">®</span> were not affected by food. It is unlikely that there would be a significant food effect on the bioavailability of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules.</p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine</span> — Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentration approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption when olanzapine is given as Zyprexa<span class="Sup">®</span>. It is eliminated extensively by first pass metabolism, with approximately 40% of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluoxetine</span> — Following a single oral 40 mg dose, peak plasma concentrations of fluoxetine from 15 to 55 ng/mL are observed after 6 to 8 hours. Food does not appear to affect the systemic bioavailability of fluoxetine given as Prozac<span class="Sup">®</span>, although it may delay its absorption by 1 to 2 hours, which is probably not clinically significant.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</span> — The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding to human plasma proteins of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination is similar to the binding of the individual components.</p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine</span> — Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It is 93% bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ng/mL, binding primarily to albumin and α<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluoxetine</span> — Over the concentration range from 200 to 1000 ng/mL, approximately 94.5% of fluoxetine is bound <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to human serum proteins, including albumin and α<span class="Sub">1</span>-glycoprotein. The interaction between fluoxetine and other highly protein-bound drugs has not been fully evaluated [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</span> — Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule therapy yielded steady-state concentrations of norfluoxetine similar to those seen with fluoxetine in the therapeutic dose range.</p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine</span> — Olanzapine displays linear pharmacokinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its half-life ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 30 hr), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 L/hr (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 25 L/hr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steady-state concentrations in about 1 week that are approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, half-life, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals on the basis of smoking status, gender, and age [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)</span>].</p><p>Following a single oral dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled olanzapine, 7% of the dose of olanzapine was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57% and 30% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. In the plasma, olanzapine accounted for only 12% of the AUC for total radioactivity, indicating significant exposure to metabolites. After multiple dosing, the major circulating metabolites were the 10-N-glucuronide, present at steady state at 44% of the concentration of olanzapine, and 4´-N-desmethyl olanzapine, present at steady state at 31% of the concentration of olanzapine. Both metabolites lack pharmacological activity at the concentrations observed.</p><p>Direct glucuronidation and CYP450-mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies suggest that CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6-mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, because the clearance of olanzapine is not reduced in subjects who are deficient in this enzyme.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluoxetine</span> — Fluoxetine is a racemic mixture (50/50) of <span class="Italics">R</span>-fluoxetine and <span class="Italics">S</span>-fluoxetine enantiomers. In animal models, both enantiomers are specific and potent serotonin uptake inhibitors with essentially equivalent pharmacologic activity. The <span class="Italics">S</span>-fluoxetine enantiomer is eliminated more slowly and is the predominant enantiomer present in plasma at steady state.</p><p>Fluoxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver to its only identified active metabolite, norfluoxetine, via the CYP2D6 pathway. A number of unidentified metabolites exist.</p><p>In animal models, <span class="Italics">S</span>-norfluoxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake and has activity essentially equivalent to <span class="Italics">R</span>- or <span class="Italics">S</span>-fluoxetine. <span class="Italics">R</span>-norfluoxetine is significantly less potent than the parent drug in the inhibition of serotonin uptake. The primary route of elimination appears to be hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites excreted by the kidney.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Issues Related to Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p>The complexity of the metabolism of fluoxetine has several consequences that may potentially affect the clinical use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules.</p><p><span class="Italics">Variability in Metabolism</span> — A subset (about 7%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6. Such individuals are referred to as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). In a study involving labeled and unlabeled enantiomers administered as a racemate, these individuals metabolized <span class="Italics">S</span>-fluoxetine at a slower rate and thus achieved higher concentrations of <span class="Italics">S</span>-fluoxetine. Consequently, concentrations of <span class="Italics">S</span>-norfluoxetine at steady state were lower. The metabolism of <span class="Italics">R</span>-fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at steady state of the plasma concentrations of the 4 enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same. Alternative nonsaturable pathways (non-CYP2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine. This explains how fluoxetine achieves a steady-state concentration rather than increasing without limit.</p><p>Because the metabolism of fluoxetine, like that of a number of other compounds including TCAs and other selective serotonin antidepressants, involves the CYP2D6 system, concomitant therapy with drugs also metabolized by this enzyme system (such as the TCAs) may lead to drug interactions [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Accumulation and Slow Elimination</span> — The relatively slow elimination of fluoxetine (elimination half-life of 1 to 3 days after acute administration and 4 to 6 days after chronic administration) and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine (elimination half-life of 4 to 16 days after acute and chronic administration), leads to significant accumulation of these active species in chronic use and delayed attainment of steady state, even when a fixed dose is used. After 30 days of dosing at 40 mg/day, plasma concentrations of fluoxetine in the range of 91 to 302 ng/mL and norfluoxetine in the range of 72 to 258 ng/mL have been observed. Plasma concentrations of fluoxetine were higher than those predicted by single-dose studies, because the metabolism of fluoxetine is not proportional to dose. However, norfluoxetine appears to have linear pharmacokinetics. Its mean terminal half-life after a single dose was 8.6 days and after multiple dosing was 9.3 days. Steady-state levels after prolonged dosing are similar to levels seen at 4 to 5 weeks.</p><p>The long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine assure that, even when dosing is stopped, active drug substance will persist in the body for weeks (primarily depending on individual patient characteristics, previous dosing regimen, and length of previous therapy at discontinuation). This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine.</p><h3>Specific Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric</span> — Based on the individual pharmacokinetic profiles of olanzapine and fluoxetine, the pharmacokinetics of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules may be altered in geriatric patients. Caution should be used in dosing the elderly, especially if there are other factors that might additively influence drug metabolism and/or pharmacodynamic sensitivity.</p><p>In a study involving 24 healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of olanzapine was about 1.5 times greater in elderly subjects (≥65 years of age) than in non-elderly subjects (&lt;65 years of age).</p><p>The disposition of single doses of fluoxetine in healthy elderly subjects (≥65 years of age) did not differ significantly from that in younger normal subjects. However, given the long half-life and nonlinear disposition of the drug, a single-dose study is not adequate to rule out the possibility of altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly, particularly if they have systemic illness or are receiving multiple drugs for concomitant diseases. The effects of age upon the metabolism of fluoxetine have been investigated in 260 elderly but otherwise healthy depressed patients (≥60 years of age) who received 20 mg fluoxetine for 6 weeks. Combined fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine plasma concentrations were 209.3 ± 85.7 ng/mL at the end of 6 weeks. No unusual age-associated pattern of adverse reactions was observed in those elderly patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span> — The pharmacokinetics of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. However, olanzapine and fluoxetine individual pharmacokinetics do not differ significantly in patients with renal impairment. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule dosing adjustment based upon renal impairment is not routinely required.</p><p>Because olanzapine is highly metabolized before excretion and only 7% of the drug is excreted unchanged, renal dysfunction alone is unlikely to have a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of olanzapine were similar in patients with severe renal impairment and normal subjects, indicating that dosage adjustment based upon the degree of renal impairment is not required. In addition, olanzapine is not removed by dialysis. The effect of renal impairment on olanzapine metabolite elimination has not been studied.</p><p>In depressed patients on dialysis (N=12), fluoxetine administered as 20 mg once daily for 2 months produced steady-state fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations comparable with those seen in patients with normal renal function. While the possibility exists that renally excreted metabolites of fluoxetine may accumulate to higher levels in patients with severe renal dysfunction, use of a lower or less frequent dose is not routinely necessary in renally impaired patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span> — Based on the individual pharmacokinetic profiles of olanzapine and fluoxetine, the pharmacokinetics of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment. The lowest starting dose should be considered for patients with hepatic impairment [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.20</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Although the presence of hepatic impairment may be expected to reduce the clearance of olanzapine, a study of the effect of impaired liver function in subjects (N=6) with clinically significant cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classification A and B) revealed little effect on the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine.</p><p>As might be predicted from its primary site of metabolism, liver impairment can affect the elimination of fluoxetine. The elimination half-life of fluoxetine was prolonged in a study of cirrhotic patients, with a mean of 7.6 days compared with the range of 2 to 3 days seen in subjects without liver disease; norfluoxetine elimination was also delayed, with a mean duration of 12 days for cirrhotic patients compared with the range of 7 to 9 days in normal subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gender</span> — Clearance of olanzapine is approximately 30% lower in women than in men. There were, however, no apparent differences between men and women in effectiveness or adverse effects. Dosage modifications based on gender should not be needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Smoking Status</span> — Olanzapine clearance is about 40% higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, although dosage modifications are not routinely required.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race</span> — No olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> studies have shown that exposures to olanzapine are similar among Japanese, Chinese and Caucasians, especially after normalization for body weight differences. Dosage modifications for race, therefore, are not routinely required.</p><p><span class="Bold">Combined Effects</span> — The combined effects of age, smoking, and gender could lead to substantial pharmacokinetic differences in populations. The clearance of olanzapine in young smoking males, for example, may be 3 times higher than that in elderly nonsmoking females.

Exposures in pediatric patients with high body weight were similar to those previously observed in adults. Dose modifications based on body weight are not required.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or fertility studies were conducted with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules. The following data are based on findings in studies performed with the individual components, and all dose multiples (based on body surface area) reflect the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 12 mg olanzapine, or 50 mg fluoxetine in Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine</span> — Oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. Olanzapine was administered to mice in two 78-week studies at doses of 3, 10, and 30/20 mg/kg/day [equivalent to 1 to 12 times the MRHD based on  mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area] and 0.25, 2, and 8 mg/kg/day (equivalent to up to 3 times the oral MRHD based on  mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area). Rats were dosed for 2 years at doses of 0.25, 1, 2.5 and 4 mg/kg/day (males) and 0.25, 1, 4 and 8 mg/kg/day (females) (equivalent to up to 3 and 7 times the oral MRHD based on  mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area, respectively). The incidence of liver hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas was significantly increased in 1 mouse study in female mice at 3 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. These tumors were not increased in another mouse study in females dosed up to 12 times the daily oral MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area; in this study, there was a high incidence of early mortalities in males of the 30/20 mg/kg/day group. The incidence of mammary gland adenomas and adenocarcinomas was significantly increased in female mice dosed at ≥2 mg/kg/day and in female rats dosed at ≥4 mg/kg/day (1 and 3 times the oral MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area, respectively). Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that olanzapine elevated serum prolactin levels up to 4-fold in rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity study. An increase in mammary gland neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin-mediated. The relevance for human risk of the finding of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">5.22</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluoxetine</span> — The dietary administration of fluoxetine to rats and mice for 2 years at doses of up to 10 and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 2 and 1 times, respectively, the MRHD of 20 mg given to children based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area), produced no evidence of carcinogenicity. </p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine</span> — No evidence of genotoxic potential for olanzapine was found in the following tests: Ames reverse mutation test, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test in mice, the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes, induction of forward mutation test in mouse lymphoma cells, or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> sister chromatid exchange test in bone marrow of Chinese hamsters.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fluoxetine</span> — No evidence of genotoxic potential for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine was found in the following tests: bacterial mutation assay, DNA repair assay in cultured rat hepatocytes, mouse lymphoma assay, and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamster bone marrow cells.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules</span> — Fertility studies were not conducted with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules.

Doses evaluated in these studies ranged from 6 to 18 mg for olanzapine and 25 to 50 mg for fluoxetine.</p><p>An 8-week randomized, double-blind controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules in patients (n=300) who met DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and did not respond to 2 different antidepressants after at least 6 weeks at or above the minimally effective labeled dosage in their current episode. Patients who were not responding to an antidepressant in their current episode entered an 8-week open-label fluoxetine lead-in; non-responders were randomized (1:1:1) to receive Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules, olanzapine, or fluoxetine, and were treated for 8 weeks. Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules were flexibly dosed between 6/50 mg, 12/50 mg, and 18/50 mg. Results from this study yielded statistically significant greater reduction in mean total MADRS scores from baseline to endpoint for Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules versus fluoxetine and olanzapine. See Table 19 (Study 4). A second study with the same treatment-resistant patient population (n=28), when analyzed with change in MADRS as the outcome measure, demonstrated statistically significantly greater reduction in MADRS scores for Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules versus fluoxetine and olanzapine. See <span class="Bold">Table 19</span> (Study 5). A third study demonstrated statistically significantly greater reduction in total MADRS scores for Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Capsules versus fluoxetine or olanzapine alone, when analyzed in a subpopulation of depressed patients (n=251) who met the definition of treatment resistance (patients who had not responded to 2 antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode).
