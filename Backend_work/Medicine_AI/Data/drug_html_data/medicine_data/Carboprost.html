Prostaglandins help to control functions in the body such as blood pressure and muscle contractions.</p><p>Carboprost is used to treat severe bleeding after childbirth (postpartum).</p><p>Carboprost is also used to produce an abortion by causing uterine contractions. It is usually given between the 13th and 20th weeks of pregnancy, but may be given at other times for medical reasons. Carboprost is often used when another method of abortion has not completely emptied the uterus, or when a complication of pregnancy would cause the baby to be born too early to survive.</p><p>Carboprost may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive  carboprost if you have active pelvic inflammatory disease, a breathing disorder, heart disease, liver disease, or kidney disease.</p><p>This medicine in given in a hospital or clinic setting to quickly treat any serious side effects that occur.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive carboprost if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>
