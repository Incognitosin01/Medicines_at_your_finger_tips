The active ingredient, tiamulin, chemically is 14-desoxy-14-[(2-diethylaminoethyl) mercaptoacetoxy] mutilin hydrogen fumarate, a semi-synthetic diterpene antibiotic. Denagard Liquid Concentrate is for use only in preparing medicated drinking water for swine.</p><h2>Actions:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tiamulin is active against <span class="Italics">Brachyspira</span><span class="Italics"> </span>(formerly <span class="Italics">Serpulina</span><span class="Italics"> </span>or<span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Treponema</span>) <span class="Italics">hyodysenteriae</span><span class="Italics"> </span>and <span class="Italics">Actinobacillus</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">pleuropneumoniae</span><span class="Italics">.</span> It is readily absorbed from the gut and can be found in the blood within 30 minutes after dosing.</span></p><h2>Indications:</h2><p class="First">Denagard (tiamulin), when administered in the drinking water for five consecutive days, is an effective antibiotic for the treatment of swine dysentery associated with <span class="Italics">Brachyspira</span><span class="Italics"> </span>(formerly <span class="Italics">Serpulina</span><span class="Italics"> </span>or<span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Treponema</span>) <span class="Italics">hyodysenteriae</span><span class="Italics"> </span>susceptible to tiamulin at a dose level of 3.5 mg tiamulin hydrogen fumarate per pound of body weight daily and for treatment of swine pneumonia due to <span class="Italics">Actinobacillus</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">pleuropneumoniae</span><span class="Italics"> </span>susceptible to tiamulin when given at 10.5 mg tiamulin hydrogen fumarate per pound of body weight daily.</p><h2>Contraindications:</h2><p class="First">Swine being treated with Denagard (tiamulin) should not have access to feeds containing polyether ionophores (e.g., monensin, lasalocid, narasin, salinomycin and semduramicin) as adverse reactions may occur.</p><h2>Warning:</h2><p class="First">Keep out of reach of children.<span class="Bold"> </span>Avoid contact with skin. Direct contact with skin or mucous membranes may cause irritation.</p><p>Withdraw medicated water 3 days before slaughter after treatment at 3.5 mg per pound and 7 days before slaughter following treatment at 10.5 mg per pound body weight.</p><h2>Caution:</h2><p class="First">For use in drinking water of swine only. Prepare fresh medicated water daily. The effects of tiamulin on swine reproductive performance, pregnancy and lactation have not been determined. For animal use only – not for use in humans.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions:</h2><p class="First">Overdoses of Denagard have sometimes produced transitory salivation, vomiting and an apparent calming effect on the pig. If signs of toxicity occur, discontinue use of medicated water and replace with clean, fresh water.</p><p>In rare cases, redness of the skin primarily over the ham and underline has been observed during medication. If these signs appear, discontinue use of this drug. Provide ample clean drinking water. Thoroughly rinse (hose down) the housing to remove urine and feces from animal contact surfaces or move the animals to clean pens. If the condition persists, consult your veterinarian.</p><p>Studies to evaluate the safety of the water soluble form of tiamulin in breeding swine have not been done.</p><h2>Use Directions:</h2><p class="First">The concentration of tiamulin in the drinking water must be adjusted to compensate for variation in water consumption due to weight or size of the pig, environmental temperature and other factors. It is important that pigs receive the proper drug dose, 3.5 mg tiamulin hydrogen fumarate per pound for swine dysentery or 10.5 mg tiamulin hydrogen fumarate per pound for swine pneumonia, each day for 5 consecutive days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note</span><span class="Bold">:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Directions for preparing</span> <span class="Bold">Denagard</span> <span class="Bold">medicated solutions</span><span class="Bold">:</span> Determine the amount of Denagard Liquid Concentrate needed to medicate the desired volume of drinking water at the proper concentration.

The concentration of tiamulin hydrogen fumarate in the stock solution and in the drinking water delivered must be adjusted to compensate for variation in water consumption by pigs due to body weight, environmental and other factors. It is important that the pigs receive the proper drug dose of 3.5 mg of tiamulin hydrogen fumarate per pound of body weight daily for 5 consecutive days for treatment of swine dysentery or a dose of 10.5 mg per pound body weight daily for 5 consecutive days for treatment of swine pneumonia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Attention:</span> If no response to treatment is obtained within 5 days re-establish the diagnosis. Failure of response may be related to the presence of non-susceptible organisms of other complicating disease conditions. Because of the tendency for the disease to recur on premises with a history of swine dysentery or with swine pneumonia, a control program should be implemented after treatment. Drugs are not substitutes for proper sanitary measures or good management, but should be used in conjunction with such practices.</p><h2>How supplied:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Protect from direct sunlight.</span> Store at controlled room temperature, 59°-86°F (15°-30°C).</p><p><span class="Bold">Observe expiration date.</span></p><p>U.S. Patent No. 4,278,674</p><h2>Principal Display Panel</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Denagard</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">(</span><span class="Bold">tiamulin</span><span class="Bold">)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Liquid Concentrate</span></p><p><span class="Bold">12.3%</span> <span class="Bold">Tiamulin</span></p><p><span class="Bold">hydrogen</span> <span class="Bold">fumarate</span></p><p><span class="Bold">NADA 140-916,</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Approved by FDA</span></p><p><span class="Bold">One Quart</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(</span><span class="Bold">32 fl oz; 946</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">mL</span><span class="Bold">)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">NOVARTIS</span></p><p><span class="Bold">ANIMAL HEALTH</span></p><p></p><p class="ddc-disclaimer-link">Medical Disclaimer</p></body></html>
