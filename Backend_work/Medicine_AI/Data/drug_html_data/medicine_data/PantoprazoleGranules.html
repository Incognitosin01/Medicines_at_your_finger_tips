</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Pantoprazole Granules</h2><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is indicated for:</p><h3>Short-Term Treatment of Erosive Esophagitis Associated With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is indicated in adults and pediatric patients five years of age and older for the short-term treatment (up to 8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic relief of erosive esophagitis (EE). For those adult patients who have not healed after 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 8-week course of pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension may be considered. Safety of treatment beyond 8 weeks in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><h3>Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is indicated for maintenance of healing of EE and reduction in relapse rates of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms in adult patients with GERD. Controlled studies did not extend beyond 12 months.</p><h3>Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions Including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is indicated for the long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome.</p><h2>Pantoprazole Granules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosing Schedule</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium is supplied as delayed-release granules in packets for preparation of oral suspensions. The recommended dosages are outlined in Table 1.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Table 1: Recommended Dosing Schedule for Pantoprazole Sodium for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension<br/></span></p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Directions for method of administration are presented in Table 2.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Administration Instructions</span></p><p>* Do not split, chew, or crush Pantoprazole Sodium for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension.</p><p>Take a missed dose as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular scheduled time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.</p><p>Administer pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension approximately 30 minutes prior to a meal via oral administration in apple juice or applesauce or nasogastric tube in apple juice only. Because proper pH is necessary for stability, do not administer pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension in liquids other than apple juice, or foods other than applesauce.</p><p>Do not divide the 40 mg pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension packet to create a 20 mg dosage for pediatric patients who are unable to take the tablet formulation.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Pantoprazole Sodium for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension - Oral Administration in Applesauce</span></p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><p><span class="Bold">Pantoprazole Sodium for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension - Nasogastric (NG) Tube or Gastrostomy Tube Administration</span></p><p>For patients who have a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube in place, pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension can be given as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Remove the plunger from the barrel of a 2 ounce (60 mL) catheter-tip syringe. Discard the plunger.</li>
<li>Connect the catheter tip of the syringe to a 16 French (or larger) tube.</li>
<li>Hold the syringe attached to the tubing as high as possible while giving pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension to prevent any bending of the tubing.</li>
<li>Empty the contents of the packet into the barrel of the syringe.</li>
</ul><p>Add 10 mL (2 teaspoonfuls) of apple juice and gently tap and/or shake the barrel of the syringe to help rinse the syringe and tube. Repeat at least twice more using the same amount of apple juice (10 mL or 2 teaspoonfuls) each time. No granules should remain in the syringe.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>40 mg pantoprazole, pale yellowish to dark brownish, enteric-coated granules in a unit-dose packet</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation or any substituted benzimidazole. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urticaria <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></li>
<li>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension, are contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Presence of Gastric Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.</p><h3>Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis</span> (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First">Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.</p><p>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</p><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</p><p>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving pantoprazole, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</p><h3>Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed.</p><h3>Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.</p><p>For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Tumorigenicity</h3><p class="First">Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Fundic Gland Polyps</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy</span> appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h3>Interference with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p class="First">Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Interference with Urine Screen for THC</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs, including pantoprazole <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate</h3><p class="First">Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">The adverse reaction profiles for pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are similar.</p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another PPI, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.</p><p>Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in clinical trials with a frequency of ≤ 2% are listed below by body system:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> allergic reaction, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic:</span> leukopenia, thrombocytopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic/Nutritional:</span> elevated CK (creatine kinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver enzymes elevated</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> myalgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous:</span> depression, vertigo</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span> urticaria, rash, pruritus</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> blurred vision</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients </span></p><p>Safety of pantoprazole in the treatment of EE associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (&gt;4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.</p><p>For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>.</p><p>Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of ≤ 4% are listed below by body system:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> allergic reaction, facial edema</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> constipation, flatulence, nausea</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic/Nutritional:</span> elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase)</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> arthralgia, myalgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous:</span> dizziness, vertigo</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span> urticaria</p><p>The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision.</p><p><span class="Bold">Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome</span></p><p>In clinical studies of ZE Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole.

</ul><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span> Available data from published observational studies did not demonstrate an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with pantoprazole.<br/>
In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse development outcomes was observed with pantoprazole. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (about 88 times the recommended human dose) and rabbits at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (about 16 times the recommended human dose) with administration of pantoprazole during organogenesis in pregnant animals and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to pantoprazole in this study (see Data).<br/>
A pre-and postnatal development toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate the effect on bone development was performed with pantoprazole sodium. Oral pantoprazole doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day) were administered to pregnant females from gestation day (GD) 6 through lactation day (LD) 21. Changes in bone morphology were observed in pups exposed to pantoprazole in utero and through milk during the period of lactation as well as by oral dosing from postnatal day (PND) 4 through PND 21 <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>. There were no drug-related findings in maternal animals. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal harm.<br/>
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Data<br/></span> <span class="Italics">Human Data<br/></span> Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a Relative Risk (RR)=0.55, [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.08-3.95]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR=1.12 ([95% CI 0.86-1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR=1.29 [95% CI 0.84-1.97]).<br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal Data<br/></span> Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral pantoprazole doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (about 88 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (about 16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) with administration of pantoprazole sodium during organogenesis in pregnant animals. The studies have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to pantoprazole.<br/>
A pre-and postnatal development toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate the effect on bone development was performed with pantoprazole sodium. Oral pantoprazole doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) were administered to pregnant females from gestation day (GD) 6 through lactation day (LD) 21. On postnatal day (PND 4) through PND 21, the pups were administered oral doses at 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 2.3, and 3.2 times the exposure (AUC) in humans at a dose of 40 mg). There were no drug-related findings in maternal animals. During the preweaning dosing phase (PND 4 to 21) of the pups, there were increased mortality and/or moribundity and decreased body weight and body weight gain at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans receiving the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. On PND 21, decreased mean femur length and weight and changes in femur bone mass and geometry were observed in the offspring at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. The femur findings included lower total area, bone mineral content and density, periosteal and endosteal circumference, and cross-sectional moment of inertia. There were no microscopic changes in the distal femur, proximal tibia, or stifle joints. Changes in bone parameters were partially reversible following a recovery period, with findings on PND 70 limited to lower femur metaphysis cortical/subcortical bone mineral density in female pups at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses.<br/></p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span> Pantoprazole has been detected in breast milk of a nursing mother after a single 40 mg oral dose of pantoprazole. There were no effects on the breastfed infant (see Data). There are no data on pantoprazole effects on milk production.<br/>
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for pantoprazole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from pantoprazole or from the underlying maternal condition.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Data<br/></span> The breast milk of a 42-year-old woman receiving 40 mg of oral pantoprazole, at 10 months postpartum, was studied for 24 hours, to demonstrate low levels of pantoprazole present in the breast milk. Pantoprazole was detectable in milk only 2 and 4 hours after the dose with milk levels of approximately 36 mcg/L and 24 mcg/L, respectively. A milk-to-plasma ratio of 0.022 was observed at 2 hours after drug administration. Pantoprazole was not detectable (&lt;10 mcg/L) in milk at 6, 8 and 24 hours after the dose. The relative dose to the infant was estimated to be 7.3 mcg of pantoprazole, which is equivalent to 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. No adverse events in the infant were reported by the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of EE associated with GERD have been established in pediatric patients 1 year through 16 years of age. Effectiveness for EE has not been demonstrated in patients less than 1 year of age. In addition, for patients less than 5 years of age, there is no appropriate dosage strength in an age-appropriate formulation available. Therefore, pantoprazole is indicated for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD for patients 5 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole for pediatric uses other than EE have not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">1 year through 16 years of age</span></p><p>Use of pantoprazole in pediatric patients 1 year through 16 years of age for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of EE associated with GERD is supported by: a) extrapolation of results from adequate and well-controlled studies that supported the approval of pantoprazole for treatment of EE associated with GERD in adults, and b) safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetic studies performed in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Safety of pantoprazole in the treatment of EE associated with GERD in pediatric patients 1 through 16 years of age was evaluated in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment studies, involving 249 pediatric patients, including 8 with EE (4 patients ages 1 year to 5 years and 4 patients 5 years to 11 years). The children ages 1 year to 5 years with endoscopically diagnosed EE (defined as an endoscopic Hetzel-Dent score ≥ 2) were treated once daily for 8 weeks with one of two dose levels of pantoprazole (approximating 0.6 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg). All 4 of these patients with EE were healed (Hetzel-Dent score of 0 or 1) at 8 weeks. Because EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, predominantly pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also included in these studies. Patients were treated with a range of doses of pantoprazole once daily for 8 weeks. For safety findings see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>. Because these pediatric trials had no placebo, active comparator, or evidence of a dose response, the trials were inconclusive regarding the clinical benefit of pantoprazole for symptomatic GERD in the pediatric population. The effectiveness of pantoprazole for treating symptomatic GERD in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><p>Although the data from the clinical trials support use of pantoprazole for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD in pediatric patients 1 year through 5 years, there is no commercially available dosage formulation appropriate for patients less than 5 years of age [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2)</span>].</p><p>In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, clearance values in the children 1 to 5 years old with endoscopically proven GERD had a median value of 2.4 L/h. Following a 1.2 mg/kg equivalent dose (15 mg for ≤ 12.5 kg and 20 mg for &gt; 12.5 to &lt; 25 kg), the plasma concentrations of pantoprazole were highly variable and the median time to peak plasma concentration was 3 to 6 hours. The estimated AUC for patients 1 to 5 years old was 37% higher than for adults receiving a single 40 mg tablet, with a geometric mean AUC value of 6.8 mcg•hr/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Neonates to less than one year of age</span></p><p>Pantoprazole was not found to be effective in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment-withdrawal study of 129 pediatric patients 1 through 11 months of age. Patients were enrolled if they had symptomatic GERD based on medical history and had not responded to non-pharmacologic interventions for GERD for two weeks. Patients received pantoprazole daily for four weeks in an open-label phase, then patients were randomized in equal proportion to receive pantoprazole treatment or placebo for the subsequent four weeks in a double-blind manner. Efficacy was assessed by observing the time from randomization to study discontinuation due to symptom worsening during the four-week treatment-withdrawal phase. There was no statistically significant difference between pantoprazole and placebo in the rate of discontinuation.</p><p>In this trial, the adverse reactions that were reported more commonly (difference of ≥ 4%) in the treated population compared to the placebo population were elevated CK, otitis media, rhinitis, and laryngitis.</p><p>In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the systemic exposure was higher in patients less than 1 year of age with GERD compared to adults who received a single 40 mg dose (geometric mean AUC was 103% higher in preterm infants and neonates receiving single dose of 2.5 mg of pantoprazole, and 23% higher in infants 1 through 11 months of age receiving a single dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg). In these patients, the apparent clearance (CL/F) increased with age (median clearance: 0.6 L/hr, range: 0.03 to 3.2 L/hr).</p><p>These doses resulted in pharmacodynamic effects on gastric but not esophageal pH. Following once daily dosing of 2.5 mg of pantoprazole in preterm infants and neonates, there was an increase in the mean gastric pH (from 4.3 at baseline to 5.2 at steady-state) and in the mean % time that gastric pH was &gt; 4 (from 60% at baseline to 80% at steady-state). Following once daily dosing of approximately 1.2 mg/kg of pantoprazole in infants 1 through 11 months of age, there was an increase in the mean gastric pH (from 3.1 at baseline to 4.2 at steady-state) and in the mean % time that gastric pH was &gt; 4 (from 32% at baseline to 60% at steady-state). However, no significant changes were observed in mean intraesophageal pH or % time that esophageal pH was &lt; 4 in either age group.</p><p>Because pantoprazole was not shown to be effective in the randomized, placebo-controlled study in this age group, the use of pantoprazole for treatment of symptomatic GERD in infants less than 1 year of age is not indicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Animal Toxicity Data</span></p><p>In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, the pups were administered oral doses of pantoprazole at 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 2.3, and 3.2 times the exposure (AUC) in children aged 6 to 11 years at a dose of 40 mg) on postnatal day (PND 4) through PND 21, in addition to lactational exposure through milk. On PND 21, decreased mean femur length and weight and changes in femur bone mass and geometry were observed in the offspring at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in children aged 6 to 11 years at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. Changes in bone parameters were partially reversible following a recovery period.</p><p>In neonatal/juvenile animals (rats and dogs) toxicities were similar to those observed in adult animals, including gastric alterations, decreases in red cell mass, increases in lipids, enzyme induction and hepatocellular hypertrophy. An increased incidence of eosinophilic chief cells in adult and neonatal/juvenile rats, and atrophy of chief cells in adult rats and in neonatal/juvenile dogs, was observed in the fundic mucosa of stomachs in repeated-dose studies. Full to partial recovery of these effects were noted in animals of both age groups following a recovery period.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In short-term US clinical trials, EE healing rates in the 107 elderly patients (≥ 65 years old) treated with pantoprazole were similar to those found in patients under the age of 65. The incidence rates of adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in patients aged 65 years and older were similar to those associated with patients younger than 65 years of age.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Experience in patients taking very high doses of pantoprazole (greater than 240 mg) is limited. Spontaneous postmarketing reports of overdose are generally within the known safety profile of pantoprazole.</p><p>Pantoprazole is not removed by hemodialysis. In case of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.</p><p>Single oral doses of pantoprazole at 709 mg/kg, 798 mg/kg, and 887 mg/kg were lethal to mice, rats, and dogs, respectively. The symptoms of acute toxicity were hypoactivity, ataxia, hunched sitting, limb-splay, lateral position, segregation, absence of ear reflex, and tremor.</p><p>If overexposure to pantoprazole occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.</p><h2>Pantoprazole Granules Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension, a PPI, is a substituted benzimidazole, sodium 5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-[[(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]­-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-benzimidazole sesquihydrate, a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion.

The structural formula is:</p><p>Pantoprazole sodium USP, (sesquihydrate) is a white to off-white crystalline powder and is racemic. Pantoprazole has weakly basic and acidic properties. Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is freely soluble in water, very slightly soluble in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, and practically insoluble in n-hexane.</p><p>The stability of the compound in aqueous solution is pH-dependent. The rate of degradation increases with decreasing pH. At ambient temperature, the degradation half-life is approximately 2.8 hours at pH 5 and approximately 220 hours at pH 7.8.</p><p>Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is supplied as a for delayed-release oral suspension in unit-dose packets available in one strength 40 mg pantoprazole, (equivalent to 45.1 mg of pantoprazole sodium),  contains the following inactive ingredients: calcium stearate, crospovidone, ferric oxide yellow, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polysorbate 80, povidone, sodium carbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate.</p><h2>Pantoprazole Granules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole is a PPI that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H<span class="Sup">+</span>, K<span class="Sup">+</span>)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H<span class="Sup">+</span>, K<span class="Sup">+</span>)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension, 40 mg has been shown to be comparable to pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets in suppressing pentagastrin-stimulated MAO in patients (n = 49) with GERD and a history of EE. In this multicenter, pharmacodynamic crossover study, a 40 mg oral dose of pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension administered in a teaspoonful of applesauce was compared with a 40 mg oral dose of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets after administration of each formulation once daily for 7 days. Both medications were administered thirty minutes before breakfast. Pentagastrin-stimulated (MAO) was assessed from hour 23 to 24 at steady state.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antisecretory Activity</span></p><p>Under maximal acid stimulatory conditions using pentagastrin, a dose-dependent decrease in gastric acid output occurs after a single dose of oral (20 mg to 80 mg) or a single dose of intravenous (20 mg to 120 mg) pantoprazole in healthy subjects. Pantoprazole given once daily results in increasing inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Following the initial oral dose of 40 mg pantoprazole, a 51% mean inhibition was achieved by 2.5 hours. With once-a-day dosing for 7 days, the mean inhibition was increased to 85%. Pantoprazole suppressed acid secretion in excess of 95% in half of the subjects. Acid secretion had returned to normal within a week after the last dose of pantoprazole; there was no evidence of rebound hypersecretion.</p><p>In a series of dose-response studies, pantoprazole, at oral doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg, caused dose-related increases in median basal gastric pH and in the percent of time gastric pH was &gt;3 and &gt;4. Treatment with 40 mg of pantoprazole produced significantly greater increases in gastric pH than the 20 mg dose. Doses higher than 40 mg (60, 80, 120 mg) did not result in further significant increases in median gastric pH. The effects of pantoprazole on median pH from one double-blind crossover study are shown in Table 5.</p><p><span class="Bold">Serum Gastrin Effects</span></p><p>Fasting serum gastrin levels were assessed in two double-blind studies of the acute healing of EE in which 682 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) received 10, 20, or 40 mg of pantoprazole for up to 8 weeks. At 4 weeks of treatment there was an increase in mean gastrin levels of 7%, 35%, and 72% over pretreatment values in the 10, 20, and 40 mg treatment groups, respectively. A similar increase in serum gastrin levels was noted at the 8-week visit with mean increases of 3%, 26%, and 84% for the three pantoprazole dose groups. Median serum gastrin levels remained within normal limits during maintenance therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets.</p><p>In long-term international studies involving over 800 patients, a 2- to 3-fold mean increase from the pretreatment fasting serum gastrin level was observed in the initial months of treatment with pantoprazole at doses of 40 mg per day during GERD maintenance studies and 40 mg or higher per day in patients with refractory GERD. Fasting serum gastrin levels generally remained at approximately 2 to 3 times baseline for up to 4 years of periodic follow-up in clinical trials.</p><p>Following short-term treatment with pantoprazole, elevated gastrin levels return to normal by at least 3 months.</p><p><span class="Bold">Enterochromaffin-Like (ECL) Cell Effects</span></p><p>In 39 patients treated with oral pantoprazole 40 mg to 240 mg daily (majority receiving 40 mg to 80 mg) for up to 5 years, there was a moderate increase in ECL-cell density, starting after the first year of use, which appeared to plateau after 4 years.</p><p>In a nonclinical study in Sprague-Dawley rats, lifetime exposure (24 months) to pantoprazole at doses of 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day resulted in dose-related increases in gastric ECL-cell proliferation and gastric neuroendocrine (NE)-cell tumors. Gastric NE-cell tumors in rats may result from chronic elevation of serum gastrin concentrations. The high density of ECL cells in the rat stomach makes this species highly susceptible to the proliferative effects of elevated gastrin concentrations produced by PPIs. However, there were no observed elevations in serum gastrin following the administration of pantoprazole at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day. In a separate study, a gastric NE-cell tumor without concomitant ECL-cell proliferative changes was observed in 1 female rat following 12 months of dosing with pantoprazole at 5 mg/kg/day and a 9 month off-dose recovery <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Endocrine Effects</span></p><p>In a clinical pharmacology study, pantoprazole 40 mg given once daily for 2 weeks had no effect on the levels of the following hormones: cortisol, testosterone, triiodothyronine (T<span class="Sub">3</span>), thyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyronine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and growth hormone.</p><p>In a 1year study of GERD patients treated with pantoprazole 40 mg or 20 mg, there were no changes from baseline in overall levels of T<span class="Sub">3</span>, T<span class="Sub">4</span>, and TSH.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are prepared as enteric-coated tablets so that absorption of pantoprazole begins only after the tablet leaves the stomach. Peak serum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) increase in a manner proportional to oral and intravenous doses from 10 mg to 80 mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate, and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing.

Four pediatric patients with endoscopically diagnosed EE were studied in multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment trials. Children with endoscopically diagnosed EE (defined as an endoscopic Hetzel-Dent score ≥ 2) were treated once daily for 8 weeks with one of two dose levels of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets (20 mg or 40 mg). All 4 patients with EE were healed (Hetzel-Dent score of 0 or 1) at 8 weeks.</p><h3>Long-Term Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis</h3><p class="First">Two independent, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled trials of identical design were conducted in adult GERD patients with endoscopically confirmed healed EE to demonstrate efficacy of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets in long-term maintenance of healing. The two US studies enrolled 386 and 404 patients, respectively, to receive either 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily or 150 mg of ranitidine twice daily. As demonstrated in Table 10, pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets 40 mg and 20 mg were significantly superior to ranitidine at every timepoint with respect to the maintenance of healing. In addition, pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablet 40 mg was superior to all other treatments studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 10: Long-Term Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD Maintenance): Percentage of Patients Who Remained Healed</span></p><p>* (p &lt; 0.05 vs. ranitidine)</p><p># (p &lt; 0.05 vs. pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets 20 mg)</p><p>Note: Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets 10 mg was superior (p &lt; 0.05) to ranitidine in Study 2, but not Study 1.</p><p>Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablet 40 mg was superior to ranitidine in reducing the number of daytime and nighttime heartburn episodes from the first through the twelfth month of treatment.
