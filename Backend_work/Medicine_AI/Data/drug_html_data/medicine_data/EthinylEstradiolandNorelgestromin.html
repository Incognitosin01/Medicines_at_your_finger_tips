The follicular phase FSH and midcycle surge of gonadotropins are inhibited. In addition, combination hormonal contraceptives produce alterations in the genital tract, including changes in the cervical mucus, rendering it unfavorable for sperm penetration even if ovulation occurs. Changes in the endometrium may also occur, producing an unfavorable environment for nidation. Combination hormonal contraceptive drugs may alter the tubal transport of the ova through the fallopian tubes. Progestational agents may also alter sperm fertility.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Topical: Equivalent when applied to abdomen, buttock, upper outer arm, and upper torso</p><p>Ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin: Rapid; reaches plateau by ~48 hours. Absorption of ethinyl estradiol may be increased with heat exposure due to sauna, whirlpool, or treadmill.</p><p>The AUC plasma concentration of ethinyl estradiol at steady state is ~60% higher following use of the patch than with those observed following an oral 35 mcg tablet.

Each patch should be applied on the same day each week (“patch change day”) and only one patch should be worn at a time. No more than 7 days should pass during the patch-free interval.</p><p>Schedule 1 (Sunday starter): Dose begins on first Sunday after onset of menstruation; if the menstrual period starts on Sunday, apply one patch that very same day. <b>With a Sunday start, an additional method of contraception (nonhormonal) must be used until after the first 7 days of consecutive administration unless the menstrual period starts on Sunday.</b> Each patch change will then occur on Sunday.</p><p>Schedule 2 (Day 1 starter): Dose starts on first day of menstrual cycle, applying one patch during the first 24 hours of menstrual cycle. Each patch change will then occur on that same day of the week.</p><p>Additional dosing considerations:</p><p>Switching from oral contraceptives or vaginal ring: Complete current cycle and apply the first patch on the day the next pill cycle would be started or ring would be inserted. If there is no menstrual bleeding within 7 days of taking the last active tablet or removing the last vaginal ring, the patient can initiate the first patch application; however, assess pregnancy status. If patch is applied later than 7 days after the last active pill or removal of the vaginal ring, <b>an additional method of contraception (nonhormonal) should be used until after the first 7 days of consecutive administration</b></p><p>Use after childbirth: Therapy should not be started &lt;4 weeks after childbirth. Pregnancy should be ruled out prior to treatment if menstrual periods have not restarted. <b>An additional method of contraception (nonhormonal) should be used until after the first 7 days of consecutive administration.</b></p><p>Use after abortion or miscarriage: Therapy may be started immediately if abortion/miscarriage occurs within the first trimester. If therapy is not started within 5 days, follow instructions for first time use; an additional method of contraception (nonhormonal) should be used until after the first 7 days of consecutive administration. If abortion/miscarriage occurs during the second trimester, therapy should not be started for at least 4 weeks. Follow directions for use after childbirth.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p>Females: Contraception: Topical: Refer to adult dosing; not to be used prior to menarche.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>New patches should be applied on the same day each week. Apply to clean, dry, intact, healthy skin on the buttock, abdomen, upper outer arm, or back. Avoid areas that will be rubbed by tight clothing. Do not apply to the breasts or to skin that is red, irritated, or cut. Alternate application sites; do not apply to the same place as the previous patch. Do not apply make-up, creams, lotions, powders, or other topical products to the skin where the patch will be placed. Remove the patch and the plastic liner from the foil pouch, being careful not to remove the clear liner when removing the patch. Apply patch by first peeling back half of the clear protective liner. Avoid touching surface of patch. Apply patch to skin and remove the rest of the liner. Press patch down firmly onto skin using palm of the hand; apply pressure for 10 seconds. Run fingers over entire surface area to smooth out any wrinkles in the patch. The patch should be checked daily to ensure all edges are sticking. When changing the patch each week, the new patch may be applied in the same anatomic area but should be applied to a new spot in that area. Do not use supplemental adhesives or wraps to hold patch into place. Do not cut, damage or alter the size of the patch; contraceptive efficacy may be impaired.</p><p>If a patch becomes partially or completely detached for &lt;24 hours: Try to reapply to same place or replace with a new patch immediately. Do not reapply if patch is no longer sticky, if it is sticking to itself or another surface, or if it has material sticking to it.</p><p>If a patch becomes partially or completely detached for &gt;24 hours (or time period is unknown): Apply a new patch and use this day of the week as the new “patch change day” from this point on. <b>An additional method of contraception (nonhormonal) must be used until after the first 7 days of consecutive administration.</b></p><p>Forgetting to apply the patch at the start of cycle (week 1/day 1): Apply first patch as soon as remembering, using this day of the week as the new “patch change day” from this point on. An additional method of contraception (nonhormonal) must be used until after the first 7 days of consecutive administration.</p><p>Forgetting to change patch in the middle of the cycle (week 2/day 8 or week 3/day 15): If &lt;48 hours from normal “patch change day,” apply new patch immediately. No back-up contraception is needed. If &gt;48 hours from normal “patch change day,” apply a new patch and use this day of the week as the new “patch change day” from this point on. An additional method of contraception (nonhormonal) must be used until after the first 7 days of consecutive administration.</p><p>Forgetting to remove patch at end of cycle (week 4/day 22): Take off as soon as remembering, start new cycle on usual “patch change day.”</p><p>Changing the “patch change day”: The “patch change day” can be changed to an earlier day in the week by first completing the current cycle. Then, during the “patch-free interval”, select an earlier day to start the new cycle. Shortening the patch free interval may increase the incidence of spotting or breakthrough bleeding. Do not allow &gt;7 consecutive patch-free days.</p><p>Skin irritation: If patch is in an uncomfortable location, it can be removed and a new patch applied to a different location until the next “patch change day.”</p><p>To dispose of patch, fold the sticky sides together and dispose in the trash within a child-resistant container. Do not flush down the toilet.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at controlled room temperature of 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); do not refrigerate or freeze.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Acitretin: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Progestins (Contraceptive).

This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination hormonal contraceptives, including norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol, are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.</p><p>Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The risk of venous thromboembolism may be greater with norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol in women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>compared to women with a lower BMI.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Breast cancer: In women at risk for breast cancer due to family history or susceptibility genes (<i>BRCA1, BRCA2</i>), the use of combination hormonal contraceptives has not been shown to modify the risk for breast cancer. However, breast cancer is a hormonal sensitive tumor and the prognosis for women with a current or recent history of breast cancer may be worse with combination hormonal contraceptive use (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in women with (or history of) breast cancer.</p><p>• Cervical cancer: The use of combination hormonal contraceptives has been associated with a slight increased risk of cervical cancer; however, studies are not consistent and may be related to additional risk factors (Gierisch 2013). Theoretically, use may affect prognosis of existing disease. Women awaiting treatment for cervical cancer may use combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Chloasma: Combination hormonal contraceptives, as well as sun exposure and pregnancy, are triggers for chloasma. Women with a susceptibility to chloasma or additional risk factors should avoid exposure to sun or ultraviolet radiation during therapy (Handel 2014).</p><p>• Cholestasis: Risk of cholestasis may be increased with previous cholestasis of pregnancy or cholestasis with prior oral contraceptive use.</p><p>• Lipid effects: Combination hormonal contraceptives may adversely affect lipid levels, including serum triglycerides. Women with hypertriglyceridemia or a family history of hypertriglyceridemia may be at increased risk of pancreatitis when using combination hormonal contraceptives. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia.</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: Discontinue if unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions occur and immediately evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis.</p><p>• Thromboembolic disorders: Higher estrogen exposure may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including venous thromboembolism (VTE). The AUC for ethinyl estradiol is ~60% higher following use of the patch than with oral tablets containing ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Peak concentrations are lower with the patch. Discontinue use of combination hormonal contraceptives if an arterial or venous thromboembolic event occurs. May increase the risk of VTE (risk is greatest during first year of use and less than the risk associated with pregnancy); some studies suggest this risk may be higher in preparations with third- or fourth-generation progestins and/or high-dose ethinyl estradiol. Women with inherited thrombophilias (eg, protein C or S deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin mutation, antithrombin deficiency) may have increased risk of VTE. Age &gt;35 years, hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use also increase the risk of thromboembolic events in women taking combination hormonal contraceptives (ASRM 2017; Curtis 2016b; DeSancho 2010; van Vlijmen 2011). Combination hormonal contraceptives may also increase the risk of arterial thrombosis (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) and should not be used in women with a history of stroke or ischemic heart disease (Curtis 2016b). Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated in women with a high risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events.</p><p>• Vaginal bleeding: Breakthrough or intracyclic bleeding and spotting may occur, especially during the first 3 months of therapy. In addition, occasional missed periods may occur. Presentation of irregular, unresolving vaginal bleeding warrants further evaluation to rule out malignancy or pregnancy. Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur after discontinuing combination hormonal contraceptives, especially when such a condition was preexistent.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Bariatric surgery:</p><p>– Altered absorption: Consider nonoral contraceptive options in patients who had specific bariatric procedures (Roux-en-Y, biliopancreatic diversion); malabsorptive procedures can potentially decrease absorption of oral contraceptives (Kominiarek 2017; Mechanick 2013; Schlatter 2017). It is difficult to recommend against the use of oral contraceptives in restrictive procedures (sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding) as the evidence is limited (Merki-Feld 2015).</p><p>–­ Venous thromboembolism risk: Consider discontinuation of estrogen-containing medications 30 days prior to bariatric surgery to reduce risk of venous thromboembolism; however, practice may vary based upon institutional protocols (Mechanick 2013).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, hypertension, low HDL, high LDL, high triglycerides, older age, diabetes, women who smoke); use of combination hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in women at high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases.</p><p>• Depression: Use with caution in patients with a history of depression; discontinue if serious depression recurs.</p><p>• Diabetes: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in women with diabetes or prediabetes. In general, use of combination oral contraceptives has limited effects on daily insulin needs and no long-term effects on diabetes control in women with nonvascular disease. However, use in women with concomitant nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, other vascular disease, or diabetes &gt;20 years' duration should be evaluated for contraceptive use based on the severity of the condition (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in women with diabetes mellitus and vascular disease.</p><p>• Endometrial or ovarian cancer: The risk of endometrial or ovarian cancer is decreased in women using combination oral contraceptives; it is not known if use of the contraceptive patch also decreases this risk (Curtis 2016b; Walker 2015). Women awaiting treatment for endometrial or ovarian cancer may use combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Gallbladder disease: Combination hormonal contraceptives may cause a small increased risk of gallbladder disease or may worsen existing gallbladder disease (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas: Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is associated with hepatic adenomas (rare); rupture may cause fatal intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Long term use may be associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (rare). Use is contraindicated with preexisting hepatic tumors.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Combination hormonal contraceptives may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment. Discontinue if jaundice develops during therapy or if liver function becomes abnormal. Use is contraindicated in women with hepatic disease. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered in women with mild (compensated) cirrhosis but should not be used in women with severe (decompensated) cirrhosis (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hepatitis: Initiation of combination hormonal contraceptives is not recommended in women with acute viral hepatitis or during a flare. Continuation of use in women with chronic hepatitis has not been shown to increase the rate or severity of cirrhotic fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Continuation of use in women who are carriers has not been shown to trigger liver failure or severe hepatic dysfunction (Curtis 2016b). Use of norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated with some hepatitis C drug combinations.</p><p>• Hereditary angioedema: Estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms in women with hereditary angioedema (Geng 2013; Zuraw 2013).</p><p>• Hypertension: The risk of hypertension may be increased with age, dose, and duration of use. Combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used in women with hypertension and vascular disease, or persistent BP values ≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥100 mm Hg diastolic. The risks of use may not outweigh the benefits of treatment in women with less severe hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg systolic or 90 to 99 mm Hg diastolic) or those with hypertension that is adequately controlled (Curtis 2016a). Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, older age, smoking, diabetes) should be considered when prescribing contraceptives (Curtis 2016b). The manufacturer contraindicates use in women with uncontrolled hypertension and recommends monitoring women with well-controlled hypertension; discontinue therapy if BP rises significantly.</p><p>• Migraine: Evaluate new, recurrent, severe or persistent headaches. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered in women who have migraines without aura (including menstrual migraines) (Curtis 2016b). Use in women with headaches with focal neurological symptoms, or migraine headaches with or without aura if &gt;35 years of age is contraindicated.</p><p>• Solid organ transplant: Although data are limited, serious medical complications have been reported in women with complicated organ transplants (eg, graft failure, rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy); use of combination hormonal contraceptives is not recommended in women with complicated organ transplants (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Women with SLE are at an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and VTE. Combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used in women with SLE who have positive (or unknown) antiphospholipid antibodies, due to an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (Curtis 2016b).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Thyroid replacement therapy: Estrogens may increase thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone while receiving estrogens.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Obese: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The risk of VTE may be greater with norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol in women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> compared to women with a lower BMI.</b> In addition, the patch may be less effective in patients weighing ≥90 kg (198 lb).</p><p>• Pediatric: Not for use prior to menarche.</p><p>• Postmenopausal women: Use is not indicated in postmenopausal women.</p><p>• Smokers:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination oral contraceptives, including norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol, are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.</b></p><p>• Surgical patients: Whenever possible, should be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to and for 2 weeks following elective surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Consider initiating with a monthly bleeding monophasic formulation containing ethinyl estradiol 30 to 35 mcg plus a progestin and adjusting based on adverse events and patient preference (Ott 2014).</p><p>• HIV infection protection: Combination hormonal contraceptives do not protect against HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases (Curtis 2016a; Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Assessment of pregnancy status (prior to therapy); blood pressure (prior to therapy and yearly); weight (optional; BMI at baseline may be helpful to monitor changes during therapy); assess potential health status changes at routine visits (Curtis 2016a).</p><p>If all patches have been applied on schedule and 1 menstrual period is missed, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered. However, if no withdrawal bleeding occurs for 2 consecutive cycles (2 consecutive menstrual periods are missed), pregnancy status should be assessed. If patch has not been applied as directed, and 1 menstrual period is missed, pregnancy status should be assessed prior to continuing treatment.</p><p>Monitor patient for vision changes; blood pressure; signs and symptoms of thromboembolic disorders; signs or symptoms of depression; glycemic control in patients with diabetes; lipid profiles in patients being treated for hyperlipidemias. Adequate diagnostic measures should be performed to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>The manufacturer states that combination hormonal contraceptives should not be started until ≥4 weeks after delivery in women who choose not to breastfeed, or ≥4 weeks after a second trimester abortion or miscarriage.</p><p>Due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) postpartum, combination hormonal contraceptives should not be started in any woman &lt;21 days following delivery. The risk decreases to baseline by postpartum day 42. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives in women between 21 and 42 days after delivery should take into consideration the individual woman's risk factors for VTE (eg, age ≥35 years, previous VTE, thrombophilia, immobility, preeclampsia, transfusion at delivery, cesarean delivery, peripartum cardiomyopathy, BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, postpartum hemorrhage, smoking) (Curtis 2016b).</p><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
