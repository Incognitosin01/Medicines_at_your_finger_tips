This medicine is not effective against all strains of malaria, or against malaria in areas where the infection has been resistant to a similar drug called hydroxythis medicine.</p><p>Aralen Phosphate is also used to treat amebiasis (infection caused by amoebae).</p><p>Aralen Phosphate may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Aralen Phosphate can cause dangerous effects on your heart,</b> especially if you also use certain other medicines. <b>Seek emergency medical attention if you have fast or pounding heartbeats and sudden dizziness (like you might pass out).</b></p><p>Taking Aralen Phosphate long-term or at high doses may cause irreversible damage to the retina of your eye that could progress to permanent vision problems. You may not be able to use  Aralen Phosphate if you have a history of vision changes or damage to your retina.</p><p><b>Stop taking Aralen Phosphate and call your doctor at once if you have</b> blurred vision, trouble focusing, distorted vision, blind spots, trouble reading, hazy or cloudy vision, increased sensitivity to light.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to Aralen Phosphate or hydroxythis medicine. You may not be able to use this medicine if you have ever had vision changes or damage to your retina.</p><p>High doses or long-term use of chloroquine may cause irreversible damage to your retina (the membrane layer inside your eye that helps produce vision). This could progress to permanent vision problems. The risk of retinal damage is higher in people with pre-existing eye problems, kidney disease, or people who also take tamoxifen.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

If you are pregnant, ask your doctor about the risks of traveling to areas where malaria is common (such as Africa, South America, and Southern Asia).</p><p>You should not breastfeed while using Aralen Phosphate.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take  Aralen Phosphate?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>To prevent malaria: Aralen Phosphate is usually taken once per week on the same day each week. Start taking the medicine 2 weeks before entering an area where malaria is common. Keep taking the medicine during your stay and for at least 8 weeks after you leave the area.</p><p>To treat malaria: Aralen Phosphate is usually given as one high dose followed by smaller doses during the next 2 days in a row.</p><p>To treat amebiasis: Aralen Phosphate is given in a high starting dose for 2 days followed by a smaller dose for 2 to 3 weeks. You may be given other medications to help prevent further infection.</p><p>Aralen Phosphate doses are based on weight in children. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>Use  Aralen Phosphate for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve.</p><p>Call your doctor as soon as possible if you have been exposed to malaria, or if you have fever or other symptoms of illness during or after a stay in an area where malaria is common.</p><p>Use protective clothing, insect repellents, and mosquito netting around your bed to further prevent mosquito bites that could cause malaria.</p><p>No medication is 100% effective in treating or preventing all types of malaria. Talk with your doctor if you have fever, vomiting, or diarrhea during your treatment.</p><p>While using Aralen Phosphate, you may need frequent medical tests and vision exams.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An overdose of  Aralen Phosphate can be fatal, and must be treated quickly.</b></p><p>Overdose symptoms may include drowsiness, vision changes, seizure, slow heart rate, weak pulse, pounding heartbeats, sudden dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, or slow breathing (breathing may stop).</p><p>Keep  Aralen Phosphate out of the reach of children.
