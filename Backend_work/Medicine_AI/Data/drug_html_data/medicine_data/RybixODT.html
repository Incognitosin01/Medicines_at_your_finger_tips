<html><head></head><body><h1>Rybix ODT (Oral)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> tramadol (TRAM-a-dol) (Oral route)</p><p>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse:TraMADol hydrochloride exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing traMADol hydrochloride, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions .Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to: complete a REMS-compliant education program, counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacists, and consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety .Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression:Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of traMADol hydrochloride. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of traMADol hydrochloride or following a dose increase . Instruct patients to swallow traMADol hydrochloride extended release formulations intact, and not to cut, break, chew, crush, or dissolve the tablets to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose of traMADol .Accidental Ingestion:Accidental ingestion of even one dose of traMADol hydrochloride, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of traMADol .Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of TraMADol and Other Risk Factors for Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Children:Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received traMADol. Most of the reported cases occurred following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of traMADol due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism. TraMADol hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Avoid the use of traMADol hydrochloride tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of traMADol .Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome:Prolonged use of traMADol hydrochloride during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available .Interactions with Drug Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes:The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with traMADol are complex. Use of CYP3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with traMADol hydrochloride requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, traMADol, and the active metabolite, M1 .Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants:Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of traMADol hydrochloride and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

The <i>extended-release capsules</i> or <i>tablets</i> are used for chronic ongoing pain.</p><p>Tramadol belongs to the group of medicines called opioid analgesics. It acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.</p><p>When tramadol is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.</p><p>This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Rybix ODT</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p><i>Qdolo</i> should not be used in children younger than 12 years of age and to relieve pain after surgery (eg, surgery to remove adenoid or tonsil) in children.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Rybix™ ODT</i> and <i>Ryzolt™</i> in children younger than 16 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p><i>Conzip® extended-release capsules</i> and <i>Ultram® tablets</i> should not be used in children younger than 12 years of age. <i>It should not be used to relieve pain after surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids in any children. Severe breathing problems and deaths have been reported in some children who received tramadol after tonsil or adenoid surgery</i>.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Ultram® ER extended-release tablets</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of tramadol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects (eg, constipation, lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting, stomach upset, weakness) and age-related liver, kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving tramadol.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using this medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Do not use this medicine if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within the past 14 days.</p><p>You should not take other medicines that also contain tramadol. This includes Conzip®, Qdolo, Rybix™, Ryzolt™, Ultram®, Ultram® ER, or Ultracet®. <i>Using these medicines together may increase your chance for more serious side effects</i>.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor before using this medicine with alcohol or other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS)</i>. The use of alcohol or other medicines that affect the CNS with tramadol may worsen the side effects of this medicine, such as dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.</p><p>This medicine may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using this medicine.</p><p>Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Check with your doctor right away if your baby has an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, weight loss, vomiting, or fails to gain weight. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.</p><p>Tramadol is highly metabolized in the body. Some people change tramadol to a stronger product (<i>O-desmethyltramadol</i>) more quickly than others. These individuals are called "ultra-rapid metabolizers of tramadol". <i>Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing</i>. These symptoms may indicate that you are an "ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol." As a result, there is too much <i>O-desmethyltramadol</i> in the body and more side effects of <i>O-desmethyltramadol</i> than usual. Children may be especially sensitive to this effect (eg, serious breathing problems, death). Do not give this medicine to:</p><ul>
<li>Children younger than 12 years of age.</li>
<li>Children younger than 18 years of age who have had surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids.</li>
<li>Children 12 to 18 years of age who have a high risk for breathing problems (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung disease).</li>
</ul><p>If a nursing mother is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol, it could lead to an overdose in the nursing baby and cause very serious side effects.</p><p><i>For nursing mothers using this medicine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking tramadol or about how this medicine may affect your baby.</li>
<li>Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby.</li>
<li>Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep more than 4 hours at a time.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor, hospital emergency room, or local emergency services (eg, "call 9-1-1") immediately if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.</li>
</ul><p>Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.</p><p>This medicine may cause some people to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors. It may also cause some people to have suicidal thoughts and tendencies or to become more depressed. Make sure your doctor knows if you have trouble sleeping, get upset easily, have a big increase in energy, or start to act reckless. Also tell your doctor if you have any sudden or strong feelings, such as feeling nervous, angry, restless, violent, or scared. Let your doctor know if you or anyone in your family has bipolar disorder (manic-depressive disorder) or has tried to commit suicide.</p><p>This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.</p><p>This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you</i>.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. Also, lying down for a while may relieve dizziness or lightheadedness. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor right away.</p><p>Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, tell the doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking this medicine. Serious side effects can occur if your doctor or dentist gives you certain medicines without knowing that you have been taking tramadol.</p><p>If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of tramadol, get emergency help at once. <i>Signs of an overdose include</i>: seizures, difficult or trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or trouble breathing.</p><p><i>Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping.</p><p>Using too much of this medicine may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Rybix ODT side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
