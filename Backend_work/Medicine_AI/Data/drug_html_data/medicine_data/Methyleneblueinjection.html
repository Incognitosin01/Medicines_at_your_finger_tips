Hemoglobin is a substance in blood that carries oxygen and distributes it to your tissues and organs. However, methemoglobin is not a type of hemoglobin that is useful in carrying oxygen.</p><p>Methemoglobin normally exists in small amounts in the blood. However, when methemoglobin levels increase, the blood is less efficient in circulating oxygen. The resulting lack of oxygen throughout the body can cause symptoms such as pale or blue-colored skin.</p><p>Methemoglobinemia is a condition in which methemoglobin is present in high levels in the blood. Methemoglobinemia can occur when a person is exposed to certain drugs or chemicals such as nitrites.</p><p>Methylene blue injection is used to treat methemoglobinemia.  methylene blue works by converting methemoglobin to a more efficient type of hemoglobin to better carry oxygen throughout the body.</p><p>Methylene blue may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not be treated with methylene blue if you have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.</p><p>Many drugs can interact with methylene blue.
