In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.15)]</span>.</p><p>Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.</p><h3>Treatment of Moderate to Severe Dyspareunia, a Symptom of Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy, Due to Menopause</h3><p class="First">Imvexxy should be administered intravaginally; insert with the smaller end up for a depth of about two inches into the vaginal canal. Insert 1 daily at approximately the same time for 2 weeks, followed by 1 insert twice weekly, every three to four days (for example, Monday and Thursday). Generally, women should be started at the 4 mcg dosage strength. Dosage adjustment should be guided by the clinical response.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Imvexxy are small, light pink, tear shaped, vaginal inserts for manual placement into the vagina. Imvexxy inserts contain 4 mcg or 10 mcg of estradiol. Each insert is imprinted in white ink on one side with “04” or “10” corresponding to the insert's dosage strength.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Imvexxy is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding</li>
<li>Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer</li>
<li>Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia</li>
<li>Active DVT, PE, or history of these conditions</li>
<li>Active arterial thromboembolic disease (for example, stroke and myocardial infarction (MI)), or a history of these conditions</li>
<li>Known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema with Imvexxy</li>
<li>Known liver impairment or disease</li>
<li>Known protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency, or other known thrombophilic disorders</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risks from Systemic Absorption</h3><p class="First">Imvexxy is intended only for vaginal administration. Systemic absorption may occur with the use of Imvexxy <span class="Italics">[see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].</span> The warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions associated with the use of systemic estrogen-alone therapy should be taken into account.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Disorders</h3><p class="First">An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke, and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Stroke</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.

During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of the original HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Venous Thromboembolism</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years<span class="Sup">3</span> <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted<span class="Sup">4</span> <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><h3>Malignant Neoplasms</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Endometrial Cancer</span></p><p>An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with an increased risk of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.</p><p>Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.</p><p>There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Breast Cancer</span></p><p>The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80]<span class="Sup">5</span> <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><p>The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups<span class="Sup">6</span> <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><p>Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping). Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.</p><p>The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin therapy has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.</p><p>All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Ovarian Cancer</span></p><p>The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77 to 3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.<span class="Sup">7</span></p><p>A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95 percent CI, 1.27 to 1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.</p><h3>Probable Dementia</h3><p class="First">In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.</p><p>After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years<span class="Sup">8</span> <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>.</p><p>In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years<span class="Sup">8</span> <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>.</p><p>When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women<span class="Sup">8</span> <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), and Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.</p><h3>Hypercalcemia</h3><p class="First">Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.</p><h3>Visual Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.</p><h3>Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy</h3><p class="First">Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.</p><p>There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.</p><h3>Elevated Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.</p><h3>Hypertriglyceridemia</h3><p class="First">In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice</h3><p class="First">Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.</p><h3>Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First">Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.</p><h3>Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogen-alone is prescribed.</p><h3>Hypocalcemia</h3><p class="First">Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Endometriosis</h3><p class="First">Cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.</p><h3>Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Other Conditions</h3><p class="First">Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause.</p><h3>Drug Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.</p><p>Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone.</p><p>Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).</p><p>Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, increased triglyceride levels.</p><p>Impaired glucose tolerance.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Cardiovascular Disorders <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></li>
<li>Malignant Neoplasms <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of Imvexxy 4 mcg and 10 mcg was assessed in a single, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial (N=382). The duration of treatment in this trial was 12 weeks (dosing occurred every day for 14 days and then twice weekly thereafter for maintenance).</p><p>Adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥3 percent in any Imvexxy group and numerically greater than those reported in the placebo group are listed in Table 1.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Imvexxy 4 and 10 mcg. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Genitourinary system</span></p><p>Vaginal discharge</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with Imvexxy.</p><h3>Metabolic Interactions</h3><p class="First">In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4, such as St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin, may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Imvexxy is not indicated for use in pregnancy. There are no data with the use of Imvexxy in pregnant women; however, epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives (estrogen and progestins) before conception or during early pregnancy.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Imvexxy is not indicated for use in females of reproductive potential.

Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of Imvexxy therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care.</p><h2>Imvexxy Description</h2><p class="First">Imvexxy (estradiol vaginal inserts) are small, light pink, tear-shaped, vaginal inserts for manual placement into the vagina. Inserts contain 4 mcg or 10 mcg of estradiol, an estrogen. Each insert is imprinted in white ink on one side with “04” or “10” corresponding to the insert's dosage strength. Imvexxy vaginal inserts are used intravaginally. When the insert comes in contact with the vaginal mucosa, estradiol is released into the vagina.</p><p>Estradiol is chemically described as estra-1,3,5 (10)-triene-3,17β-diol. The chemical formula is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> with a molecular weight of 272.38.</p><p>The structural formula is:</p><p>Imvexxy (estradiol vaginal inserts) contain the following inactive ingredients: ammonium hydroxide, ethanol, ethyl acetate, ethylene glycol palmitostearate, FD&amp;C Red #40, gelatin, glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, lecithin, medium chain triglycerides, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol stearates, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, propylene glycol, purified water, sorbitol-sorbitan solution, and titanium dioxide. FDA approved acceptance criteria for assay, organic impurities, and dissolution tolerances differ from the USP test.</p><h2>Imvexxy - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.</p><p>The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.</p><p>Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Currently there are no pharmacodynamics data known for Imvexxy.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Estrogen drug products are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and the gastrointestinal tract. The vaginal delivery of estrogens circumvents first-pass metabolism.</p><p>In a multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled study of 574 postmenopausal women randomized to placebo, or 4 and 10 mcg of Imvexxy, a subset of 54 women participated in a pharmacokinetics substudy. Women received 1 vaginal insert daily for the first 2 weeks, followed by 1 insert twice weekly for the following 10 weeks.</p><p>Mean (±SD) serum estradiol and estrone following 14 days of once daily administration of Imvexxy are shown in Figure 1. Administration of the 4 mcg and 10 mcg Imvexxy vaginal inserts and placebo once daily for 14 days resulted in a mean estradiol C<span class="Sub">avg (0-24)</span> of 3.6, 4.6, and 4.3 pg/mL, respectively, Table 2.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Mean (±SD) Serum Concentration of Estradiol and Estrone on Day 14 Following Daily Administration of Imvexxy 4 mcg, Imvexxy 10 mcg, and Placebo</span></p><p>At Day 84, estradiol concentrations compared to Baseline concentrations were: 4.3 vs 3.9 pg/mL for 4 mcg; 4.8 vs 5.0 pg/mL for 10 mcg; and 4.4 vs 4.5 pg/mL for placebo.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations</span></p><p>No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in specific populations, including women with renal or hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Effects on Moderate to Severe Dyspareunia</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness and safety of Imvexxy on moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause were examined in one placebo-controlled clinical trial.</p><p>This 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial enrolled 574 generally healthy postmenopausal women between 40 to 75 years of age (mean 59 years of age) who at baseline assessment had ≤5 percent superficial cells on a vaginal smear, a vaginal pH &gt;5.0, and also identified, at baseline, moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom to her. Greater than 90% of women also reported moderate to severe vaginal dryness at baseline. Treatment groups included 4 mcg Imvexxy (n=191), 10 mcg Imvexxy (n=191), and placebo (n=192). All women were assessed for improvement in the mean change from Baseline to Week 12 for the co-primary efficacy variables of: most bothersome moderate to severe symptom of dyspareunia, percentage of vaginal superficial and percentage of vaginal parabasal cells on a vaginal smear, and vaginal pH.</p><p>Imvexxy 4 mcg and 10 mcg inserts were statistically superior to placebo in reducing the severity of moderate to severe dyspareunia at Week 12 (see Table 3). A statistically significant increase in the percentage of superficial cells and a corresponding statistically significant decrease in the percentage of parabasal cells on a vaginal smear was also demonstrated for Imvexxy 4 and 10 mcg inserts (p&lt;0.0001). The mean reduction in vaginal pH between Baseline and Week 12 was also statistically significant for Imvexxy 4 and 10 mcg inserts (p&lt;0.0001).</p><p class="First Footnote">The modified intent-to-treat population (MITT) included only women in the ITT population who at baseline met the inclusion criteria of ≤5 percent superficial cells on a vaginal smear, a vaginal pH &gt;5.0, and who identified moderate or severe dyspareunia as her most bothersome vaginal symptom.</p><p class="First Footnote">Definitions: SD – standard deviation; SE – standard error; LS – least square</p><h3>Women's Health Initiative Studies</h3><p class="First">The WHI enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE (0.625 mg)-alone or in combination with MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases.
