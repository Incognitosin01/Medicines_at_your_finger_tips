</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Colesevelam Tablets</h2><h3>Primary Hyperlipidemia</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in adults with primary hyperlipidemia.<br/>
Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets are indicated to reduce LDL-C levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who are unable to reach LDL-C target levels despite an adequate trial of dietary therapy and lifestyle modification.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">• Colesevelam hydrochloride should not be used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.<br/>
• The effect of colesevelam hydrochloride on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.<br/>
• Colesevelam hydrochloride has not been studied in type 2 diabetes in combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor.<br/>
• Colesevelam hydrochloride has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I, III, IV, and V dyslipidemias.<br/>
• Colesevelam hydrochloride has not been studied in children younger than 10 years of age or in pre­menarchal girls.</p><h2>Colesevelam Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Testing Prior to Initiation of Colesevelam Hydrochloride Tablets</h3><p class="First">Obtain lipid parameters, including triglyceride (TG) levels, before starting colesevelam hydrochloride tablets. Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with TG levels &gt;500 mg/dL <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span><span class="following_xmChange">.</span></p><h3>Recommended Dosage in Primary Hyperlipidemia</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets for adults and children 10 to 17 years old with primary hyperlipidemia is 3.75 grams daily. Colesevelam hydrochloride should be taken as follows:<br/>
<span class="Bold">Tablets</span><br/>
Take 6 tablets once daily or 3 tablets twice daily. Due to tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension is recommended for use in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Important Dosing Information for Primary Hyperlipidemia</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets can be dosed at the same time as a statin, or colesevelam hydrochloride tablets and the statin can be dosed apart. Monitor lipid levels within 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets.</p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tablets</span></p><p>Take colesevelam hydrochloride tablets with a meal and liquid. For patients with difficulty swallowing tablets, use colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tablets: 625 mg tablets are off-white to light yellow, capsule shaped coated tablets imprinted with “083” in black ink on one side and plain on other side and free from physical defects.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with:<br/>
• Serum TG concentrations &gt;500 mg/dL <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span><br/>
• History of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span><br/>
• A history of bowel obstruction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypertriglyceridemia and Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum TG concentrations. Hypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis.<br/>
Colesevelam hydrochloride had effects on serum TG (median increase 5% compared to placebo) in trials of patients with primary hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Obtain lipid parameters, including TG levels, before starting colesevelam hydrochloride and periodically thereafter. Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with TG levels &gt;500 mg/dL or patients with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Patients with TG levels greater than 300 mg/dL could have greater increases in serum TG levels with colesevelam hydrochloride and may require additional TG monitoring. Instruct patients to discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride and seek prompt medical attention if the symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur (e.g., severe abdominal pain with or without nausea and vomiting). Discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride if TG levels exceed 500 mg/dL <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span><span class="following_xmChange">.</span></p><h3>Gastrointestinal Obstruction</h3><p class="First">Postmarketing cases of bowel obstruction have occurred with colesevelam hydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Because of its constipating effects, colesevelam hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with gastroparesis, other gastrointestinal motility disorders, and in those who have had major gastrointestinal tract surgery and who may be at risk for bowel obstruction. Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with a history of bowel obstruction <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride and seek medical attention if severe abdominal pain or severe constipation occurs.</p><p>Because of the tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride tablets can cause dysphagia or esophageal obstruction. For patients with difficulty swallowing tablets, use colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspention.</p><h3>Vitamin K or Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients with a susceptibility to deficiencies of vitamin K (e.g., patients on warfarin, patients with malabsorption syndromes) or other fat-soluble vitamins may be at increased risk when taking colesevelam hydrochloride.<br/>
Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Administer drugs with a known interaction at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7)].<br/>
Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs that have not been tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider administering at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular disease risk reduction with colesevelam hydrochloride.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:<br/>
• Hypertriglyceridemia and Pancreatitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span><br/>
• Gastrointestinal Obstruction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span><br/>
• Vitamin K or Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Primary Hyperlipidemia</span><br/>
In 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 807 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (age range 18-86 years, 50% women, 90% Caucasians, 7% Blacks, 2% Hispanics, 1% Asians) and elevated LDL-C were treated with colesevelam hydrochloride 1.5 g/day to 4.5 g/day from 4 to 24 weeks (total exposure 199 patient-years).</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 10 to 17 Years of Age</span><br/>
In an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, boys and post-menarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with HeFH (n=194), were treated with colesevelam hydrochloride tablets (1.9-3.8 g, daily) or placebo tablets.</p><p> The reported adverse reactions during the additional 18-week open-label treatment period with colesevelam hydrochloride 3.8 g per day were similar to those during the double-blind period and included headache (7.6%), nasopharyngitis (5.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.9%), influenza (3.8%), and nausea (3.8%).</p><h3>Post-marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of colesevelam hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions Resulting from Drug Interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>: Increased seizure activity or decreased phenytoin levels in patients receiving phenytoin, reduced International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin therapy, and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal</span>: Bowel obstruction (in patients with a history of bowel obstruction or resection), dysphagia or esophageal obstruction (occasionally requiring medical intervention), fecal impaction, pancreatitis, abdominal distension, exacerbation of hemorrhoids, and increased transaminases</p><p><span class="Italics">Laboratory Abnormalities</span>: Hypertriglyceridemia</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Colesevelam hydrochloride Drug Interactions that Decrease the Exposure of the Concomitant Medication</h3><p class="First">Table 4 includes a list of drugs that decrease exposure of the concomitant medication when administered concomitantly with colesevelam hydrochloride and instructions for preventing or managing them.</p><h3>Colesevelam Hydrochloride Drug Interactions that Increase the Exposure of the Concomitant Medication</h3><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed systemically following oral administration, and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Limited available data on the use of colesevelam hydrochloride are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of either maternal or fetal toxicity was found in rats or rabbits exposed to colesevelam hydrochloride during the period of fetal organogenesis at 8 and 5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3.75 g/day, based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). No adverse effects on offspring survival and development were observed in rats administered 5 times the MRHD <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Colesevelam hydrochloride may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>. There are no data available on the effect of colesevelam hydrochloride on the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in pregnant women. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking colesevelam hydrochloride, the patient should be advised of the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Human Data</span><br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of colesevelam hydrochloride use in pregnant women. In the postmarketing setting there have been infrequent reports of pregnancy with use of colesevelam hydrochloride and a causal association with congenital anomalies has not been established.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
In pregnant rats given dietary doses of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 g/kg/day colesevelam hydrochloride from gestation days 7 through 17, no teratogenic effects were observed. Exposures at 3.0 g/kg/day were 8 times the human exposure at 3.75 g/day MRHD, based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><p>In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 g/kg/day colesevelam hydrochloride from gestation days 6 through 18, no teratogenic effects were observed. Exposures at 1.0 g/kg/day were 5 times the human exposure at 3.75 g/day MRHD, based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><p>In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 g/kg/day colesevelam hydrochloride from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 (weaning), no adverse effects on survival and development were observed. Exposures at 1.0 g/kg/day were 5 times the human exposure at 3.75 g/day MRHD, based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to colesevelam hydrochloride.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception</span><br/>
Use of colesevelam hydrochloride may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Advise patients to take oral contraceptives at least 4 hours prior to taking colesevelam hydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of colesevelam hydrochloride as monotherapy or in combination with a statin were evaluated in children, 10 to 17 years of age, with HeFH <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>. The adverse reaction profile was similar to that of patients treated with placebo. In this limited controlled study, there were no significant effects on growth, sexual maturation, fat-soluble vitamin levels or clotting factors in the adolescent boys or girls relative to placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Due to tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension is recommended for use in the pediatric population. Dose adjustments are not required when colesevelam hydrochloride is administered to children 10 to 17 years of age.</p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride has not been studied in children younger than 10 years of age or in premenarchal girls.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary Hyperlipidemia</span><br/>
Of the 1350 patients enrolled in the hyperlipidemia clinical studies, 349 (26%) were ≥65 years old, and 58 (4%) were ≥75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed and the risk of systemic toxicity is low. Excessive doses of colesevelam hydrochloride may cause more severe local gastrointestinal effects (e.g., constipation).</p><h2>Colesevelam Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride is a non-absorbed, polymeric, lipid-lowering agent for oral administration. Colesevelam hydrochloride is a high-capacity bile acid-binding molecule.</p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride is poly(allylamine hydrochloride) cross-linked with epichlorohydrin and alkylated with 1-bromodecane and (6-bromohexyl)-trimethylammonium bromide. The chemical name (IUPAC) of colesevelam hydrochloride is allylamine polymer with 1-chloro-2,3-epoxypropane, [6-(allylamino)-hexyl]trimethylammonium chloride and N-allyldecylamine, hydrochloride. The chemical structure of colesevelam hydrochloride is represented by the following formula:</p><p></p><p>wherein (a) represents allyl amine monomer units that have not been alkylated by either of the 1-bromodecane or (6-bromohexyl)-trimethylammonium bromide alkylating agents or cross-linked by epichlorohydrin; (b) represents allyl amine units that have undergone cross-linking with epichlorohydrin; (c) represents allyl amine units that have been alkylated with a decyl group; (d) represents allyl amine units that have been alkylated with a (6-trimethylammonium) hexyl group, and m represents a number ≥ 100 to indicate an extended polymer network. A small amount of the amines are dialkylated and are not depicted in the formula above. No regular order of the groups is implied by the structure; cross-linking and alkylation are expected to occur randomly along the polymer chains. A large amount of the amines are protonated. The polymer is depicted in the hydrochloride form; a small amount of the halides are bromide. Colesevelam hydrochloride is hydrophilic and insoluble in water.</p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets are off-white to light yellow, capsule shaped coated tablets each containing 625 mg colesevelam hydrochloride. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, hypromellose 2910, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol 6000. The tablets are imprinted using a black ink of opacode black S-1-17823 containing ferrosoferric oxide, propylene glycol and shellac.</p><h2>Colesevelam Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Primary Hyperlipidemia</span>: Colesevelam hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in colesevelam hydrochloride tablets, is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A maximum therapeutic response to the lipid-lowering effects of colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long-term therapy.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
Colesevelam hydrochloride is a hydrophilic, water-insoluble polymer that is not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and is not absorbed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed, and therefore, its distribution is limited to the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><br/>
Colesevelam hydrochloride is not metabolized systemically and does not interfere with systemic drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Excretion</span><br/>
In 16 healthy volunteers, an average of 0.05% of administered radioactivity from a single <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled colesevelam hydrochloride dose was excreted in the urine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span><br/>
Drug interactions between colesevelam and concomitantly administered drugs were screened through i<span class="Italics">n vitro</span> studies and confirmed in <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrated that cephalexin, metformin, and ciprofloxacin had negligible binding to colesevelam hydrochloride. Therefore, an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> pharmacokinetic interaction of colesevelam hydrochloride with these drugs is unlikely. Colesevelam hydrochloride was found to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of aspirin, atenolol, digoxin, enalapril, fenofibrate, lovastatin, metoprolol, phenytoin, pioglitazone, quinidine, rosiglitazone, sitagliptin, valproic acid, and warfarin. The results of additional <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug interactions of colesevelam hydrochloride are presented in Table 6.</p><p>* With verapamil, the dose of colesevelam hydrochloride was 4.5 g.</p><p>† Oral contraceptive containing norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol<br/>
N/A- not available</p><h2>13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span><br/>
A 104-week carcinogenicity study with colesevelam hydrochloride was conducted in CD-1 mice, at oral dietary doses up to 3 g/kg/day. This dose was approximately 50 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4.5 g/day, based on body weight, mg/kg. There were no significant drug-induced tumor findings in male or female mice. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study with colesevelam hydrochloride in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma was seen in male rats at doses &gt;1.2 g/kg/day (approximately 20 times the maximum human dose, based on body weight, mg/kg) (trend test only). A statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell adenoma was seen in female rats at 2.4 g/kg/day (approximately 40 times the maximum human dose, based on body weight, mg/kg).</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span><br/>
Colesevelam hydrochloride and 4 degradants present in the drug substance have been evaluated for mutagenicity in the Ames test and a mammalian chromosomal aberration test. The 4 degradants and an extract of the parent compound did not exhibit genetic toxicity in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial mutagenesis assay in <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> (Ames assay) with or without rat liver metabolic activation. An extract of the parent compound was positive in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration assay in the presence of metabolic activation and negative in the absence of metabolic activation. The results of the CHO cell chromosomal aberration assay with 2 of the 4 degradants, decylamine HCl and aminohexyltrimethyl ammonium chloride HCl, were equivocal in the absence of metabolic activation and negative in the presence of metabolic activation. The other 2 degradants, didecylamine HCl and 6-decylamino-hexyltrimethyl ammonium chloride HCl, were negative in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
Colesevelam hydrochloride did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 3 g/kg/day (approximately 50 times the maximum human dose, based on body weight, mg/kg).</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reproductive Toxicology Studies</span><br/>
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 3 g/kg/day and 1 g/kg/day, respectively (approximately 50 and 17 times the maximum human dose, based on body weight, mg/kg) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to colesevelam hydrochloride.</p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><h3>Primary Hyperlipidemia</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride reduces total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) when administered alone or in combination with a statin in patients with primary hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Approximately 1600 patients were studied in 9 clinical trials with treatment durations ranging from 4 to 50 weeks. With the exception of one open-label, uncontrolled, long-term extension study, all studies were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. A maximum therapeutic response to colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long-term therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Monotherapy</span><br/>
In a study in patients with LDL-C between 130 mg/dL and 220 mg/dL (mean<br/>
158 mg/dL), colesevelam hydrochloride was given for 24 weeks in divided doses with the morning and evening meals.<br/>
As shown in Table 7, the mean LDL-C reductions were 15% and 18% at the 3.8 g and 4.5 g doses. The respective mean TC reductions were 7% and 10%. The mean Apo B reductions were 12% in both treatment groups. Colesevelam hydrochloride at both doses increased HDL-C by 3%. Increases in TG of 9-10% were observed at both colesevelam hydrochloride doses, but the changes were not statistically different from placebo.</p><p> * Median % change from baseline</p><p>p&lt;0.05 for lipid parameters compared to placebo, for Apo B compared to baseline</p><p>In a study in 98 patients with LDL-C between 145 mg/dL and 250 mg/dL (mean 169 mg/dL), colesevelam hydrochloride 3.8 g was given for 6 weeks as a single dose with breakfast, as a single dose with dinner, or as divided doses with breakfast and dinner. The mean LDL-C reductions were 18%, 15%, and 18% for the 3 dosing regimens, respectively. The reductions with these 3 regimens were not statistically different from one another.</p><p><span class="Bold">Combination Therapy</span><br/>
Co-administration of colesevelam hydrochloride and a statin (atorvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin) in 3 clinical studies demonstrated an additive reduction of LDL-C. The mean baseline LDL-C was 184 mg/dL in the atorvastatin study (range 156-236 mg/dL), 171 mg/dL in the lovastatin study (range 115-247 mg/dL), and 188 mg/dL in the simvastatin study (range 148-352 mg/dL). As demonstrated in Table 8, colesevelam hydrochloride doses of 2.3 g to 3.8 g resulted in an additional 8% to 16% reduction in LDL-C above that seen with the statin alone.</p><p>* Median % change from baseline<br/>
† p&lt;0.05 for lipid parameters compared to placebo, for Apo B compared to baseline</p><p>In all 3 studies, the LDL-C reduction achieved with the combination of colesevelam hydrochloride and any given dose of statin therapy was statistically superior to that achieved with colesevelam hydrochloride or that dose of the statin alone. The LDL-C reduction with atorvastatin 80 mg was not statistically significantly different from the combination of colesevelam hydrochloride 3.8 g and atorvastatin 10 mg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Therapy</span><br/>
The safety and efficacy of colesevelam hydrochloride in pediatric patients were evaluated in an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study followed by an open-label phase, in 194 boys and postmenarchal girls 10-17 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with HeFH, taking a stable dose of an FDA-approved statin (with LDL-C &gt;130 mg/dL) or naïve to lipid-lowering therapy (with LDL-C &gt;160 mg/dL). This study had 3 periods: a single-blind, placebo stabilization period; an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled treatment period; and an 18-week, open-label treatment period. Forty-seven (24%) patients were taking statins and 147 (76%) patients were statin-naïve at screening. The mean baseline LDL-C at Day 1 was approximately 199 mg/dL.</p><p>During the double-blind treatment period, patients were assigned randomly to treatment: Colesevelam hydrochloride 3.8 g/day (n=64), colesevelam hydrochloride 1.9 g/day (n=65), or placebo (n=65). In total, 186 patients completed the double-blind treatment period. After 8 weeks of treatment, colesevelam hydrochloride 3.8 g/day significantly decreased plasma levels of LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, and Apo B and significantly increased HDL-C. A moderate, non-statistically significant increase in TG was observed versus placebo (Table 9).</p><p>* For triglycerides, median % change from baseline</p><p>† p≤0.05 for lipid parameters compared to placebo</p><p>Values represent LS mean. Only patients with values at both study baseline and endpoint are included in this table. Study baseline was defined as the last value measured before or on Day 1 prior to the first dose of randomized study medication.<br/>
Results were based on the ITT population with LOCF.</p><p>During the open-label treatment period patients were treated with colesevelam hydrochloride 3.8 g/day. In total, 173 (89%) patients completed 26 weeks of treatment. Results at Week 26 were consistent with those at Week 8.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets, 625 mg, are supplied as off-white to light yellow, capsule shaped coated tablets imprinted with “083” in black ink on one side and plain on other side and free from physical defects.
