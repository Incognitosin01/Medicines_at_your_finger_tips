Leukemia cells lack asparagine synthetase and are unable to synthesize asparagine. Asparaginase reduces the exogenous asparagine source for the leukemic cells, resulting in cytotoxicity specific to leukemic cells.</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>IM: ~16 hours (Asselin 1993; Avramis 2005); IV: ~7.5 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia:</b> Treatment (in combination with other chemotherapy) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in patients with hypersensitivity to <i>E. coli</i>-derived asparaginase</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>History of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis to asparaginase (<i>Erwinia</i>) or any component of the formulation; history of serious pancreatitis, serious thrombosis, or serious hemorrhagic events with prior asparaginase treatment</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in the US labeling): Women who are or may become pregnant</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> If administering IV, consider monitoring nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) levels; if desired levels are not achieved, change to IM administration.</p><p><b>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL):</b> IM, IV:</p><p><i>As a substitute for pegaspargase:</i> 25,000 units/m<sup>2</sup> 3 times weekly (Mon, Wed, Fri) for 6 doses for each planned pegaspargase dose</p><p><i>As a substitute for asparaginase (E. coli):</i> 25,000 units/m<sup>2</sup> for each scheduled asparaginase (<i>E. coli</i>) dose</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> If administering IV, consider monitoring nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) levels; if desired levels are not achieved, change to IM administration.</p><p><b>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL):</b> Children and Adolescents:</p><p><i>As a substitute for pegaspargase:</i> IM, IV: 25,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose 3 times weekly (Mon, Wed, Fri) for 6 doses for each planned pegaspargase dose</p><p><i>As a substitute for asparaginase (E. coli):</i> IM, IV: 25,000 units/m<sup>2</sup>/dose for each scheduled asparaginase (<i>E. coli</i>) dose</p><p><b>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) induction: </b><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Infants, Children, and Adolescents &lt;14 years: IM: 6,000 units/m<sup>2</sup> 3 times weekly for 9 doses beginning day 4 of week 1 (in combination with allopurinol, vincristine, prednisone, methotrexate, and daunorubicin)</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for toxicity:</b></p><p>Manufacturer's labeling: Children and Adolescents:</p><p><i>Hemorrhagic or thrombotic event:</i> Discontinue treatment; may resume treatment upon symptom resolution.</p><p><i>Pancreatitis:</i></p><p>Mild pancreatitis: Withhold treatment until signs and symptoms subside and amylase returns to normal; may resume after resolution.</p><p>Severe or hemorrhagic pancreatitis (abdominal pain &gt;72 hours and amylase ≥2 x ULN): Discontinue treatment; further use is contraindicated.</p><p><i>Serious hypersensitivity:</i> Discontinue treatment.</p><p>The following adjustments have also been recommended for asparaginase products (Stock 2011): Older Adolescents:</p><p><i>Hyperammonemia-related fatigue:</i> Continue therapy for grade 2 toxicity.

Gently direct the NS down the wall of the vial (do not inject forcefully into or onto the powder). Dissolve by gently swirling or mixing; do not shake or invert the vial. Resulting reconstituted solution should be clear and colorless and free of visible particles or protein aggregates. Within 15 minutes of reconstitution, withdraw appropriate volume for dose into a polypropylene syringe. If administering intravenously, slowly inject the appropriate volume of reconstituted solution into a NS 100 mL infusion bag; do not shake or squeeze the bag. Administer within 4 hours of reconstitution.</p><p>Additional special preparation instructions may be required for select Asparaginase (<i>Erwinia</i>) batches. Asparaginase (<i>Erwinia</i>) vials from certain US batches should <b>only</b> be administered intramuscularly.</p><p>Refer to the following for batch-specific information:</p><p>Erwinaze [US product]: http://erwinazesupply.com/product-updates/</p><p>Erwinase [Canadian product]: http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2017/63916a-eng.php</p><h2>Administration</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Vials from certain batches should <b>only</b> be administered intramuscularly or require the use of a 0.2 micron filter if administered intravenously. Refer to the following for batch-specific information: http://erwinazesupply.com/product-updates/.</p><p>IM: The volume of each single injection site should be limited to 2 mL; use multiple injections for volumes &gt;2 mL.</p><p>IV: Infuse over 1 to 2 hours; do not infuse other medications through the same IV line.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Protect from light. Within 15 minutes of reconstitution, withdraw appropriate volume for dose into a polypropylene syringe. Do not freeze or refrigerate reconstituted solution; discard if not administered within 4 hours.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>DexAMETHasone (Systemic): Asparaginase (Erwinia) may increase the serum concentration of DexAMETHasone (Systemic). This is thought to be due to an asparaginase-related decrease in hepatic proteins responsible for dexamethasone metabolism. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Hyperglycemia</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting</p><p>Hepatic: Increased serum transaminases</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reaction</p><p>Immunologic: Antibody development</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Thrombosis</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Decreased glucose tolerance</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distress, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pancreatitis, stomatitis</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Hemorrhage</p><p>Hepatic: Hyperbilirubinemia</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Local hypersensitivity reaction</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever</p><p>&lt;1%: Anaphylaxis, hyperammonemia</p><p>Frequency not defined: Cardiovascular: Cerebrovascular accident</p><p>Postmarketing: Pulmonary embolism, sagittal sinus thrombosis</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• GI toxicity: Antiemetics may be recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting; in pediatrics, IV doses ≥20,000 units/m<sup>2</sup> are associated with a high emetic potential (Paw Cho Sing 2019).</p><p>• Glucose intolerance: In clinical trials, 5% of patients experienced glucose intolerance; may be irreversible. Monitor glucose levels (baseline and periodic) during treatment. May require insulin administration.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (grade 3 and 4), including anaphylaxis, have occurred in 5% of patients in clinical trials. Immediate treatment for hypersensitivity reactions should be available during treatment. Discontinue for serious hypersensitivity reactions (and administer appropriate treatment).</p><p>• Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis has been reported in 4% of patients in clinical trials. Promptly evaluate with symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis. For mild pancreatitis, withhold treatment until signs and symptoms subside and amylase levels return to normal; may resume after resolution. Discontinue for severe or hemorrhagic pancreatitis characterized by abdominal pain &gt;72 hours and amylase ≥2 x ULN. Further use is contraindicated if severe pancreatitis is diagnosed.</p><p>• Thrombosis and hemorrhage: Serious thrombotic events, including sagittal sinus thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, have been reported with asparaginase formulations. Discontinue for thrombotic event, may resume treatment after resolution. Decreases in fibrinogen, protein C activity, protein S activity, and antithrombin III have been noted following a 2-week treatment course administered intramuscularly. Discontinue for hemorrhagic event; may resume treatment after resolution (contraindicated with history of serious thrombosis or hemorrhagic event with prior asparaginase treatment).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Medication error prevention: Do not interchange <i>Erwinia</i> asparaginase for <i>E. coli</i> asparaginase, calaspargase pegol, or pegaspargase; ensure the proper formulation, route of administration, and dose prior to administration.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential, amylase, lipase, triglycerides, liver enzymes, blood glucose (baseline and periodically during treatment), coagulation parameters; for IV administration, consider monitoring nadir serum asparaginase activity levels. Monitor for symptoms of hypersensitivity, symptoms of pancreatitis, thrombosis, or hemorrhage. Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during therapy and for 3 months after the last dose of asparaginase (<i>Erwinia</i>); use of oral contraceptives is not recommended.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to asparaginase (<i>Erwinia</i>) may cause fetal harm.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat a type of leukemia.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
