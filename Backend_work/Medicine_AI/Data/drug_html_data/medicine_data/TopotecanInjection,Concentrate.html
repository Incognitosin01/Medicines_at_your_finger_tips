</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: 4 mg/4 mL (1 mg/mL topotecan free base) clear, light yellow to greenish solution in a single-dose vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Topotecan Injection is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to topotecan. Reactions have included anaphylactoid reactions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">Topotecan can cause severe myelosuppression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Single Agent</span></p><p>Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 78% of 879 patients, with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Cycle 1 (58% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia associated with infection occurred in 13% and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5%. Sepsis occurred in 4% of patients and was fatal in 1%. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 27%, with a median duration of 5 days. Grade 3 or 4 anemia occurred in 37% of patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Combination with Cisplatin</span><br/></p><p>Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 48% and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 7% of 147 patients. Grade 3 or 4 anemia occurred in 40% of patients.<br/></p><p>Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain.<br/></p><p>Administer the first cycle of Topotecan Injection only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3 and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Monitor blood counts frequently during treatment. Withhold and reduce dose of Topotecan Injection based on neutrophil counts, platelet counts and hemoglobin levels <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><h3>Interstitial Lung Disease</h3><p class="First">Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, can occur with topotecan. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs or colony stimulating factors. Monitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. Permanently discontinue Topotecan Injection if ILD is confirmed.</p><h3>Extravasation and Tissue Injury</h3><p class="First">Extravasation, including severe cases, can occur with topotecan. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of Topotecan Injection and institute recommended management procedures <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on animal data, Topotecan Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of Topotecan Injection. Advise males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Topotecan Injection and for 3 months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">

The primary complication of overdosage is myelosuppression. Elevated hepatic enzymes, mucositis, gastrointestinal toxicity, and skin toxicity have occurred with overdosages. If an overdose is suspected, monitor the patient closely for myelosuppression and institute supportive-care measures as appropriate.</p><h2>Topotecan Injection, Concentrate Description</h2><p class="First">Topotecan is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin and a topoisomerase inhibitor. The chemical name for topotecan hydrochloride is (<span class="Italics">S</span>)-10-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-4-ethyl-4,9-dihydroxy-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-pyrano[3’,4’:6,7] indolizino [1,2-<span class="Italics">b</span>]quinoline-3,14-(4<span class="Italics">H</span>,12<span class="Italics">H</span>)-dione 1.25 hydrochloride. It has the molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">23</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>•xHCl (x = 1.25) and a molecular weight of 467.02. It is soluble in water and melts with decomposition at 213°C to 218°C.</p><p>Topotecan hydrochloride has the following structural formula:<br/></p><p>Topotecan Injection for intravenous use is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, light yellow to greenish solution in a single-dose vial at a topotecan free base concentration of 4 mg/4 mL (1 mg/mL).</p><p>Each mL contains 1 mg topotecan free base (equivalent to 1.11 mg topotecan hydrochloride), 12 mg of mannitol, USP, and 5 mg of tartaric acid, NF. It may also contain hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH. The solution pH ranges from 2.0 to 2.5.<br/></p><h2>Topotecan Injection, Concentrate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents re-ligation of these single-strand breaks. The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis, when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan, topoisomerase I, and DNA. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following administration of topotecan at doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/m2 (0.1 to 0.3 times the recommended single agent dose) administered as a 30-minute infusion, the area under the curve (AUC) increases proportionally with dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Protein binding of topotecan is approximately 35%.</p><p><span class="Bold">E</span><span class="Bold">limination</span></p><p>The terminal half-life of topotecan is 2 to 3 hours following intravenous administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Topotecan undergoes a reversible pH-dependent hydrolysis of its pharmacologically active lactone moiety. At pH less than or equal to 4, the lactone is exclusively present, whereas the ring-opened hydroxy-acid form predominates at physiologic pH. Topotecan is metabolized to an N-demethylated metabolite in vitro. The mean metabolite: parent AUC ratio is 3% for total topotecan and topotecan lactone following intravenous administration. </p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>The overall recovery of total topotecan and its N-desmethyl metabolite in urine and feces over 9 days averaged 73% ± 2% following an intravenous dose. Mean values (±SD) of 51% (± 3%) as total topotecan and 3% (± 1%) as N-desmethyl topotecan were excreted in the urine. Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 18% (± 4%) while fecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7% (± 0.6%). An O-glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N-desmethyl topotecan has been identified in the urine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan were observed based on age, sex, or hepatic impairment following intravenous administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Compared to patients with CLcr (calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault method using ideal body weight) greater than 60 mL/min, plasma clearance of topotecan lactone decreased by 33% in patients with CLcr 40 to 60 mL/min and decreased 65% in patients with CLcr 20 to 39 mL/min. The effect on topotecan pharmacokinetics in patients with CLcr less than 20 mL/min is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clinical Studies</span></p><p>No clinically significant changes in topotecan pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered cisplatin with topotecan.</p><p>No clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of free platinum were observed in patients coadministered cisplatin with topotecan.</p><p><span class="Italics">In Vitro Studies</span></p><p>Topotecan does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E, CYP3A, or CYP4A or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.<br/></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity testing of topotecan has not been performed. Topotecan is known to be genotoxic to mammalian cells and is a probable carcinogen. Topotecan was mutagenic to L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells and clastogenic to cultured human lymphocytes with and without metabolic activation. It was also clastogenic to mouse bone marrow. Topotecan did not cause mutations in bacterial cells.</p><p>Topotecan given to female rats prior to mating at an intravenous dose of 1.4 mg/m2 [about equal to the clinical dose based on body surface area (BSA)] caused superovulation possibly related to inhibition of follicular atresia. This dose given to pregnant female rats also caused increased pre-implantation loss. Studies in dogs given at an intravenous dose of 0.4 mg/m2 (about 0.25 times the clinical dose based on BSA) of topotecan daily for a month suggest that treatment may cause an increase in the incidence of multinucleated spermatogonial giant cells in the testes.<br/></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Ovarian Cancer</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of topotecan was evaluated in two clinical trials of 223 patients with metastatic ovarian cancer. All patients had disease that had recurred on, or was unresponsive to, a platinum-containing regimen. Patients in these trials received an initial dose of 1.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> as an intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle.</p><p>One trial (Study 039) was a randomized trial of 112 patients who received topotecan and of 114 patients who received paclitaxel (175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenously over 3 hours on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle). All patients had recurrent ovarian cancer after a platinum-containing regimen or had not responded to at least 1 prior platinum-containing regimen. Patients who did not respond to the trial therapy, or who progressed, could be given the alternative treatment. The efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate, response duration, time to progression, and overall survival (OS).</p><p>The results of the trial did not show statistically significant improvements in response rates, response duration, time to progression, and OS as shown in Table 4.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Parameter</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Topotecan</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 112)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Paclitaxel (n = 114)</span></p><p class="First">Overall response rate (95% CI)</p><p class="First">21% (13%, 28%)</p><p class="First">14% (8%, 20%)</p><p class="First">Complete response rate</p><p class="First">5%</p><p class="First">3%</p><p class="First">Partial response rate</p><p class="First">16%</p><p class="First">11%</p><p class="First">Response durationa (months)</p><p>Median (95% CI)</p><p class="First">6 (5.1, 7.6)</p><p class="First">5 (3.7, 7.8)</p><p class="First">Time to progression (months)</p><p>Median (95% CI)</p><p>Hazard ratio (95% CI)</p><p class="First"><br/>
