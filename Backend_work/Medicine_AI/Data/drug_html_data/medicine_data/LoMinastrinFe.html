</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Lo Minastrin Fe</h2><p>Norethindrone, ethinyl estradiol, and ferrous fumarate combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, and when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.</p><p>This medicine also contains ferrous fumarate. Ferrous fumarate is an iron supplement.</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than birth control pills. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.</p><p>This medicine does not protect against HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Lo Minastrin Fe</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

This medicine may be used for birth control in teenage females but should not be used before the start of menstruation.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of norethindrone, ethinyl estradiol, and ferrous fumarate combination have not been performed in the geriatric population.
