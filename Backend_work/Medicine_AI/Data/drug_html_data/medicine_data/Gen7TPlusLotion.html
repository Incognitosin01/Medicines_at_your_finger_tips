Lidocaine is present in a 3.5% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide and has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O. The molecular weight of lidocaine is 234.34 g/mol. Lidocaine has an octanol: water partition ration of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure:</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">**</span><span class="Bold Underline"> </span><span class="Bold Underline">Lidocaine</span><span class="Bold Underline"> </span><span class="Bold Underline">**</span></p><p> </p><p>Menthol is present in a 7% concentration (w/w). The chemical name is (1R,2S,5R)‐2‐isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol. The empirical formula for Menthol is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol. Menthol contains colorless, hexangonal crystals, usually needle-like; fused masses or crystalline powder with a pleasant, peppermint-like odor. It has a melting point between 31<span class="Sup">O</span>C to 36<span class="Sup">O</span>C and has the following structure:</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">**</span> <span class="Bold Underline">Menthol</span> <span class="Bold Underline">**</span><span class="Bold Underline"> </span></p><p></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities. It also acts as a weak kappa (ĸ) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol chemically triggers the cold-sensitive TRPM-‐8 receptors in the skin, which are responsible for the well-‐documented cooling sensation that occurs when applied to the skin. Menthol’s analgesic properties are not fully understood; however, they are mediated through a selective activation of ĸ-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-‐sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Menthol works by targeting the k‐opioid receptor on the TRPM8 neuron. The TRPM8 neuron is normally activated at temperatures between (8°-28°C). Menthol causes the neuron to fire at temperatures above normal activation, which triggers the characteristic cooling sensation. Also because of menthol's specific targeting of the k‐opioid receptor, it is endowed with analgesic properties.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Lidocaine is an amide-‐type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">The penetration of Lidocaine into intact skin after application of patch is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block.</span></p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span> <span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Sup">®</span> is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to lidocaine, or any of the topical amide-like local anesthetic preparations or to any other component of the product.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Because of the possibility of sedation, patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of heavy machinery or automobiles, and any activities made hazardous by decreased alertness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Disease:</span> Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of Lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize Lidocaine normally.</p><p><span class="Bold">Allergic Reactions:</span> Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to Lidocaine. However, this product should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain.</p><p><span class="Bold">Non-intact Skin:</span> Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of Lidocaine from increased absorption. <span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span> <span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup"> </span>is only recommended for use on intact skin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Eye Exposure:</span> The contact of this product with the eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritations with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns.</p><p><span class="Bold">External Heat Sources:</span> Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over application area is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma Lidocaine levels.</p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antiarrhythmic Drugs:</span> <span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span> <span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup"> </span>should be used with caution in patients receiving Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic.</p><p><span class="Bold">Local Anesthetics:</span> When <span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span> <span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup"> </span>is used concurrently with other products containing local anesthetic agents the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:</h3><p class="First">A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application topical lidocaine. The effect of <span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span> <span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup"> </span>on fertility has not been studied.</p><h3>PREGNANCY:</h3><p class="First">The safety of <span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> has not been established during pregnancy. There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women. <span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span> <span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup"> </span>should not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely needed and discussed with a physician.</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS:</h3><p class="First">The effect of Gen7T Plus Lotion<span class="Sup">®</span> on the nursing infant has not been evaluated. Caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span> <span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Sup">®</span><span class="Sup"> </span>is administered to a nursing mother.</p><h3>PEDIATRIC / GERIATRIC USE:</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric and geriatric patients have not been established.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions are application site reactions, including dermatitis, itching or scaling. These tend to be dose-limiting and diminish with time.</p><p>Serious adverse experiences following the administration of Gen7T Plus Lotion<span class="Sup">®</span> are similar in nature to those observed in other amide anesthetic-containing agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption, or may result from hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy, or a diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">There have been no reports of over-dosage with Gen7T Plus Lotion<span class="Sup">®</span>. Signs of overdosage would include vomiting, drowsiness, coma, respiratory depression, and seizures. In the case of an overdosage, discontinue the product immediately, treat the patient symptomatically, and institute supportive measures.</span></p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gen7T Plus</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Lotion</span><span class="Sup">®</span> is supplied in the following dosage form:</p><p>120 grams</p><p>Made in USA</p><p><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p>Manufactured for:</p><p>7T Pharma, LLC</p><p>220 Emerald Vista Way</p><p>Las Vegas, NV 89144</p><p>800.941.2848</p><p>NDC: 70645-629-35 Size: 120 grams</p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL</h2><p class="First">NDC 70645-629-35<br/>
