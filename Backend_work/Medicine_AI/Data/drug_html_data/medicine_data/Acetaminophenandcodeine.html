</ul><p>severe asthma or breathing problems; or</p><p>a blockage in your stomach or intestines.</p><p>In some people, codeine breaks down rapidly in the liver and reaches higher than normal levels in the body.

<li>
<p>alcoholism or drug addiction;</p>

Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p><b>Do not breastfeed.</b> Codeine can pass into breast milk and cause drowsiness, breathing problems, or death in a nursing baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take acetaminophen and codeine?</h2><p>Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use  acetaminophen and codeine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. An overdose can damage your liver or cause death. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to use more of this medicine.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.</p><p>If you need surgery or medical tests, tell the surgeon or doctor ahead of time that you are using this medicine.</p><p>Do not stop using acetaminophen and codeine suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of your medicine. You should be aware if anyone is using it improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush the unused medicine down the toilet.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since this medicine is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An opioid overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include severe drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, slow breathing, or no breathing.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you get naloxone (a medicine to reverse an opioid overdose) and keep it with you at all times. A person caring for you can give the naloxone if you stop breathing or don't wake up. Your caregiver must still get emergency medical help and may need to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on you while waiting for help to arrive.</p><p>Anyone can buy naloxone from a pharmacy or local health department. Make sure any person caring for you knows where you keep naloxone and how to use it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking acetaminophen and codeine?</h2><p>Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how  acetaminophen and codeine will affect you.

A person caring for you should give naloxone and/or seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up.</p><p><b>In rare cases, acetaminophen may cause a severe skin reaction that can be fatal.</b> This could occur even if you have taken acetaminophen in the past and had no reaction. <b>Stop taking this medicine and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling.</b></p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
