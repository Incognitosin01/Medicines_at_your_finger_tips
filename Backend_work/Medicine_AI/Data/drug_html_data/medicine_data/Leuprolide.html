Leuprolide reduces the amount of testosterone in men or estrogen in women.</p><p>Leuprolide is used in men to treat the symptoms of prostate cancer (but does not treat the cancer itself). Leuprolide is used in women to treat symptoms of endometriosis (overgrowth of uterine lining outside of the uterus) or uterine fibroids.</p><p>Leuprolide is also used to treat precocious (early-onset) puberty in both male and female children at least 2 years old.</p><p>Leuprolide may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Your symptoms may become temporarily worse when you first start using leuprolide.
