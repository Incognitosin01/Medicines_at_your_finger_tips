These reactions have occurred during or immediately after administration and may occur at any time during the course of therapy, including after the first dose. Monitor patients in a healthcare setting for 30 minutes after each injection .</p><p>Warning: Blood Pressure IncreasesTestosterone enanthate can cause blood pressure (BP) increases that can increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death.Before initiating testosterone enanthate, consider the patient’s baseline cardiovascular risk and ensure blood pressure is adequately controlled.Periodically monitor for and treat new-onset hypertension or exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension and re-evaluate whether the benefits of testosterone enanthate outweigh its risks in patients who develop cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease on treatment.Due to this risk, use testosterone enanthate only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
