The eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Clarithromycin tablets in combination with amoxicillin and PREVACID (lansoprazole) or PRILOSEC (omeprazole) delayed-release capsules, as triple therapy, are indicated for the treatment of patients with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or five-year history of duodenal ulcer) to eradicate <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span>.</li>
<li>Clarithromycin tablets in combination with PRILOSEC (omeprazole) capsules are indicated for the treatment of patients with an active duodenal ulcer associated with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> infection. Regimens which contain clarithromycin tablets as the single antibacterial agent are more likely to be associated with the development of clarithromycin resistance among patients who fail therapy. Clarithromycin-containing regimens should not be used in patients with known or suspected clarithromycin resistant isolates because the efficacy of treatment is reduced in this setting.</li>
</ul><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin extended-release tablets are indicated only for acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The efficacy and safety of clarithromycin extended-release tablets in treating other infections for which clarithromycin tablets and clarithromycin for oral suspension are approved have not been established.</p><p>There is resistance to macrolides in certain bacterial infections caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> and <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>. Susceptibility testing should be performed when clinically indicated.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clarithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, clarithromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Clarithromycin ER Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin tablets, USP and clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP may be given with or without food.</p><p>Clarithromycin extended-release tablets, USP should be taken with food.

Fatalities have been reported.</p><h3>Cholestatic Jaundice/Hepatic Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin.</p><h3>Colchicine</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.</p><h3>HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Do not use clarithromycin concomitantly with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 (lovastatin or simvastatin), due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Ergot Alkaloids</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Contraindications for Coadministered Drugs</h3><p class="First">For information about contraindications of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to their full prescribing information (contraindications section).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">In the event of severe acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Henoch-Schonlein purpura, discontinue clarithromycin therapy immediately and institute appropriate treatment.</p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Cases of <span class="Italics">torsades de pointes</span> have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving clarithromycin. Fatalities have been reported.</p><p>Avoid clarithromycin in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including <span class="Italics">torsades de pointes</span></li>
<li>patients receiving drugs known to prolong the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see also Contraindications (4.2)]</span></li>
<li>patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.</li>
</ul><p>Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In some instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. Symptoms of hepatitis can include anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen. Discontinue clarithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.</p><h3>Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Concomitant Use with Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4:</span> Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; hypoglycemia with disopyramide; hypotension and acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine). Most reports of acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 involved elderly patients 65 years of age or older. Use clarithromycin with caution when administered concurrently with medications that induce the cytochrome CYP3A4 enzyme. The use of clarithromycin with simvastatin, lovastatin, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.5, 4.6) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Colchicine:</span> Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If coadministration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, reduce the dose of colchicine. Monitor patients for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.4) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins):</span> Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.5)]</span> as these statins are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases their plasma concentration, which increases the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with these statins. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment.</p><p>Exercise caution when prescribing clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin. In situations where the concomitant use of clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin cannot be avoided, atorvastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily and pravastatin dose should not exceed 40 mg daily. Use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g. fluvastatin) can be considered. It is recommended to prescribe the lowest registered dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oral Hypoglycemic Agents/Insulin:</span> The concomitant use of clarithromycin and oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin can result in significant hypoglycemia. With certain hypoglycemic drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause hypoglycemia when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Quetiapine:</span> Use quetiapine and clarithromycin concomitantly with caution. Coadministration could result in increased quetiapine exposure and quetiapine related toxicities such as somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, altered state of consciousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation. Refer to quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on dose reduction if coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oral Anticoagulants:</span> There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in INR and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is coadministered with warfarin. Monitor INR and prothrombin times frequently while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants concurrently <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Benzodiazepines:</span> Increased sedation and prolongation of sedation have been reported with concomitant administration of clarithromycin and triazolobenzodiazepines, such as triazolam and midazolam <span class="Italics">[see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Embryofetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women except in clinical circumstances where no alternative therapy is appropriate. If clarithromycin is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while the patient is taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Clarithromycin has demonstrated adverse effects on pregnancy outcome and/or embryo-fetal development in monkeys, rats, mice, and rabbits at doses that produced plasma levels 2 times to 17 times the serum levels achieved in humans treated at the maximum recommended human doses <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin therapy.</p><h3>Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing clarithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Based on pooled data across all indications, the most frequent adverse reactions for both adult and pediatric populations observed in clinical trials are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and dysgeusia. Also reported were dyspepsia, liver function test abnormal, anaphylactic reaction, candidiasis, headache, insomnia, and rash.</p><p>The subsequent subsections list the most common adverse reactions for prophylaxis and treatment of mycobacterial infections and duodenal ulcer associated with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> infection. In general, these profiles are consistent with the pooled data described above.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prophylaxis of Mycobacterial Infections</span></p><p>In AIDS patients treated with clarithromycin over long periods of time for prophylaxis against <span class="Italics">M. avium</span>, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse reactions possibly associated with clarithromycin administration from underlying HIV disease or intercurrent illness. Median duration of treatment was 10.6 months for the clarithromycin group and 8.2 months for the placebo group.</p><p>Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 18% of patients receiving clarithromycin compared to 17% of patients receiving placebo in this trial. Primary reasons for discontinuation in clarithromycin treated patients include headache, nausea, vomiting, depression, and taste perversion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Changes in Laboratory Values</span></p><p>Selected laboratory adverse experiences that were reported during therapy in greater than 2% of adult patients treated with clarithromycin in a randomized double-blind clinical trial involving 682 patients are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 5</span>.</p><p>In immunocompromised patients receiving prophylaxis against <span class="Italics">M. avium</span>, evaluations of laboratory values were made by analyzing those values outside the seriously abnormal value (i.e., the extreme high or low limit) for the specified test.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment of Mycobacterial Infections</span></p><p>The adverse reaction profiles for both the 500 mg and 1,000 mg twice a day dose regimens were similar.</p><p>In AIDS patients and other immunocompromised patients treated with the higher doses of clarithromycin over long periods of time for mycobacterial infections, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse reactions possibly associated with clarithromycin administration from underlying signs of HIV disease or intercurrent illness.</p><p>The following analysis summarizes experience during the first 12 weeks of therapy with clarithromycin. Data are reported separately for trial 1 (randomized, double-blind) and trial 2 (open labeled, compassionate use) and also combined. Adverse reactions were reported less frequently in trial 2, which may be due in part to differences in monitoring between the two studies.</p><p>In adult patients receiving clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day, the most frequently reported adverse reactions, considered possibly or possibly related to study drug, with an incidence of 5% or greater, are listed below (<span class="Bold">Table 6</span>). Approximately 8% of the patients who received 500 mg twice a day and 12% of the patients who received 1,000 mg twice a day discontinued therapy due to drug related adverse reactions during the first 12 weeks of therapy; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in at least 2 patients included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, and asthenia.</p><p>A limited number of pediatric AIDS patients have been treated with clarithromycin suspension for mycobacterial infections. The most frequently reported adverse reactions excluding those due to the patient's concurrent conditions were consistent with those observed in adult patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Changes in Laboratory Values</span></p><p>In the first 12 weeks of starting on clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day, 3% of patients has SGOT increases and 2% of patients has SGPT increases &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal in trial 2 (469 enrolled adult patients) while trial 1 (154 enrolled patients) had no elevation of transaminases. This includes only patients with baseline values within the normal range or borderline low.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Duodenal ulcer associated with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> Infection</span></p><p>In clinical trials using combination therapy with clarithromycin plus omeprazole and amoxicillin, no adverse reactions specific to the combination of these drugs have been observed.

Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (2 and 4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively) during gestation days 6 to 15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mg/kg/day. The 1,000 mg/kg/day exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels.

The development and health benefits of human milk feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clarithromycin and any potential adverse effects on the human milk fed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p>Clarithromycin and its active metabolite 14-hydroxy clarithromycin are excreted in human milk. Serum and milk samples were obtained after 3 days of treatment, at steady-state, from one published study of 12 lactating women who were taking clarithromycin 250 mg orally twice daily. Based on the limited data from this study, and assuming milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an exclusively human milk fed infant would receive an estimated average of 136 mcg/kg/day of clarithromycin and its active metabolite, with this maternal dosage regimen. This is less than 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (7.8 mg/kg/day, based on the average maternal weight of 64 kg), and less than 1% of the pediatric dose (15 mg/kg/day) for children greater than 6 months of age.</p><p>A prospective observational study of 55 breastfed infants of mothers taking a macrolide antibacterial (6 were exposed to clarithromycin) were compared to 36 breastfed infants of mothers taking amoxicillin.

These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known age-related decreases in renal function. In clinical trials, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse reactions when compared to younger patients.

For a single 500 mg dose of clarithromycin, food slightly delays the onset of clarithromycin absorption, increasing the peak time from approximately 2 to 2.5 hours. Food also increases the clarithromycin peak plasma concentration by about 24%, but does not affect the extent of clarithromycin bioavailability. Food does not affect the onset of formation of the active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin or its peak plasma concentration but does slightly decrease the extent of metabolite formation, indicated by an 11% decrease in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Therefore, clarithromycin tablets may be given without regard to food. In non-fasting healthy human subjects (males and females), peak plasma concentrations were attained within 2 to 3 hours after oral dosing.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clarithromycin Extended-Release Tablets</span></p><p>Clarithromycin extended-release tablets provide extended absorption of clarithromycin from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Relative to an equal total daily dose of immediate-release clarithromycin tablets, clarithromycin extended-release tablets provide lower and later steady-state peak plasma concentrations but equivalent 24 hour AUCs for both clarithromycin and its microbiologically-active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin. While the extent of formation of 14-OH clarithromycin following administration of clarithromycin extended-release tablets (2 × 500 mg tablets once daily) is not affected by food, administration under fasting conditions is associated with approximately 30% lower clarithromycin AUC relative to administration with food. Therefore, clarithromycin extended-release tablets should be taken with food.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 2: Steady-State Clarithromycin Plasma Concentration-Time Profiles</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clarithromycin for Oral Suspension</span></p><p>When 250 mg doses of clarithromycin as clarithromycin suspension were administered to fasting healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations were attained around 3 hours after dosing.</p><p>For adult patients, the bioavailability of 10 mL of the 125 mg/5 mL suspension or 10 mL of the 250 mg/5 mL suspension is similar to a 250 mg or 500 mg tablet, respectively.</p><p>In adults given 250 mg clarithromycin as suspension (n = 22), food appeared to decrease mean peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations from 1.2 (± 0.4) mcg/mL to 1.0 (± 0.4) mcg/mL and the extent of absorption from 7.2 (± 2.5) hr∙mcg/mL to 6.5 (± 3.7) hr∙mcg/mL.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Clarithromycin and the 14-OH clarithromycin metabolite distribute readily into body tissues and fluids.

The elimination half-life of clarithromycin was about 3 hours to 4 hours with 250 mg administered every 12 hours but increased to 5 hours to 7 hours with 500 mg administered every 8 hours to 12 hours. The nonlinearity of clarithromycin pharmacokinetics is slight at the recommended doses of 250 mg and 500 mg administered every 8 hours to 12 hours. With a 250 mg every 12 hours dosing, the principal metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin, attains a peak steady-state concentration of about 0.6 mcg/mL and has an elimination half-life of 5 hours to 6 hours. With a 500 mg every 8 hours to 12 hours dosing, the peak steady-state concentration of 14-OH clarithromycin is slightly higher (up to 1 mcg/mL), and its elimination half-life is about 7 hours to 9 hours. With any of these dosing regimens, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 days to 4 days.</p><p>After a 250 mg tablet every 12 hours, approximately 20% of the dose is excreted in the urine as clarithromycin, while after a 500 mg tablet every 12 hours, the urinary excretion of clarithromycin is somewhat greater, approximately 30%. In comparison, after an oral dose of 250 mg (125 mg/5 mL) suspension every 12 hours, approximately 40% is excreted in urine as clarithromycin. The renal clearance of clarithromycin is, however, relatively independent of the dose size and approximates the normal glomerular filtration rate. The major metabolite found in urine is 14-OH clarithromycin, which accounts for an additional 10% to 15% of the dose with either a 250 mg or a 500 mg tablet administered every 12 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clarithromycin Extended-Release Tablets</span></p><p>In healthy human subjects, steady-state peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations of approximately 2 mcg/mL to 3 mcg/mL were achieved about 5 hours to 8 hours after oral administration of 1,000 mg clarithromycin extended-release tablets once daily; for 14-OH clarithromycin, steady-state peak plasma concentrations of approximately 0.8 mcg/mL were attained about 6 hours to 9 hours after dosing. Steady-state peak plasma clarithromycin concentrations of approximately 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL were achieved about 5 hours to 6 hours after oral administration of a single 500 mg clarithromycin extended-release tablets once daily; for 14-OH clarithromycin, steady-state peak plasma concentrations of approximately 0.6 mcg/mL were attained about 6 hours after dosing.</p><p>Steady-state peak plasma concentrations were attained in 2 days to 3 days and were approximately 2 mcg/mL for clarithromycin and 0.7 mcg/mL for 14-OH clarithromycin when 250 mg doses of the clarithromycin suspension were administered every 12 hours.

These trials accrued patients from May 1991 to March 1992. Trial 500 was a randomized, double-blind trial; trial 577 was an open-label compassionate use trial. Both trials used 500 mg and 1,000 mg twice daily dosing of clarithromycin; trial 1 also had a 2,000 mg twice daily clarithromycin group. Trial 1 enrolled 154 adult patients and trial 2 enrolled 469 adult patients. The majority of patients had CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts less than 50 cells/mcL at study entry.

This 24-week trial enrolled 106 patients with AIDS and dMAC, with 55 patients randomized to receive clarithromycin and ethambutol, and 51 patients randomized to receive clarithromycin, ethambutol, and clofazime. Baseline characteristics between treatment arms were similar with the exception of median CFU counts being at least 1 log higher in the clarithromycin, ethambutol, and clofazime arm.</p><p>Compared to prior experience with clarithromycin monotherapy, the two-drug regimen of clarithromycin and ethambutol extended the time to microbiologic relapse, largely through suppressing the emergence of clarithromycin resistant strains. However, the addition of clofazimine to the regimen added no additional microbiologic or clinical benefit. Tolerability of both multidrug regimens was comparable with the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal in nature. Patients receiving the clofazimine-containing regimen had reduced survival rates; however, their baseline mycobacterial colony counts were higher. The results of this trial support the addition of ethambutol to clarithromycin for the treatment of initial dMAC infections but do not support adding clofazimine as a third agent.</p><h3>Otitis Media</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Otitis Media Trial of Clarithromycin vs. Oral Cephalosporin</span></p><p>In a controlled clinical trial of pediatric patients with acute otitis media performed in the United States, where significant rates of beta-lactamase producing organisms were found, clarithromycin was compared to an oral cephalosporin.

<li>Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including clarithromycin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clarithromycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clarithromycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</li>
<li>Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials including clarithromycin which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Advise patients that clarithromycin may interact with some drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medications.</li>
<li>Advise patients that clarithromycin tablets and oral suspension can be taken with or without food and can be taken with milk; however, clarithromycin extended-release tablets should be taken with food. Do not refrigerate the suspension.</li>
<li>There are no data on the effect of clarithromycin on the ability to drive or use machines. However, counsel patients regarding the potential for dizziness, vertigo, confusion and disorientation, which may occur with the medication. The potential for these adverse reactions should be taken into account before patients drive or use machines.</li>
