It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>Beclomethasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Beclovent</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

<li>Wipe the mouthpiece dry with a cloth or tissue. Do not wash it with water. Put the cap back on right away.</li>
<li>Gargle and rinse your mouth with water after each dose.</li>
