</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride Injection</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">1.1 Intensive Care Unit Sedation</span><br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection is indicated for sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in an intensive care setting. Dexmedetomidine injection should be administered by continuous infusion not to exceed 24 hours.<br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection has been continuously infused in mechanically ventilated patients prior to extubation, during extubation, and post-extubation. It is not necessary to discontinue dexmedetomidine injection prior to extubation.<br/>
<span class="Bold">1.2 Procedural Sedation</span><br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection is indicated for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures.</p><h2>Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">2.1 Dosing Guidelines</span><br/>
• Dexmedetomidine injection dosing should be individualized and titrated to desired clinical response.<br/>
• Dexmedetomidine injection is not indicated for infusions lasting longer than 24 hours.<br/>
• Dexmedetomidine injection should be administered using a controlled infusion device.<br/>
<span class="Bold">2.2 Dosage Information</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Dosage Information</span></p><p><span class="Bold">2.3 Dosage Adjustment</span><br/>
Due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine injection or other concomitant anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics or opioids may be required when co-administered <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span>7.1<span class="Italics">)].</span><br/>
Dosage reductions may need to be considered for adult patients with hepatic impairment, and geriatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.7<span class="Italics">), Use in Specific Populations (</span>8.6<span class="Italics">), Clinical Pharmacology (</span>12.3<span class="Italics">)].</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">2.4 Preparation of Solution</span><br/>
Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling of dexmedetomidine injection.<br/>
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Dexmedetomidine Injection, 200 mcg/2 mL (100 mcg/mL)</span></p><p>Dexmedetomidine injection must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection to achieve required concentration (4 mcg/mL) prior to administration. Preparation of solutions is the same, whether for the loading dose or maintenance infusion.<br/>
To prepare the infusion, withdraw 2 mL of dexmedetomidine injection, and add to 48 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection to a total of 50 mL. Shake gently to mix well.<br/>
<span class="Bold">2.5 Administration with Other Fluids</span><br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection infusion should not be co-administered through the same intravenous catheter with blood or plasma because physical compatibility has not been established.<br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection has been shown to be incompatible when administered with the following drugs: amphotericin B, diazepam.<br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection has been shown to be compatible when administered with the following intravenous fluids:<br/>
• 0.9% sodium chloride in water<br/>
• 5% dextrose in water<br/>
• 20% mannitol<br/>
• Lactated Ringer’s solution<br/>
• 100 mg/mL magnesium sulfate solution<br/>
• 0.3% potassium chloride solution<br/>
<span class="Bold">2.6 Compatibility with Natural Rubber</span><br/>
Compatibility studies have demonstrated the potential for absorption of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride to some types of natural rubber. Although dexmedetomidine injection is dosed to effect, it is advisable to use administration components made with synthetic or coated natural rubber gaskets.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Dexmedetomidine Injection, USP is clear and colorless and is available as follows.<br/>
Dexmedetomidine Injection, USP 200 mcg/2 mL (100 mcg/mL) in a glass vial with pink cap. To be used after dilution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">5.1 Drug Administration</span><br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of dexmedetomidine injection, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving dexmedetomidine injection.<br/>
<span class="Bold">5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest</span><br/>
Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with dexmedetomidine injection administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration.<br/>
Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with dexmedetomidine injection infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of dexmedetomidine injection, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because dexmedetomidine injection has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required.<br/>
Caution should be exercised when administering dexmedetomidine injection to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because dexmedetomidine injection decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients.<br/>
In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with dexmedetomidine injection an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with dexmedetomidine injection.<br/>
<span class="Bold">5.3 Transient Hypertension</span><br/>
Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of dexmedetomidine injection. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable.<br/>
<span class="Bold">5.4 Arousability</span><br/>
Some patients receiving dexmedetomidine injection have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms.<br/>
<span class="Bold">5.5 Withdrawal</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Intensive Care Unit Sedation</span><br/>
With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) dexmedetomidine injection adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) dexmedetomidine injection adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation.<br/>
In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of &lt;5%. If tachycardia and/or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of dexmedetomidine injection supportive therapy is indicated.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Procedural Sedation</span><br/>
In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short-term infusions of dexmedetomidine injection (&lt;6 hours).<br/>
<span class="Bold">5.6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis</span><br/>
Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.1<span class="Italics">)].</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">5.7 Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
Since dexmedetomidine clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span>2.2, 2.3<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:<br/>
• Hypotension, bradycardia and sinus arrest [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">)]</span><br/>
• Transient hypertension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.3<span class="Italics">)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</span><br/>
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>
Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of patients in both Intensive Care Unit and procedural sedation studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Intensive Care Unit Sedation</span><br/>
Adverse reaction information is derived from the continuous infusion trials of dexmedetomidine injection for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit setting in which 1,007 adult patients received dexmedetomidine injection. The mean total dose was 7.4 mcg/kg (range: 0.8 to 84.1), mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.1 to 6.0) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours (range: 0.2 to 157.2). The population was between 17 to 88 years of age, 43% ≥65 years of age, 77% male and 93% Caucasian. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of &gt;2% are provided in Table 2. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Adverse Reactions with an Incidence &gt;2%-Adult Intensive Care Unit Sedation Population &lt;24 hours*</span></p><p>* 26 subjects in the all dexmedetomidine injection group and 10 subjects in the randomized dexmedetomidine injection group had exposure for greater than 24 hours</p><p>Adverse reaction information was also derived from the placebo-controlled, continuous infusion trials of dexmedetomidine injection for sedation in the surgical intensive care unit setting in which 387 adult patients received dexmedetomidine injection for less than 24 hours. The most frequently observed treatment-emergent adverse events included hypotension, hypertension, nausea, bradycardia, fever, vomiting, hypoxia, tachycardia and anemia (see Table 3).<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 3: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in &gt;1% of All Dexmedetomidine-Treated Adult Patients in the Randomized Placebo-Controlled Continuous Infusion &lt;24 Hours ICU Sedation Studies</span></p><p>In a controlled clinical trial, dexmedetomidine injection was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration in adult patients.

Adverse reaction information is derived from the two trials for procedural sedation [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] in which 318 adult patients received dexmedetomidine injection. The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 to 6.7), mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.3 to 6.1) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 to 6.2). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I-IV, 30% ≥65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian.<br/>
Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of &gt;2% are provided in Table 6. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">)]</span>. Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table.<br/>
The decrease in respiratory rate and hypoxia was similar between dexmedetomidine injection and comparator groups in both studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 6: Adverse Reactions With an Incidence &gt;2%—Procedural Sedation Population</span></p><p><span class="Sup">1</span> Hypotension was defined in absolute and relative terms as Systolic blood pressure of &lt;80 mmHg or ≤30% lower than pre-study drug infusion value, or Diastolic blood pressure of &lt;50 mmHg.<br/>

<span class="Bold">6.2 Postmarketing Experience</span><br/>
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of dexmedetomidine injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Hypotension and bradycardia were the most common adverse reactions associated with the use of dexmedetomidine injection during post approval use of the drug.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 7: Adverse Reactions Experienced During Post-Approval Use of Dexmedetomidine Injection</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">7.1 Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids</span><br/>
Co-administration of dexmedetomidine injection with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine injection and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with dexmedetomidine injection, a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine injection or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required.<br/>
<span class="Bold">7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers</span><br/>
In one study of 10 healthy adult volunteers, administration of dexmedetomidine injection for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">8.1 Pregnancy</span><br/>
Pregnancy Category C<br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of dexmedetomidine injection use in pregnant women. In an in vitro human placenta study, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine occurred. In a study in the pregnant rat, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine was observed when radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously. Thus, fetal exposure should be expected in humans, and dexmedetomidine injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus.<br/>
Teratogenic effects were not observed in rats following subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis (from gestation day 5 to 16) with doses up to 200 mcg/kg (representing a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or in rabbits following intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis (from gestation day 6 to 18) with doses up to 96 mcg/kg (representing approximately half the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose based on plasma area under the time-curve comparison). However, fetal toxicity, as evidenced by increased post-implantation losses and reduced live pups, was observed in rats at a subcutaneous dose of 200 mcg/kg. The no-effect dose in rats was 20 mcg/kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison). In another reproductive toxicity study when dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats at 8 and 32 mcg/kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison) from gestation day 16 through weaning, lower offspring weights were observed. Additionally, when offspring of the 32 mcg/kg group were allowed to mate, elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development was observed in second generation offspring.<br/>
<span class="Bold">8.2 Labor and Delivery</span><br/>
The safety of dexmedetomidine injection during labor and delivery has not been studied.<br/>
<span class="Bold">8.3 Nursing Mothers</span><br/>
It is not known whether dexmedetomidine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Radio-labeled dexmedetomidine administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when dexmedetomidine injection is administered to a nursing woman.<br/>
<span class="Bold">8.4 Pediatric Use</span><br/>
Safety and efficacy have not been established for Procedural or ICU Sedation in pediatric patients. One assessor-blinded trial in pediatric patients and two open label studies in neonates were conducted to assess efficacy for ICU sedation. These studies did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints and the safety data submitted were insufficient to fully characterize the safety profile of dexmedetomidine injection for this patient population. The use of dexmedetomidine for procedural sedation in pediatric patients has not been evaluated.<br/>
<span class="Bold">8.5 Geriatric Use</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Intensive Care Unit Sedation</span><br/>
A total of 729 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over. A total of 200 patients were 75 years of age and over. In patients greater than 65 years of age, a higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was observed following administration of dexmedetomidine injection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">)].</span> Therefore, a dose reduction may be considered in patients over 65 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span>2.2, 2.3<span class="Italics">), Clinical Pharmacology (</span>12.3<span class="Italics">)].</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Procedural Sedation</span><br/>
A total of 131 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over. A total of 47 patients were 75 years of age and over. Hypotension occurred in a higher incidence in dexmedetomidine injection-treated patients 65 years or older (72%) and 75 years or older (74%) as compared to patients &lt;65 years (47%). A reduced loading dose of 0.5 mcg/kg given over 10 minutes is recommended and a reduction in the maintenance infusion should be considered for patients greater than 65 years of age.<br/>
<span class="Bold">8.6 Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
Since dexmedetomidine clearance decreases with increasing severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span>2.2, 2.3<span class="Italics">) and Clinical Pharmacology (</span>12.3<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">9.1 Controlled Substance</span><br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) is not a controlled substance.<br/>
<span class="Bold">9.3 Dependence</span><br/>
The dependence potential of dexmedetomidine injection has not been studied in humans. However, since studies in rodents and primates have demonstrated that dexmedetomidine injection exhibits pharmacologic actions similar to those of clonidine, it is possible that dexmedetomidine injection may produce a clonidine-like withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.5<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The tolerability of dexmedetomidine injection was studied in one study in which healthy adult subjects were administered doses at and above the recommended dose of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. The maximum blood concentration achieved in this study was approximately 13 times the upper boundary of the therapeutic range. The most notable effects observed in two subjects who achieved the highest doses were first degree atrioventricular block and second degree heart block. No hemodynamic compromise was noted with the atrioventricular block and the heart block resolved spontaneously within one minute.<br/>
Five adult patients received an overdose of dexmedetomidine injection in the intensive care unit sedation studies. Two of these patients had no symptoms reported; one patient received a 2 mcg/kg loading dose over 10 minutes (twice the recommended loading dose) and one patient received a maintenance infusion of 0.8 mcg/kg/hr. Two other patients who received a 2 mcg/kg loading dose over 10 minutes, experienced bradycardia and/or hypotension. One patient who received a loading bolus dose of undiluted dexmedetomidine injection (19.4 mcg/kg), had cardiac arrest from which he was successfully resuscitated.</p><h2>Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Dexmedetomidine injection, USP (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution suitable for intravenous infusion following dilution. Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride, USP is the S-enantiomer of medetomidine and is chemically described as (+)-4-(S)-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole monohydrochloride. Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride, USP has a molecular weight of 236.7 and the empirical formula is C <span class="Sub">13</span>H <span class="Sub">16</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span> • HCl and the structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride, USP is a solid, white or almost white powder that is freely soluble in water and alcohols, slightly soluble in methylene chloride and acetone and has a pKa of 7.1. Its partition coefficient in-octanol: water at pH 7.4 is 2.89.<br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection, USP is supplied as a clear, colorless, isotonic solution with a pH of 4.5 to 7.0. Each mL contains 118 mcg of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride, USP equivalent to 100 mcg (0.1 mg) of dexmedetomidine and 9 mg of sodium chloride in water and is to be used after dilution. The solution is preservative-free and contains no additives or chemical stabilizers.</p><h2>Dexmedetomidine Hydrochloride Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">12.1 Mechanism of Action</span><br/>
Dexmedetomidine injection is a relatively selective alpha2-adrenergic agonist with sedative properties. Alpha2 selectivity is observed in animals following slow intravenous infusion of low and medium doses (10-300 mcg/kg). Both alpha1 and alpha2 activity is observed following slow intravenous infusion of high doses (≥1000 mcg/kg) or with rapid intravenous administration.<br/>
<span class="Bold">12.2 Pharmacodynamics</span><br/>
In a study in healthy volunteers (N = 10), respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits and there was no evidence of respiratory depression when dexmedetomidine injection was administered by intravenous infusion at doses within the recommended dose range (0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hr).<br/>
<span class="Bold">12.3 Pharmacokinetics</span><br/>
Following intravenous administration, dexmedetomidine exhibits the following pharmacokinetic parameters: a rapid distribution phase with a distribution half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of approximately 6 minutes; a terminal elimination half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of approximately 2 hours; and steady-state volume of distribution (V <span class="Sub">ss</span>) of approximately 118 liters. Clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/h. The mean body weight associated with this clearance estimate was 72 kg.<br/>
Dexmedetomidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the dosage range of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg/hr when administered by intravenous infusion for up to 24 hours. Table 8 shows the main pharmacokinetic parameters when dexmedetomidine injection was infused (after appropriate loading doses) at maintenance infusion rates of 0.17 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 0.3 ng/mL) for 12 and 24 hours, 0.33 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 0.6 ng/mL) for 24 hours, and 0.70 mcg/kg/hr (target plasma concentration of 1.25 ng/mL) for 24 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 8: Mean ± SD Pharmacokinetic Parameters</span></p><p>Abbreviations: t <span class="Sub">1/2</span> = half-life, CL = clearance, Vss = steady-state volume of distribution<br/>
* Presented as harmonic mean and pseudo standard deviation.<br/>
<span class="Sup">#</span> Mean C <span class="Sub">ss</span> = Average steady-state concentration of dexmedetomidine. The mean C <span class="Sub">ss</span> was calculated based on post-dose sampling from 2.5 to 9 hours samples for 12 hours infusion and post-dose sampling from 2.5 to 18 hours for 24 hour infusions.<br/>
The loading doses for each of the above indicated groups were 0.5, 0.5, 1 and 2.2 mcg/kg, respectively.<br/>
Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic parameters after dexmedetomidine injection maintenance doses of 0.2 to 1.4 mcg/kg/hr for &gt;24 hours were similar to the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after dexmedetomidine injection maintenance dosing for &lt;24 hours in other studies. The values for clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V), and t <span class="Sub">1/2</span> were 39.4 L/hr, 152 L, and 2.67 hours, respectively.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
The steady-state volume of distribution (V <span class="Sub">ss</span>) of dexmedetomidine was approximately 118 liters. Dexmedetomidine protein binding was assessed in the plasma of normal healthy male and female subjects. The average protein binding was 94% and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested. Protein binding was similar in males and females. The fraction of dexmedetomidine that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects.</p><p>The potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by fentanyl, ketorolac, theophylline, digoxin and lidocaine was explored <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of dexmedetomidine were observed. The potential for protein binding displacement of phenytoin, warfarin, ibuprofen, propranolol, theophylline and digoxin by dexmedetomidine was explored <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by dexmedetomidine.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><br/>
Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces. Biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism. The major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are: direct N-glucuronidation to inactive metabolites; aliphatic hydroxylation (mediated primarily by CYP2A6 with a minor role of CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19) of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxy-dexmedetomidine; and N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to generate 3-hydroxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl-dexmedetomidine, and dexmedetomidine-N-methyl O-glucuronide.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Excretion</span><br/>
The terminal elimination half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of dexmedetomidine is approximately 2 hours and clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L/h. A mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of 95% of the radioactivity, following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine, was recovered in the urine and 4% in the feces. No unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine. Approximately 85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within 24 hours after the infusion. Fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of N-glucuronidation accounted for approximately 34% of the cumulative urinary excretion. In addition, aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, the glucuronide of 3-hydroxy-dexmedetomidine, and 3-carboxylic acid-dexmedetomidine together represented approximately 14% of the dose in urine. N-methylation of dexmedetomidine to form 3-hydroxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, 3-carboxy N-methyl dexmedetomidine, and N-methyl O-glucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately 18% of the dose in urine. The N-Methyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine. Approximately 28% of the urinary metabolites have not been identified.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients</span><br/>
There was no observed difference in dexmedetomidine injection pharmacokinetics due to gender.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span><br/>
The pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine injection was not altered by age. There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine injection in young (18–40 years), middle age (41–65 years), and elderly (&gt;65 years) subjects.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
In subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C), clearance values for dexmedetomidine were lower than in healthy subjects. The mean clearance values for patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were 74%, 64% and 53% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively. Mean clearances for free drug were 59%, 51% and 32% of those observed in the normal healthy subjects, respectively.</p><p>Although dexmedetomidine injection is dosed to effect, it may be necessary to consider dose reduction in subjects with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span>2.2<span class="Italics">), Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.7<span class="Italics">)]</span>.<br/>

Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics (C <span class="Sub">max</span>, T <span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>, CL, and Vss) were not significantly different in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance: &lt;30 mL/min) compared to healthy subjects.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span><br/>
In vitro studies: In vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated no evidence of cytochrome P450 mediated drug interactions that are likely to be of clinical relevance.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span><br/>
Animal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dexmedetomidine.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span><br/>
Dexmedetomidine was not mutagenic in vitro, in either the bacterial reverse mutation assay ( <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> and <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span>) or the mammalian cell forward mutation assay (mouse lymphoma). Dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with, but not without, rat S9 metabolic activation. In contrast, dexmedetomidine was not clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with or without human S9 metabolic activation. Although dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test in NMRI mice, there was no evidence of clastogenicity in CD-1 mice.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
Fertility in male or female rats was not affected after daily subcutaneous injections of dexmedetomidine at doses up to 54 mcg/kg (less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose on a mcg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) administered from 10 weeks prior to mating in males, and 3 weeks prior to mating and during mating in females.<br/>
<span class="Bold">13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</span><br/>
There were no differences in the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol response in dogs following a single dose of dexmedetomidine compared to saline control. However, after continuous subcutaneous infusions of dexmedetomidine at 3 mcg/kg/hr and 10 mcg/kg/hr for one week in dogs (exposures estimated to be within the clinical range), the ACTH-stimulated cortisol response was diminished by approximately 27% and 40%, respectively, compared to saline-treated control animals indicating a dose-dependent adrenal suppression.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine injection has been evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials in 1,185 adult patients.<br/>
<span class="Bold">14.1 Intensive Care Unit Sedation</span><br/>
Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials included 754 adult patients being treated in a surgical intensive care unit. All patients were initially intubated and received mechanical ventilation. These trials evaluated the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine injection by comparing the amount of rescue medication (midazolam in one trial and propofol in the second) required to achieve a specified level of sedation (using the standardized Ramsay Sedation Scale) between dexmedetomidine injection and placebo from onset of treatment to extubation or to a total treatment duration of 24 hours. The Ramsay Level of Sedation Scale is displayed in Table 9.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 9: Ramsay Level of Sedation Scale</span></p><p>In the first study, 175 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 178 to receive dexmedetomidine injection by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr (with allowed adjustment between 0.2 and 0.7 mcg/kg/hr) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg/kg intravenous over 10 minutes. The study drug infusion rate was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3. Patients were allowed to receive “rescue” midazolam as needed to augment the study drug infusion. In addition, morphine sulfate was administered for pain as needed. The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication (midazolam) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated. Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more midazolam than patients randomized to dexmedetomidine injection (see Table 10).<br/>
A second prospective primary analysis assessed the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine injection by comparing the percentage of patients who achieved a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3 during intubation without the use of additional rescue medication. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the dexmedetomidine injection group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥3 without receiving any midazolam rescue compared to the placebo group (see Table 10).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 10: Midazolam Use as Rescue Medication During Intubation (ITT)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Study One</span></p><p>ITT (intent-to-treat) population includes all randomized patients<br/>

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the dexmedetomidine injection and placebo groups. On average, dexmedetomidine injection-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.47 versus 0.83 mg/h). In addition, 44% (79 of 178 patients) of dexmedetomidine injection patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 19% (33 of 175 patients) in the placebo group.<br/>
In a second study, 198 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 203 to receive dexmedetomidine injection by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.4 mcg/kg/hr (with allowed adjustment between 0.2 and 0.7 mcg/kg/hr) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg/kg intravenous over 10 minutes.

** Chi-square<br/>
A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the dexmedetomidine injection and placebo groups. On average, dexmedetomidine injection-treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo-treated patients (0.43 versus 0.89 mg/h). In addition, 41% (83 of 203 patients) of dexmedetomidine injection patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 15% (30 of 198 patients) in the placebo group.<br/>
In a controlled clinical trial, dexmedetomidine injection was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration. Dexmedetomidine injection was not shown to be superior to midazolam for the primary efficacy endpoint, the percent of time patients were adequately sedated (81% versus 81%). In addition, administration of dexmedetomidine injection for longer than 24 hours was associated with tolerance, tachyphylaxis, and a dose-related increase in adverse events <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.1<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">14.2 Procedural Sedation</span><br/>
The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine injection for sedation of non-intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other procedures was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. Study 1 evaluated the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine injection in patients having a variety of elective surgeries/procedures performed under monitored anesthesia care. Study 2 evaluated dexmedetomidine injection in patients undergoing awake fiberoptic intubation prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure.<br/>
In Study 1, the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine injection were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients not requiring rescue midazolam to achieve a specified level of sedation using the standardized Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (see Table 12).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 12: Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation</span></p><p class="First">1<br/>
(deep sleep)</p><p>Patients were randomized to receive a loading infusion of either dexmedetomidine injection 1 mcg/kg, dexmedetomidine injection 0.5 mcg/kg, or placebo (normal saline) given over 10 minutes and followed by a maintenance infusion started at 0.6 mcg/kg/hr. The maintenance infusion of study drug could be titrated from 0.2 mcg/kg/hr to 1 mcg/kg/hr to achieve the targeted sedation score (Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale ≤4). Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and/or maintain an Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale ≤4. After achieving the desired level of sedation, a local or regional anesthetic block was performed. Demographic characteristics were similar between the dexmedetomidine injection and comparator groups. Efficacy results showed that dexmedetomidine injection was more effective than the comparator group when used to sedate non-intubated patients requiring monitored anesthesia care during surgical and other procedures (see Table 13).<br/>
In Study 2, the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine injection were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients requiring rescue midazolam to achieve or maintain a specified level of sedation using the Ramsay Sedation Scale score ≥2 (see Table 9). Patients were randomized to receive a loading infusion of dexmedetomidine injection 1 mcg/kg or placebo (normal saline) given over 10 minutes and followed by a fixed maintenance infusion of 0.7 mcg/kg/hr. After achieving the desired level of sedation, topicalization of the airway occurred. Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and/or maintain a Ramsay Sedation Scale ≥2. Demographic characteristics were similar between the dexmedetomidine injection and comparator groups.
