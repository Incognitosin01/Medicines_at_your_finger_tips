</ul><h3>2.2 Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients Not Currently on a Tramadol Product</span></p><p>The initial dose of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are 100 mg once daily. </p><p><span class="Bold">Patients Currently on Tramadol Immediate-Release</span> <span class="Bold">(IR)</span> <span class="Bold">Products</span></p><p>Calculate the 24-hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules rounded down to the next lowest 100 mg increment. The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need.</p><p>Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Opioids to</span> <span class="Bold">Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><p>Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules therapy is initiated. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules 100 mg once a day.</p><h3>2.3 Titration and Maintenance Therapy</h3><p class="First">Individually titrate Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules by 100 mg every five days to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. The maximum daily dose of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules 300 mg per day.</p><p>Continually reevaluate patients receiving  Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">)].</span> Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics.</p><p>Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules dosage.</p><p>If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><h3>2.4 Discontinuation of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules</h3><p class="First"><br/>
When a patient no longer requires therapy with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between doses, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both.

As an opioid, Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse. Because extended-release products such as Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of tramadol present [<span class="Italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (</span><span class="Italics">9</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse or misuse prior to prescribing Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, and monitor all patients receiving Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients are increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as  Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of  Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse and misuse.</p><p>Abuse or misuse of  Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules by splitting, breaking, chewing, crushing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of tramadol and can result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (</span><span class="Italics">10</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispense Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)]</span> Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>5.2 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Prescribers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">• Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">• Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCD.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">• Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">• Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint.</span></p><h3>5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (</span><span class="Italics">10</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Overestimating the Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of tramadol.</p><h3>5.4 Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Tramadol and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children</h3><p class="First">Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Tramadol and codeine are subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to increased exposure to an active metabolite. Based upon postmarketing reports with tramadol or with codeine, children younger than 12 years of age may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with opioids for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to their respiratory depressant effect. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].<br/></li>
<li>Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are contraindicated for post-operative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].<br/></li>
<li>Avoid the use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation, such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression.<br/></li>
<li>As with adults, when prescribing opioids for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of opioid overdose [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.4</span><span class="Italics">), Overdosage</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">10</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</li>
</ul><p>Nursing Mothers</p><p>Tramadol is subject to the same polymorphic metabolism as codeine, with ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates being potentially exposed to life-threatening levels of O-desmethyltramadol (M1). At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. A baby nursing from an ultra-rapid metabolizer mother taking Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules could potentially be exposed to high levels of MI, and experience life-threatening respiratory depression. For this reason, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">8.2</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>CYP2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-rapid metabolizer</p><p>Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). </p><p>These individuals convert tramadol into its active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum M1 levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) [see <span class="Italics">Overdosage (</span><span class="Italics">10</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]. Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules.</p><h3>5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">), Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>5.6 Risks of Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes</h3><p class="First">The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors on levels of tramadol and M1 from Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol which is a weak serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and µ-opioid agonist, and the active metabolite, M1, which is more potent than tramadol in µ-opioid receptor binding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics">].</span> </p><p><span class="Bold">Risks of</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors</span></p><p>The concomitant use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules with all cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine) may result in an increase in tramadol plasma levels and a decrease in the levels of the active metabolite, M1. A decrease in M1 exposure in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and reduced efficacy. The effect of increased tramadol levels may be an increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome.</p><p>Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in tramadol plasma levels and an increase in active metabolite M1 levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.  </p><p>Follow patients receiving Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for the risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity, and opioid withdrawal when Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6 <span class="Italics">[see, Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction</span></p><p>The concomitant use of  Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules with cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in tramadol plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions, increase the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.</p><p>The concomitant use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower tramadol levels.

Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>5.8 Serotonin Syndrome Risk</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported with the use of tramadol, including Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, particularly during concomitant use with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. This may occur within the recommended dosage range.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules if serotonin syndrome is suspected. </p><h3>5.9 Increased Risk of Seizures</h3><p class="First">Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range.</p><p>      Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking: <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span></p><ul class="Square">

Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure.  If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids.  Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers.  Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>5.12 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease</span>: Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cache</span><span class="Bold">c</span><span class="Bold">tic, or Debilitated Patients:</span> Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules and when Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.

Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules. In patients with circulatory shock, Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>5.14 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span><span class="Sup"> </span>retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>5.15 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The tramadol in Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>5.16 Anaphylaxis and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and rarely fatal hypersensitive reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported hypersensitivity reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tramadol and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules immediately, discontinue Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of tramadol.

Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions.

Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare providers. “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction.  Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. </p><p>Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to</span> <span class="Bold">Abuse of</span> <span class="Bold">Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules</span></p><p>Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are for oral use only. The abuse of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. With intravenous abuse, the inactive ingredients in Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules can result in local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, embolism and death, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>9.3 Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient <span class="Italics">[se</span><span class="Italics">e Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.4</span><span class="Italics">)].</span> If Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, withdrawal syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h2>10 OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></span></p><p>Acute overdosage with Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, QT prolongation, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment</span> <span class="Bold">of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdosage, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose.   For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to tramadol overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.  Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to tramadol overdose.</p><p>While naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by overdosage with tramadol, the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration. In animals, convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules could be suppressed with barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone. Naloxone administration did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice. Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an overdose because it removes less than 7% of the administered dose in a 4-hour dialysis period.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of tramadol in Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished.  Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules will continue to release tramadol and add to the tramadol load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist. </p><h2>11 DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are an opioid agonist   in an extended-release oral formulation.

The n-octanol/water log partition coefficient (logP) is 1.35 at pH 7.  </p><p>Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules contain a total dose of tramadol hydrochloride 150 mg in a combination of immediate-release and extended-release components.</p><p>Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are white in color. Inactive ingredients include gelatin, titanium dioxide, shellac, yellow iron oxide, lactose monohydrate 200 mesh, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone K30, corn starch, sodium starch glycolate, magnesium stearate, sucrose stearate, hypromellose, talc, polysorbate 80, Eudragit NE 30D, and simethicone emulsion.</p><h2>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules contains tramadol, an opioid agonist, and an inhibitor of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to µ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.</p><p>Opioid activity of tramadol is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to µ-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opioid antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound.</p><p>Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol. The relationship between exposure of tramadol and M1 and efficacy has not been evaluated in clinical studies.</p><p>Apart from analgesia, tramadol administration may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. In contrast to morphine, tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Tramadol produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p>The effect of oral tramadol on the QTcF interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, four-way crossover, placebo- and positive- (moxifloxacin) controlled study in 68 adult male and female healthy subjects. At a 600 mg/day dose (1.5-fold the maximum immediate-release daily dose), the study demonstrated no significant effect on the QTcF interval.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">)].</span> They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span> </p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models.

Approximately 7% of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P-450 metabolizing enzyme system. These individuals are “poor metabolizers” of debrisoquine, dextromethorphan and tricyclic antidepressants, among other drugs. Based on a population PK analysis of Phase 1 studies with IR tablets in healthy subjects, concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20% higher in "poor metabolizers" versus "extensive metabolizers," while M1 concentrations were 40% lower.</p><p><span class="Italics">CYP2D6 Inhibitors</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol.</p><p><span class="Italics">Quinidine</span></p><p>Tramadol is metabolized to active metabolite M1 by CYP2D6.

A slight but statistically significant increase in two common murine tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in an NMRI mouse carcinogenicity study, particularly in aged mice. Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg/kg in the drinking water (0.5 times the maximum recommended daily human dosage or MRHD) for approximately two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose. This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans.</p><p>No evidence of carcinogenicity was noted in a rat 2-year carcinogenicity study testing oral doses of up to 30 mg/kg in the drinking water (1 times the MRHD). In a second rat study, no evidence of carcinogenicity was noted in rats at oral doses up to 75 mg/kg/day for males and 100 mg/kg/day for females (approximately 2 fold the maximum recommended human daily dose MRHD) for two years. However, the excessive decrease in body weight gain observed in the rat study might have reduced their sensitivity to any potential carcinogenic effect of the drug. No carcinogenic effect of tramadol was observed in p53(+/–)-heterozygous mice at oral doses up to 150 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Tramadol was mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay. Tramadol was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay using Salmonella and E. coli (Ames), the mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of metabolic activation, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, or the in vivo micronucleus assay in bone marrow.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg/kg in male rats and 75 mg/kg in female rats. These dosages are 1.2 and 1.8 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area, respectively.</p><h2>14 CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules are bioequivalent under fasting conditions to another extended-release tramadol product <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span> which demonstrated efficacy in two of four clinical trials of patients with chronic pain.<span class="Bold"> </span>To qualify for inclusion into these studies, patients were required to have moderate to moderately severe pain as defined by a pain intensity score of ≥40 mm, off previous medications, on a 0 – 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS).</span></p><p>In one 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with moderate to moderately severe pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee and/or hip were administered doses from 100 mg to 400 mg daily. Treatment with the extended-release tramadol product was initiated at 100 mg once daily for four days then increased by 100 mg per day increments every five days to the randomized fixed dose. Between 51% and 59% of patients in active treatment groups completed the study and 56% of patients in the placebo group completed the study. Discontinuations due to adverse events were more common in the extended-release tramadol product 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg treatment groups (20%, 27%, and 30% of discontinuations, respectively) compared to 14% of the patients treated with the extended-release tramadol product 100 mg and 10% of patients treated with placebo.</p><p>Pain, as assessed by the WOMAC Pain subscale, was measured at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks and change from baseline assessed. A responder analysis based on the percent change in WOMAC Pain subscale demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain for the 100 mg and 200 mg treatment groups compared to placebo (see Figure 2).</p><p>Figure 2</p><p></p><p>In one 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled flexible-dosing trial of the extended-release tramadol product in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, patients titrated to an average daily dose of approximately 270 mg/day. Forty-nine percent of patients randomized to the active treatment group completed the study, while 52% of patients randomized to placebo completed the study. Most of the early discontinuations in the active treatment group were due to adverse events, accounting for 27% of the early discontinuations in contrast to 7% of the discontinuations from the placebo group. Thirty-seven percent of the placebo-treated patients discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy compared to 15% of active-treated patients. The active treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and a statistically significant difference in the responder rate, based on the percent change from baseline in the VAS score, measured at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, between patients receiving the extended-release tramadol product and placebo (see Figure 3).</p><p>Figure 3</p><p></p><p>Four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules were conducted, none of which demonstrated efficacy but which differed in design from the preceding clinical studies described. Two trials were 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trials of Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, and 300 mg/day versus placebo in patients with moderate to moderately severe osteoarthritis pain of the hip and knee. The other two 12 week trials were similar in design, but only studied Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules 300 mg/day. In this fixed-dose design, subjects were required to titrate to a fixed dose, even if their pain responded to a lower titration dose.</p><h2>16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tramadol Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules (tramadol hydrochloride) capsules are supplied as opaque white hard gelatin capsules, imprinted as follows.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">1</span><span class="Bold">5</span><span class="Bold">0 mg Capsules:</span>       White capsule imprinted with gold ink “G <span class="Bold">322</span>” on cap and “<span class="Bold">150</span>” between lines on the body</span></p><p>Bottle of 500 capsules: NDC 69420-5150-01</p><p>Dispense in a tight container.
