</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Raxibacumab Injection</h2><h3>Inhalational Anthrax</h3><p class="First">Raxibacumab is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with inhalational anthrax due to <span class="Italics">Bacillus anthracis</span> in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. Raxibacumab is also indicated for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of raxibacumab is based solely on efficacy studies in animal models of inhalational anthrax. It is not ethical or feasible to conduct controlled clinical trials with intentional exposure of humans to anthrax. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.1).]</span></p><p>Safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of raxibacumab have been studied in adult healthy volunteers. There have been no trials of safety or PK of raxibacumab in the pediatric population. An extrapolation approach was used to derive dosing regimens that are predicted to provide pediatric patients with exposure comparable to the observed exposure in adults. <span class="Italics">[See Use in Specific Populations (8.4).]</span></p><p>Raxibacumab binds to the protective antigen (PA) of <span class="Italics">B.</span> <span class="Italics">anthracis</span>; it does not have direct antibacterial activity. Raxibacumab does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not prevent or treat meningitis. Raxibacumab should be used in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs.</p><h2>Raxibacumab Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dose and Schedule for Adults</h3><p class="First">Administer raxibacumab as a single dose of 40 mg/kg intravenously over 2 hours and 15 minutes after dilution in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) to a final volume of 250 mL. Administer 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine within 1 hour prior to raxibacumab infusion to reduce the risk of occurrence and/or the severity of an infusion reaction. Diphenhydramine route of administration (oral or intravenous) should be based on the temporal proximity to the start of raxibacumab infusion. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>, <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1).]</span></p><h3>Dose and Schedule for Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose for pediatric patients is based on weight as shown in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Greater than 40 kg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">40 mg/kg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Greater than 10 kg to 40 kg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">60 mg/kg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">10 kg or less</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">80 mg/kg</span></p><p>Premedicate with diphenhydramine within 1 hour prior to raxibacumab infusion to reduce the risk of occurrence and/or the severity of an infusion reaction.

No pediatric patients were studied during the development of raxibacumab. The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are derived from simulations designed to match the observed adult exposure to raxibacumab at a 40 mg/kg dose. <span class="Italics">[See Use in Specific Populations (8.4).]</span></p><h3>Preparation for Administration</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of raxibacumab is weight-based, given as an intravenous infusion after dilution in a compatible solution to a final volume of 250 mL (in adults) or to a volume indicated based on the child’s weight (Table 2). Dilute raxibacumab using one of the following compatible solutions:</p><p>Keep vials in their cartons prior to preparation of an infusion solution to protect raxibacumab from light.

The safety of raxibacumab has been studied only in healthy volunteers. It has not been studied in patients with inhalational anthrax.</p><p>The safety of raxibacumab has been evaluated in 326 healthy subjects treated with a dose of 40 mg/kg in 3 clinical trials: a drug interaction trial with ciprofloxacin (Study 1), a repeat-dose trial of 20 subjects with the second raxibacumab dose administered ≥4 months after the first dose (Study 2), and a placebo-controlled trial evaluating single doses with a subset of subjects receiving 2 raxibacumab doses 14 days apart (Study 3). Raxibacumab was administered to 86 healthy subjects in Study 1. In Study 3, 240 healthy subjects received raxibacumab (217 received 1 dose and 23 received 2 doses) and 80 subjects received placebo.</p><p>The overall safety of raxibacumab was evaluated as an integrated summary of these 3 clinical trials. Of 326 raxibacumab subjects, 283 received single doses, 23 received 2 doses 14 days apart, and 20 received 2 doses more than 4 months apart. The subjects were aged 18 to 88 years, 53% female, 74% white, 17% black/African-American, 6% Asian, and 15% Hispanic.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Raxibacumab Infusion</span></p><p>Four subjects (1.2%) had their infusion of raxibacumab discontinued for adverse reactions: 2 subjects (neither of whom received diphenhydramine premedication) due to urticaria (mild), and 1 subject each discontinued for clonus (mild) and dyspnea (moderate).</p><p><span class="Bold">Most Frequently Reported Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions were rash, pain in extremity, pruritus, and somnolence.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preferred Term</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n = 80 (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Single-Dose Raxibacumab</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n = 283 (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Double-Dose Raxibacumab</span></p><p><span class="Bold">≥4 Months Apart</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n = 20 (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Double-Dose Raxibacumab</span></p><p><span class="Bold">2 Weeks Apart</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n = 23 (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Total Raxibacumab Subjects</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 326 (%)</span></p><p class="First">Rash/Rash erythematous/Rash papular</p><p class="First">1 (1.3)</p><p class="First">9 (3.2)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">9 (2.8)</p><p class="First">Pain in extremity</p><p class="First">1 (1.3)</p><p class="First">7 (2.5)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">7 (2.1)</p><p class="First">Pruritus</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">7 (2.5)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">7 (2.1)</p><p class="First">Somnolence</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">4 (1.4)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">1 (4.3)</p><p class="First">5 (1.5)</p><p><span class="Bold">Rashes</span></p><p>For all subjects exposed to raxibacumab in clinical trials, the rate of rash was 2.8% (9/326) compared with 1.3% (1/80) of placebo subjects. Mild to moderate infusion-related rashes were reported in 22.2% (6/27) of subjects who did not receive diphenhydramine premedication compared with 3.3% (2/61) of subjects who were premedicated with diphenhydramine in the ciprofloxacin/raxibacumab combination trial (Study 1). In the placebo-controlled raxibacumab study where all subjects received diphenhydramine (Study 3), the rate of rash was 2.5% in both placebo- and raxibacumab-treated subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Less Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Clinically significant adverse reactions that were reported in &lt;1.5% of subjects exposed to raxibacumab and at rates higher than in placebo subjects are listed below:</p><p><span class="Bold">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>The development of anti-raxibacumab antibodies was evaluated in all subjects receiving single and double doses of raxibacumab in Studies 1, 2, and 3.

Additionally, the observed incidence of any antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to raxibacumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Ciprofloxacin</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of 40 mg/kg raxibacumab intravenously with intravenous or oral ciprofloxacin in human subjects did not alter the PK of either ciprofloxacin or raxibacumab <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the use of raxibacumab in pregnant women to inform on drug-associated risk. In pregnant rabbits, intravenous administration of raxibacumab was not associated with teratogenicity or other adverse developmental outcomes at 3 times the human maximum plasma concentrations at the maximum recommended adult dose <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk:</span> Limited data in the form of case reports of anthrax infection in pregnant women indicate that maternal infection is associated with a high risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal deaths, particularly in the absence of treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> A study was conducted in pregnant, healthy New Zealand White rabbits administered intravenous raxibacumab at dose levels of 40 or 120 mg/kg on Gestation Days 7 and 14. No teratogenicity or other adverse developmental outcomes were observed in pregnant rabbits at 3 times the human maximum plasma concentrations at the maximum recommended adult dose of 40 mg/kg. Maternal toxicity was observed at both doses (reduced body weight gain late in gestation, but no difference in mean total weight gain).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information available on the presence of raxibacumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for raxibacumab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from raxibacumab or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">As in adults, the effectiveness of raxibacumab in pediatric patients is based solely on efficacy studies in animal models of inhalational anthrax. As exposure of healthy children to raxibacumab is not ethical, an extrapolation approach was used to derive dosing regimens that are predicted to provide pediatric patients with exposure comparable to the observed exposure in adults receiving 40 mg/kg. The dose for pediatric patients is based on weight. <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.2).]</span></p><p>Safety or PK of raxibacumab have not been studied in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of raxibacumab did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of raxibacumab, 6.4% (21/326) were 65 years and older, while 1.5% (5/326) were 75 years and older. However, no alteration of dosing is needed for patients aged 65 years and older <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no clinical experience with overdosage of raxibacumab. In case of overdosage, monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects.</p><h2>Raxibacumab Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Raxibacumab is a human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody that binds the PA component of <span class="Italics">B. anthracis</span> toxin. Raxibacumab has a molecular weight of approximately 146 kilodaltons. Raxibacumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a murine cell expression system.</p><p>Raxibacumab is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow liquid formulation in single-use vials for intravenous infusion. Each vial contains 1,700 mg/34 mL (50 mg/mL) raxibacumab in citric acid (0.13 mg/mL), glycine (18 mg/mL), polysorbate 80 [0.2 mg/mL (w/v)], sodium citrate (2.8 mg/mL), sucrose (10 mg/mL), and Water for Injection, with a pH of 6.5.</p><h2>Raxibacumab Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds the PA of <span class="Italics">B. anthracis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The PK of raxibacumab is linear over the dose range of 1 to 40 mg/kg following single intravenous dosing in humans; raxibacumab was not tested at doses higher than 40 mg/kg in humans. Following single intravenous administration of raxibacumab 40 mg/kg in healthy, male and female human subjects, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> were 1,020.3 ± 140.6 mcg/mL and 15,845.8 ± 4,333.5 mcg•day/mL, respectively. Mean raxibacumab steady-state volume of distribution was greater than plasma volume, suggesting some tissue distribution. Clearance values were much smaller than the glomerular filtration rate indicating that there is virtually no renal clearance of raxibacumab.</p><p>Because the effectiveness of raxibacumab cannot be tested in humans, a comparison of raxibacumab exposures achieved in healthy human subjects to those observed in animal models of inhalational anthrax in therapeutic efficacy studies is necessary to support the dosage regimen of 40 mg/kg intravenously as a single dose for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in humans. Humans achieve similar or greater systemic exposure (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) to raxibacumab following a single 40 mg/kg intravenous dose compared with New Zealand White rabbits and cynomolgus macaques receiving the same dosage regimen.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects of Gender, Age, and Race</span></p><p>Raxibacumab PK was evaluated via a population PK analysis using serum samples from 322 healthy subjects who received a single 40 mg/kg intravenous dose across 3 clinical trials. Based on this analysis, gender (female versus male), race (non-white versus white), or age (elderly versus young) had no meaningful effects on the PK parameters for raxibacumab.</p><p>Raxibacumab PK has not been evaluated in children <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Repeat Dosing</span></p><p>Although raxibacumab is intended for single-dose administration, the PK of raxibacumab following a second administration of 40 mg/kg given intravenously 14 days after the first 40-mg/kg intravenous dose was assessed in 23 healthy subjects (Study 3). The mean raxibacumab concentration at 28 days after the second dose was approximately twice the mean raxibacumab concentration at 14 days following the first dose. In the human trial assessing the immunogenicity of raxibacumab (Study 2), 20 healthy subjects who had initially received a single dose of raxibacumab 40 mg/kg intravenously received a second 40 mg/kg intravenous dose at ≥4 months following their first dose. No statistically significant differences in mean estimates of AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>, CL, or half-life of raxibacumab between the 2 doses administered ≥4 months apart were observed. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> following the second dose was 15% lower than the C<span class="Sub">max</span> following the first dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Ciprofloxacin Interaction Trial</span></p><p>In an open-label trial evaluating the effect of raxibacumab on ciprofloxacin PK in healthy adult male and female subjects (Study 1), the administration of 40 mg/kg raxibacumab intravenously following ciprofloxacin intravenous infusion or ciprofloxacin oral tablet ingestion did not alter the PK of ciprofloxacin administered orally and/or intravenously. Likewise, ciprofloxacin did not alter the PK of raxibacumab. <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.1).]</span></p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds free PA with an affinity equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.78 ± 0.9 nM. Raxibacumab inhibits the binding of PA to its cellular receptors, preventing the intracellular entry of the anthrax lethal factor and edema factor, the enzymatic toxin components responsible for the pathogenic effects of anthrax toxin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Activity In Vitro and In Vivo</span></p><p>Raxibacumab binds in vitro to PA from the Ames, Vollum, and Sterne strains of <span class="Italics">B.</span> <span class="Italics">anthracis</span>. Raxibacumab binds to an epitope on PA that is conserved across reported strains of <span class="Italics">B.</span> <span class="Italics">anthracis.</span></p><p>In vivo studies in rats suggest that raxibacumab neutralizes the toxicity due to lethal toxin, as animals slowly infused with lethal toxin (a combination of PA + lethal factor) survived 7 days following administration. The median time to death in control rats was 16 hours. Similar observations were noted in animal efficacy studies in rabbits and monkeys challenged with <span class="Italics">B.</span> <span class="Italics">anthracis</span> spores by the inhalational route. PA was detected in animals following exposure to <span class="Italics">B.</span> <span class="Italics">anthracis</span> spores. PA levels rose and then fell to undetectable levels in animals that responded to treatment and survived, whereas levels continued to rise in animals that failed treatment and died or were euthanized because of poor clinical condition. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.1).]</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and fertility studies have not been conducted with raxibacumab.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology</h3><p class="First">Healthy cynomolgus macaques administered 3 intravenous doses or 3 subcutaneous doses of 40 mg/kg raxibacumab once every 12 days, or a single intramuscular dose (40 mg/kg) of raxibacumab, showed no adverse effects, including no effects up to 120 days post-dosing.</p><p>Studies with raxibacumab in rabbit, cynomolgus macaque, and human donor tissues showed no cross reactivity with brain.</p><p>Anthrax-infected rabbits and monkeys administered an intravenous injection of raxibacumab (40 mg/kg) at time of PA toxemia reproducibly showed greater severity of central nervous system (CNS) lesions (bacteria, inflammation, hemorrhage, and necrosis) in non-surviving animals compared with dead placebo-control animals, with no difference in mean time to death from spore challenge. The raxibacumab monoclonal antibody appears unable to penetrate the CNS until compromise of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during the later stages of anthrax infection. The most severe brain lesions in rabbits were associated with bacteria and raxibacumab tissue binding in a similar pattern as endogenous IgG antibody that leaked across the compromised BBB. No dose/exposure-response relationship for brain histopathology was identified. Surviving rabbits and monkeys at the end of the 28-day studies showed no microscopic evidence of CNS lesions. CNS toxicity was not observed in healthy monkeys administered raxibacumab (40 mg/kg) or in GLP combination treatment studies with antibacterials in rabbits (levofloxacin) or in monkeys (ciprofloxacin) at any time.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Because it is not feasible or ethical to conduct controlled clinical trials in humans with inhalational anthrax, the effectiveness of raxibacumab for therapeutic treatment of inhalational anthrax is based on efficacy studies in rabbits and monkeys. Raxibacumab effectiveness has not been studied in humans. Because the animal efficacy studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, the survival rates observed in the animal studies cannot be directly compared between studies and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The efficacy of raxibacumab for treatment of inhalational anthrax was studied in a monkey model (Study 2) and a rabbit model (Studies 3 and 4) of inhalational anthrax disease. These 3 studies tested raxibacumab efficacy compared with placebo. Another study in a rabbit model (Study 1) evaluated the efficacy of raxibacumab in combination with an antibacterial drug relative to the antibacterial drug alone. Studies were randomized and blinded.</p><p>The animals were challenged with aerosolized <span class="Italics">B.</span> <span class="Italics">anthracis</span> spores (Ames strain) at 200 x LD<span class="Sub">50</span> to achieve 100% mortality if untreated. In rabbit Study 1, treatment was delayed until 84 hours after spore challenge. In monkey Study 2, study treatment commenced at the time of a positive serum electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay for <span class="Italics">B.</span> <span class="Italics">anthracis</span> PA. The mean time between spore challenge and initiation of study treatment was 42 hours. In rabbit Studies 3 and 4, sustained elevation of body temperature above baseline for 2 hours or a positive result on serum ECL assay for PA served as the trigger for initiation of study treatment. The mean time between spore challenge and initiation of study treatment was 28 hours post-exposure. Efficacy in all therapeutic studies in animals was determined based on survival at the end of the study. Most study animals (88% to 100%) were bacteremic and had a positive ECL assay for PA prior to treatment in all 4 studies.</p><h3>Treatment of Inhalational Anthrax in Combination with Antibacterial Drug</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of raxibacumab administered with levofloxacin as treatment of animals with systemic anthrax disease (84 hours after spore challenge) was evaluated in New Zealand White rabbits (Study 1). The dose of levofloxacin was chosen to yield a comparable exposure to that achieved by the recommended doses in humans. Levofloxacin and raxibacumab PK in this study were unaffected by product co-administration. Forty-two percent of challenged animals survived to treatment. Treatment with antibacterial drug plus raxibacumab resulted in 82% survival compared with 65% survival in rabbits treated with antibacterial drug alone, <span class="Italics">P</span> = 0.0874 (Table 4).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NZW Rabbits (35 days)<span class="Sup">a</span></span><br/>

Treatment with raxibacumab alone resulted in a statistically significant dose-dependent improvement in survival relative to placebo when administered at the time of initial manifestations of anthrax disease in the rabbit and monkey infection models (Table 5). Raxibacumab at 40-mg/kg intravenous single dose was superior to placebo in the rabbit and monkey studies in the all treated and the bacteremic animal analysis populations. All surviving animals developed toxin-neutralizing antibodies.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study Drug</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Number (%) Survivors</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">P</span> Value<span class="Sup">c</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">95% CI<span class="Sup">d</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Number (%) Survivors</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">P</span> Value<span class="Sup">c</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">95% CI<span class="Sup">d</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Number (%) Survivors</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">P</span> Value<span class="Sup">c</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">95% CI<span class="Sup">d</span></span></p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p class="First">0/12</p><p class="First">0/17</p><p class="First">0/24</p><p class="First">20 mg/kg raxibacumab</p><p class="First">7/14 (50%)</p><p class="First">0.0064</p><p class="First">(19.3, 73.7)</p><p class="First">5/18 (28%)</p><p class="First">0.0455</p><p class="First">(6.6, 52.5)</p><p class="First">-</p><p class="First">-</p><p class="First">-</p><p class="First">40 mg/kg raxibacumab</p><p class="First">9/14 (64%)</p><p class="First">0.0007</p><p class="First">(31.6, 84.7)</p><p class="First">8/18 (44%)</p><p class="First">0.0029</p><p class="First">(21.3, 66.7)</p><p class="First">11/24 (46%)</p><p class="First">0.0002</p><p class="First">(27.0, 66.1)</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> Survival measured at 28 days after spore challenge.</p><p><span class="Sup">b</span> Survival measured at 14 days after spore challenge.</p><p><span class="Sup">c</span> P value based on two-sided Fisher's exact test for comparisons between raxibacumab and placebo.</p><p><span class="Sup">d</span> 95% CIs are exact confidence intervals for the difference between raxibacumab and placebo.</p><p>In other animal studies evaluating antibacterial drug alone and raxibacumab-antibacterial drug combination, the efficacy of an antibacterial drug alone (levofloxacin in rabbits and ciprofloxacin in monkeys) was very high (95% to 100%) when given at the initial manifestations of inhalational anthrax disease.
