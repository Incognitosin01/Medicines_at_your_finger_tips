</ul><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Complex sleep behaviors including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake may occur following use of Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets. Some of these events may result in serious injuries, including death. Discontinue Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Zolpidem Extended Release</h2><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance (as measured by wake time after sleep onset).</p><p>The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy were up to 3 weeks (using polysomnography measurement up to 2 weeks in both adult and elderly patients) and 24 weeks (using patient-reported assessment in adult patients only) in duration <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h2>Zolpidem Extended Release Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage in Adults</h3><p class="First">Use the lowest effective dose for the patient. The recommended initial dose is 6.25 mg for women and either 6.25 or 12.5 mg for men, taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7-8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 6.25 mg dose is not effective, the dose can be increased to 12.5 mg. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels following use of the 12.5 mg dose increase the risk of next-day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span> The total dose of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets should not exceed 12.5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets should be taken as a single dose and should not be readministered during the same night.</p><p>The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because zolpidem clearance is lower in women.</p><h3>Special Populations</h3><p class="First">Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of zolpidem tartrate. The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in these patients is 6.25 mg once daily immediately before bedtime <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><p>Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment do not clear the drug as rapidly as normal subjects. The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in these patients is 6.25 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Avoid Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Use with CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Dosage adjustment may be necessary when zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are combined with other CNS-depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole, and not be divided, crushed, or chewed. The effect of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets may be slowed by ingestion with or immediately after a meal.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, USP are available as extended-release tablets containing 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg of zolpidem tartrate for oral administration. Tablets are not scored.</p><p>Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, USP 6.25 mg are pink, round, coated tablet debossed with "T" on one side and plain on other side.</p><p>Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, USP 12.5 mg are blue, round, coated tablets debossed with "Z" on one side and plain on other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="following_xmChange">who have experienced complex sleep behaviors after taking zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></li>
<li>with known hypersensitivity to zolpidem. Observed reactions include anaphylaxis and angioedema <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Complex Sleep Behaviors</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake, may occur following the first or any subsequent use of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets. Patients can be seriously injured or injure others during complex sleep behaviors. Such injuries may result in a fatal outcome. Other complex sleep behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have also been reported. Patients usually do not remember these events. Postmarketing reports have shown that complex sleep behaviors may occur with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets alone at recommended doses, with or without the concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span> Discontinue Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></span></p><h3>CNS-Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment</h3><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are a CNS depressant and can impair daytime function in some patients even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for excess depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of subjective symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e. less than formal psychomotor testing). While pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets may develop, patients using zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets should be cautioned against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness the day after use.</p><p>Additive effects occur with concomitant use of other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol), including daytime use <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span> Downward dose adjustment of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets and concomitant CNS depressants should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span></p><p>The use of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets with other sedative-hypnotics (including other zolpidem products) at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended.</p><p>The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment is increased if zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining (7 to 8 hours); if higher than the recommended dose is taken; if coadministered with other CNS depressants or alcohol; or coadministered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of zolpidem. Patients should be warned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are taken in these circumstances <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2), Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><p>Vehicle drivers and machine operators should be warned that, as with other hypnotics, there may be a possible risk of adverse reactions including drowsiness, prolonged reaction time, dizziness, sleepiness, blurred/double vision, reduced alertness, and impaired driving the morning after therapy. In order to minimize this risk a full night of sleep (7–8 hours) is recommended.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Because zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls.</span></p><h3>Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses</h3><p class="First">Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including zolpidem.</p><h3>Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions</h3><p class="First">Cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the throat, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug.</p><h3>Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes</h3><p class="First">Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative/hypnotics, including zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets. Some of these changes included decreased inhibition (e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), bizarre behavior, agitation and depersonalization. Visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported.</p><p>In controlled trials, &lt;1% of adults with insomnia reported hallucinations. In a clinical trial, 7% of pediatric patients treated with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 0.25 mg/kg taken at bedtime reported hallucinations versus 0% treated with placebo <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p>It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Depression</h3><p class="First">In primarily depressed patients treated with sedative-hypnotics, worsening of depression, and suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), have been reported. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdosage is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time.</p><h3>Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Although studies with 10 mg zolpidem tartrate did not reveal respiratory depressant effects at hypnotic doses in healthy subjects or in patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a reduction in the Total Arousal Index, together with a reduction in lowest oxygen saturation and increase in the times of oxygen desaturation below 80% and 90%, was observed in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea when treated with zolpidem compared to placebo. Since sedative-hypnotics have the capacity to depress respiratory drive, precautions should be taken if zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function. Postmarketing reports of respiratory insufficiency in patients receiving 10 mg of zolpidem tartrate, most of whom had pre-existing respiratory impairment, have been reported. The risk of respiratory depression should be considered prior to prescribing zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in patients with respiratory impairment including sleep apnea and myasthenia gravis.</p><h3>Precipitation of Hepatic Encephalopathy</h3><p class="First">Drugs affecting GABA receptors, such as zolpidem tartrate, have been associated with precipitation of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with hepatic insufficiency. In addition, patients with hepatic insufficiency do not clear zolpidem tartrate as rapidly as patients with normal hepatic function. Avoid zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Withdrawal Effects</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of withdrawal signs and symptoms following the rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem. Monitor patients for tolerance, abuse, and dependence <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment</span></p><p>In 3-week clinical trials in adults and elderly patients (&gt;65 years), 3.5% (7/201) patients receiving zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction as compared to 0.9% (2/216) of patients on placebo. The reaction most commonly associated with discontinuation in patients treated with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets was somnolence (1%).</p><p>In a 6-month study in adult patients (18–64 years of age), 8.5% (57/669) of patients receiving zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, 12.5 mg as compared to 4.6% on placebo (16/349) discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets included anxiety (anxiety, restlessness or agitation) reported in 1.5% (10/669) of patients as compared to 0.3% (1/349) of patients on placebo, and depression (depression, major depression or depressed mood) reported in 1.5% (10/669) of patients as compared to 0.3% (1/349) of patients on placebo.</p><p>Data from a clinical study in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor- (SSRI-) treated patients were given zolpidem revealed that four of the seven discontinuations during double-blind treatment with zolpidem (n=95) were associated with impaired concentration, continuing or aggravated depression, and manic reaction; one patient treated with placebo (n =97) was discontinued after an attempted suicide.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Controlled Trials</span></p><p>During treatment with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in adults and elderly at daily doses of 12.5 mg and 6.25 mg, respectively, each for three weeks, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets were headache, next-day somnolence, and dizziness.</p><p>In the 6-month trial evaluating zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, 12.5 mg, the adverse reaction profile was consistent with that reported in short-term trials, except for a higher incidence of anxiety (6.3% for zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets versus 2.6% for placebo).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of ≥1% in Controlled Trials</span></p><p>The following tables enumerate treatment-emergent adverse reactions frequencies that were observed at an incidence equal to 1% or greater among patients with insomnia who received zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in placebo-controlled trials. Events reported by investigators were classified utilizing the MedDRA dictionary for the purpose of establishing event frequencies. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice, in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in these clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving related drug products and uses, since each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions. However, the cited figures provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population studied.</p><p>The following tables were derived from results of two placebo-controlled efficacy trials involving zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets These trials involved patients with primary insomnia who were treated for 3 weeks with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets at doses of 12.5 mg (Table 1) or 6.25 mg (Table 2), respectively. The tables include only adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 1% for zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets patients and with an incidence greater than that seen in the placebo patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose Relationship For Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>There is evidence from dose comparison trials suggesting a dose relationship for many of the adverse reactions associated with zolpidem use, particularly for certain CNS and gastrointestinal adverse events.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions Observed during the Premarketing Evaluation of Zolpidem Tartrate Extended-Release Tablets</span></p><p>Other treatment-emergent adverse reactions associated with participation in zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets studies (those reported at frequencies of &lt;1%) were not different in nature or frequency to those seen in studies with immediate-release zolpidem tartrate, which are listed below.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Events Observed during the Premarketing Evaluation of Immediate-Release Zolpidem Tartrate</span></p><p>Immediate-release zolpidem tartrate was administered to 3,660 subjects in clinical trials throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events, similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary of preferred terms.</p><p>The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportions of the 3,660 individuals exposed to zolpidem, at all doses, who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving zolpidem. All reported treatment-emergent adverse events are included, except those already listed in the table above of adverse events in placebo-controlled studies, those coding terms that are so general as to be uninformative, and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported did occur during treatment with zolpidem tartrate tablets, they were not necessarily caused by it.</p><p>Adverse events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in greater than 1/100 subjects; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Autonomic nervous system:</span> Frequent: dry mouth.

There are reports of excess sedation in infants exposed to zolpidem through breastmilk <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>. There is no information on the effects of zolpidem on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Infants exposed to zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets through breastmilk should be monitored for excess sedation, hypotonia, and respiratory depression. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 23 hours (approximately 5 elimination half-lives) after zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets administration in order to minimize drug exposure to a breast fed infant.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in children. Safety and effectiveness of zolpidem in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.</p><p>In an 8-week study in pediatric patients (aged 6–17 years) with insomnia associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) an oral solution of zolpidem tartrate dosed at 0.25 mg/kg at bedtime did not decrease sleep latency compared to placebo. Psychiatric and nervous system disorders comprised the most frequent (&gt;5%) treatment emergent adverse reactions observed with zolpidem versus placebo and included dizziness (23.5% vs 1.5%), headache (12.5% vs 9.2%), and hallucinations were reported in 7% of the pediatric patients who received zolpidem; none of the pediatric patients who received placebo reported hallucinations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span> Ten patients on zolpidem (7.4%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction.</p><p>FDA has not required pediatric studies of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in the pediatric population based on these efficacy and safety findings.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">A total of 99 elderly (≥65 years of age) received daily doses of 6.25 mg zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in a 3-week placebo-controlled study. The adverse reaction profile of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg in this population was similar to that of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg in younger adults (≤64 years of age). Dizziness was reported in 8% of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets-treated patients compared with 3% of those treated with placebo.</p><p>The dose of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in elderly patients is 6.25 mg to minimize adverse effects related to impaired motor and/or cognitive performance and unusual sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Gender Difference in Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Women clear zolpidem tartrate from the body at a lower rate than men. C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC parameters of zolpidem from zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets were, respectively, approximately 50% and 75% higher at the same dose in adult female subjects compared to adult male subjects. Between 6 and 12 hours after dosing, zolpidem concentrations were 2 to 3 fold higher in adult female compared to adult male subjects. Given the higher blood levels of zolpidem tartrate in women compared to men at a given dose, the recommended initial dose of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets for adult women is 6.25 mg, and the recommended dose for adult men is 6.25 or 12.5 mg.</p><p>In geriatric patients, clearance of zolpidem is similar in men and women. The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in geriatric patients is 6.25 mg regardless of gender.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment is 6.25 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Avoid zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by federal regulation.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations. It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, using a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</p><p>Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of zolpidem tartrate 40 mg were similar, but not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while zolpidem tartrate 10 mg effects were difficult to distinguish from placebo.</p><p>Because persons with a history of addiction to, or abuse of, drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse, abuse and addiction of zolpidem, they should be monitored carefully when receiving zolpidem or any other hypnotic.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.</p><p>Sedative/hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation. These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, and convulsions. The following adverse events, which are considered to meet the DSM-III-R criteria for uncomplicated sedative/hypnotic withdrawal, were reported during U.S. clinical trials following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last zolpidem treatment: fatigue, nausea, flushing, lightheadedness, uncontrolled crying, emesis, stomach cramps, panic attack, nervousness, and abdominal discomfort. These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or less. However, available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence, if any, of dependence during treatment at recommended doses. Postmarketing reports of abuse, dependence and withdrawal have been received.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">In postmarketing experience of overdose with zolpidem tartrate alone, or in combination with CNS-depressant agents, impairment of consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma, cardiovascular and/or respiratory compromise, and fatal outcomes have been reported.</p><h3>Recommended Treatment</h3><p class="First">General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. Zolpidem's sedative hypnotic effect was shown to be reduced by flumazenil and therefore may be useful; however, flumazenil administration may contribute to the appearance of neurological symptoms (convulsions). As in all cases of drug overdose, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. Hypotension and CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention. Sedating drugs should be withheld following zolpidem overdosage, even if excitation occurs. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined, although hemodialysis studies in patients with renal failure receiving therapeutic doses have demonstrated that zolpidem is not dialyzable.</p><p>As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage.</p><h2>Zolpidem Extended Release Description</h2><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, USP contain zolpidem tartrate, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor positive modulator of the imidazopyridine class. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, USP are available in 6.25 mg and 12.5 mg strength tablets for oral administration.</p><p>Chemically, zolpidem is N,N,6-trimethyl-2-p-tolylimidazo[1,2-a] pyridine-3-acetamide L-(+)-tartrate (2:1). It has the following structure:</p><p>Zolpidem tartrate is a white to off-white crystalline powder that is sparingly soluble in water, alcohol, and propylene glycol. It has a molecular weight of 764.88.</p><p>Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets consist of a coated two-layer tablet: one layer that releases its drug content immediately and another layer that allows a slower release of additional drug content. The 6.25 mg zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, ferric oxide yellow, magnesium stearate, potassium bitartrate, hypromellose, colloidal silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, FD&amp;C Red #40. The 12.5 mg zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, ferric oxide red, magnesium stearate, potassium bitartrate, hypromellose, colloidal silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, FD&amp;C Blue #2.</p><p>Meets USP Dissolution Test 2.</p><h2>Zolpidem Extended Release - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Zolpidem is a GABA A receptor positive modulator presumed to exert its therapeutic effects in the short-term treatment of insomnia through binding to the benzodiazepine site of α1 subunit containing GABA A receptors, increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening resulting in the inhibition of neuronal excitation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Zolpidem binds to GABA A receptors with greater affinity for α1 subunit relative to α2 and α3 subunit containing receptors. Zolpidem has no appreciable binding affinity for α5 subunit containing GABA A receptors. This binding profile may explain the relative absence of myorelaxant effects in animal studies. Zolpidem has no appreciable binding affinity for dopaminergic D2, serotonergic 5HT<span class="Sub">2</span>, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets exhibit biphasic absorption characteristics, which results in rapid initial absorption from the gastrointestinal tract similar to zolpidem tartrate immediate-release, then provides extended plasma concentrations beyond three hours after administration. A study in 24 healthy male subjects was conducted to compare mean zolpidem plasma concentration-time profiles obtained after single oral administration of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg and of an immediate-release formulation of zolpidem tartrate (10 mg). The terminal elimination half-life observed with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets (12.5 mg) was similar to that obtained with immediate-release zolpidem tartrate (10 mg). The mean plasma concentration-time profiles are shown in Figure 1.</p><p>In adult and elderly patients treated with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, there was no evidence of accumulation after repeated once-daily dosing for up to two weeks.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following administration of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, administered as a single 12.5 mg dose in healthy male adult subjects, the mean peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of zolpidem was 134 ng/mL (range: 68.9 to 197 ng/ml) occurring at a median time (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) of 1.5 hours. The mean AUC of zolpidem was 740 ng∙hr/mL (range: 295 to 1359 ng∙hr/mL).</p><p>A food-effect study in 45 healthy subjects compared the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg when administered while fasting or within 30 minutes after a meal.
