</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film</h2><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should be used as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support.</p><h2>Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Drug Addiction and Treatment Act</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to healthcare providers who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription.</span></p><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Information</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is administered sublingually or buccally as a single daily dose.</p><p>Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits.</p><h3>Induction</h3><p class="First">Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.</p><p class="First">Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products may be inducted with either Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film or with sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy. At treatment initiation, the first dose of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should be administered when objective signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, not less than six hours after the patient last used opioids.</p><p>It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, be achieved as rapidly as possible. In some studies, a too-gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of drop-out of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.</p><p>On Day 1, an induction dosage of up to 8 mg/2 mg Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is recommended. Clinicians should start with an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg buprenorphine and naloxone and may titrate upwards in 2 or 4 mg increments of buprenorphine, at approximately 2-hour intervals, under supervision, to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine and naloxone based on the control of acute withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>On Day 2, a single daily dose of up to 16 mg/4 mg Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is recommended.</p><p>Because the exposure to naloxone is somewhat higher after buccal than after sublingual administration, it is recommended that the sublingual site of administration be used during induction to minimize exposure to naloxone, to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.</p><p class="First">Patients dependent upon methadone or long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products.</p><p>Buprenorphine and naloxone combination products have not been evaluated in adequate and well-controlled studies for induction in patients who are physically dependent on long-acting opioid products, and the naloxone in these combination products is absorbed in small amounts by the sublingual route and could cause worse precipitated and prolonged withdrawal. For this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended in patients taking long-acting opioids when used according to approved administration instructions. Following induction, the patient may then be transitioned to once-daily Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film.</p><h3>Maintenance</h3><h3>Method of Administration</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film. Advise patients not to eat or drink anything until the film is completely dissolved.</p><p class="First">Place one film under the tongue, close to the base on the left or right side. If an additional film is necessary to achieve the prescribed dose, place an additional film sublingually on the opposite side from the first film. Place the film in a manner to minimize overlapping as much as possible. The film must be kept under the tongue until the film is completely dissolved. If a third film is necessary to achieve the prescribed dose, place it under the tongue on either side after the first 2 films have dissolved.</p><p class="First">Place one film on the inside of the right or left cheek. If an additional film is necessary to achieve the prescribed dose, place an additional film on the inside of the opposite cheek. The film must be kept on the inside of the cheek until the film is completely dissolved. If a third film is necessary to achieve the prescribed dose, place it on the inside of the right or left cheek after the first two films have dissolved.</p><p>Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should NOT be moved after placement.</p><p>To ensure consistency in bioavailability, patients should follow the same manner of dosing with continued use of the product. Proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient.</p><h3>Clinical Supervision</h3><p class="First">Treatment should be initiated with supervised administration, progressing to unsupervised administration as the patient’s clinical stability permits. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is subject to diversion and abuse. When determining the prescription quantity for unsupervised administration, consider the patient’s level of stability, the security of his or her home situation, and other factors likely to affect the ability to manage supplies of take-home medication.</p><p>Ideally patients should be seen at reasonable intervals (e.g., at least weekly during the first month of treatment) based upon the individual circumstances of the patient. Medication should be prescribed in consideration of the frequency of visits. Provision of multiple refills is not advised early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. Periodic assessment is necessary to determine compliance with the dosing regimen, effectiveness of the treatment plan, and overall patient progress.</p><p>Once a stable dosage has been achieved and patient assessment (e.g., urine drug screening) does not indicate illicit drug use, less frequent follow-up visits may be appropriate. A once-monthly visit schedule may be reasonable for patients on a stable dosage of medication who are making progress toward their treatment objectives. Continuation or modification of pharmacotherapy should be based on the healthcare provider’s evaluation of treatment outcomes and objectives such as:</p><p>If treatment goals are not being achieved, the healthcare provider should re-evaluate the appropriateness of continuing the current treatment.</p><h3>Unstable Patients</h3><p class="First">Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment.</p><p>Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.</p><h3>Discontinuing Treatment</h3><p class="First">The decision to discontinue therapy with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment. Taper patients to reduce the occurrence of opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Switching Between Buprenorphine or Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film</h3><p class="First">Patients being switched between buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine only sublingual tablets and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should be started on the same dosage of the previously administered product. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between buprenorphine products. Not all strengths and combinations of the Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Films are bioequivalent to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets as observed in pharmacokinetic studies <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Therefore, systemic exposures of buprenorphine and naloxone may be different when patients are switched from tablets to film or vice-versa. Patients should be monitored for symptoms related to over-dosing or under-dosing.</p><h3>Switching Between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film Strengths</h3><p class="First">As indicated in Table 1, the sizes and the compositions of the two units of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Films, i.e., 2 mg/0.5 mg and the 4 mg/1 mg units, are different from one another. If patients switch between various combinations of lower and higher strength units of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Films to obtain the same total dose, (e.g., from three 4 mg/1 mg units to a single 12 mg/3 mg unit, or vice-versa), systemic exposures of buprenorphine and naloxone may be different and patients should be monitored for over-dosing or under-dosing. For this reason, pharmacist should not substitute one or more film strengths for another without approval of the prescriber.</p><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film unit strength</p><p>(buprenorphine/naloxone)</p><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film unit dimensions</p><p class="First">Buprenorphine Concentration</p><p>% (w/w)</p><p class="First">Naloxone Concentration</p><p>% (w/w)</p><p class="First">2 mg/0.5 mg</p><p class="First">22.0 mm x 12.8 mm</p><p class="First">5.40</p><p class="First">1.53</p><p class="First">4 mg/1 mg</p><p>(2 times the length of the 2 mg/0.5 mg unit)</p><p class="First">22.0 mm x 25.6 mm</p><p class="First">5.40</p><p class="First">1.53</p><h3>Switching Between Sublingual and Buccal Sites of Administration</h3><p class="First">The systemic exposure of buprenorphine between buccal and sublingual administration of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is similar. Therefore, once induction is complete, patients can switch between buccal and sublingual administration without significant risk of under or overdosing.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film are available in child resistant polyester/foil laminated pouches containing 2.16 mg or 4.31 mg of buprenorphine HCl, USP equivalent to 2 mg or 4 mg of buprenorphine free base, respectively, and 0.61 mg or 1.22 mg of naloxone HCl, USP dihydrate equivalent to 0.5 mg or 1 mg of naloxone free base, respectively, providing for the following combinations: 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film contains buprenorphine, a schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient’s level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Life-Threatening Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Use Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Managing Risks from Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.</p><p>As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.</p><p>Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.</p><p>Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.</p><p>For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient’s buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.</p><p>In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Unintentional Pediatric Exposure</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine-containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>. When discontinuing Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film, gradually taper the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events</h3><p class="First">Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment, are recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film.</p><h3>Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Because it contains naloxone, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is likely to produce withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided.</p><h3>Risk of Overdose in Opioid Naïve Patients</h3><p class="First">There have been reported deaths of opioid-naïve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is not appropriate as an analgesic.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine and naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine’s efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine and naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine and naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. However, patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine’s efficacy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Caution patients about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Like other opioids, Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.</p><h3>Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.</p><h3>Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.</p><h3>Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions</h3><p class="First">As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</span></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is supported by clinical trials using buprenorphine sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions, as well as an open-label study in 194 patients treated with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film administered sublingually and 188 patients treated with the film administered buccally. In total, safety data from clinical studies are available from over 3000 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in the treatment of opioid dependence. Few differences in the adverse event profile were noted with regard to sublingually and buccally administered Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, buprenorphine sublingual tablets and a buprenorphine ethanolic sublingual solution.</p><p>The most common adverse event (&gt; 1%) associated with the sublingual administration of the Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film was oral hypoesthesia. Other adverse events were constipation, glossodynia, oral mucosal erythema, vomiting, intoxication, disturbance in attention, palpitations, insomnia, withdrawal syndrome, hyperhidrosis, and blurred vision.</p><p>The most common adverse events associated with the buccal administration were similar to those observed with sublingual administration of the film.</p><p>Other adverse event data were derived from larger, controlled studies of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine sublingual tablets and of buprenorphine sublingual solution. In a comparative study of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine sublingual tablets, adverse event profiles were similar for subjects treated with 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets or 16 mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets. The following adverse events were reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4 week study of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine sublingual tablets.</p><p class="First">Body System/ Adverse Event (COSTART Terminology)</p><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets</p><p>16 mg/4 mg/day</p><p>N = 107</p><p>n (%)</p><p class="First">Buprenorphine Sublingual Tablets</p><p>16 mg/day</p><p>N = 103</p><p>n (%)</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p>N = 107</p><p>n (%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Body as a Whole</span></p><p class="First">Asthenia</p><p class="First">7 (6.5%)</p><p class="First">5 (4.9%)</p><p class="First">7 (6.5%)</p><p class="First">Chills</p><p class="First">8 (7.5%)</p><p class="First">8 (7.8%)</p><p class="First">8 (7.5%)</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">39 (36.4%)</p><p class="First">30 (29.1%)</p><p class="First">24 (22.4%)</p><p class="First">Infection</p><p class="First">6 (5.6%)</p><p class="First">12 (11.7%)</p><p class="First">7 (6.5%)</p><p class="First">Pain</p><p class="First">24 (22.4%)</p><p class="First">19 (18.4%)</p><p class="First">20 (18.7%)</p><p class="First">Pain abdomen</p><p class="First">12 (11.2%)</p><p class="First">12 (11.7%)</p><p class="First">7 (6.5%)</p><p class="First">Pain back</p><p class="First">4 (3.7%)</p><p class="First">8 (7.8%)</p><p class="First">12 (11.2%)</p><p class="First">Withdrawal syndrome</p><p class="First">27 (25.2%)</p><p class="First">19 (18.4%)</p><p class="First">40 (37.4%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular System</span></p><p class="First">Vasodilation</p><p class="First">10 (9.3%)</p><p class="First">4 (3.9%)</p><p class="First">7 (6.5%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Digestive System</span></p><p class="First">Constipation</p><p class="First">13 (12.1%)</p><p class="First">8 (7.8%)</p><p class="First">3 (2.8%)</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">4 (3.7%)</p><p class="First">5 (4.9%)</p><p class="First">16 (15.0%)</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">16 (15.0%)</p><p class="First">14 (13.6%)</p><p class="First">12 (11.2%)</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">8 (7.5%)</p><p class="First">8 (7.8%)</p><p class="First">5 (4.7%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nervous System</span></p><p class="First">Insomnia</p><p class="First">15 (14.0%)</p><p class="First">22 (21.4%)</p><p class="First">17 (15.9%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Respiratory System</span></p><p class="First">Rhinitis</p><p class="First">5 (4.7%)</p><p class="First">10 (9.7%)</p><p class="First">14 (13.1%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin And Appendages</span></p><p class="First">Sweating</p><p class="First">15 (14.0%)</p><p class="First">13 (12.6%)</p><p class="First">11 (10.3%)</p><p>The adverse event profile of buprenorphine was also characterized in the dose-controlled study of a buprenorphine ethanolic solution, over a range of doses in four months of treatment.

There are limited data from randomized clinical trials in women maintained on buprenorphine that were not designed appropriately to assess the risk of major malformations <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Observational studies have reported on congenital malformations among buprenorphine-exposed pregnancies, but were also not designed appropriately to assess the risk of congenital malformations specifically due to buprenorphine exposure <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. The extremely limited data on sublingual naloxone exposure in pregnancy are not sufficient to evaluate a drug-associated risk.</p><p>Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and rabbits identified adverse events at clinically relevant and higher doses. Embryofetal death was observed in both rats and rabbits administered buprenorphine during the period of organogenesis at doses approximately 6 and 0.3 times, respectively, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg/day of buprenorphine. Pre- and postnatal development studies in rats demonstrated increased neonatal deaths at 0.3 times and above and dystocia at approximately 3 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg/day of buprenorphine. No clear teratogenic effects were seen when buprenorphine was administered during organogenesis with a range of doses equivalent to or greater than the human sublingual dose of 16 mg/day of buprenorphine. However, increases in skeletal abnormalities were noted in rats and rabbits administered buprenorphine daily during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.6 and approximately equal to the human sublingual dose of 16 mg/day of buprenorphine, respectively. In a few studies, some events such as acephalus and omphalocele were also observed but these findings were not clearly treatment-related <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p class="First">Untreated opioid addiction in pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and fetal death. In addition, untreated opioid addiction often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use.</p><p class="First">Dosage adjustments of buprenorphine may be required during pregnancy, even if the patient was maintained on a stable dose prior to pregnancy. Withdrawal signs and symptoms should be monitored closely and the dose adjusted as necessary.</p><p class="First">Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may occur in newborn infants of mothers who are receiving treatment with Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film.</p><p>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or failure to gain weight. Signs of neonatal withdrawal usually occur in the first days after birth. The duration and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may vary. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><p class="First">Opioid-dependent women on buprenorphine maintenance therapy may require additional analgesia during labor.</p><p class="First">Studies have been conducted to evaluate neonatal outcomes in women exposed to buprenorphine during pregnancy. Limited data on malformations from trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports on buprenorphine use in pregnancy do not indicate an increased risk of major malformations specifically due to buprenorphine. Several factors may complicate the interpretation of investigations of the children of women who take buprenorphine during pregnancy, including maternal use of illicit drugs, late presentation for prenatal care, infection, poor compliance, poor nutrition, and psychosocial circumstances. Interpretation of data is complicated further by the lack of information on untreated opioid-dependent pregnant women, who would be the most appropriate group for comparison. Rather, women on another form of opioid medication-assisted treatment, or women in the general population are generally used as the comparison group. However, women in these comparison groups may be different from women prescribed buprenorphine-containing products with respect to maternal factors that may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial [Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research (MOTHER)] designed primarily to assess neonatal opioid withdrawal effects, opioid-dependent pregnant women were randomized to buprenorphine (n = 86) or methadone (n = 89) treatment, with enrollment at an average gestational age of 18.7 weeks in both groups. A total of 28 of the 86 women in the buprenorphine group (33%) and 16 of the 89 women in the methadone group (18%) discontinued treatment before the end of pregnancy.</p><p>Among women who remained in treatment until delivery, there was no difference between buprenorphine-treated and methadone-treated groups in the number of neonates requiring NOWS treatment or in the peak severity of NOWS. Buprenorphine-exposed neonates required less morphine (mean total dose, 1.1 mg vs. 10.4 mg), had shorter hospital stays (10.0 days vs. 17.5 days), and shorter duration of treatment for NOWS (4.1 days vs. 9.9 days) compared to the methadone-exposed group. There were no differences between groups in other primary outcomes (neonatal head circumference,) or secondary outcomes (weight and length at birth, preterm birth, gestational age at delivery, and 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores), or in the rates of maternal or neonatal adverse events. The outcomes among mothers who discontinued treatment before delivery and may have relapsed to illicit opioid use are not known. Because of the imbalance in discontinuation rates between the buprenorphine and methadone groups, the study findings are difficult to interpret.</p><p class="First">The exposure margins listed below are based on body surface area comparisons (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) to the human sublingual dose of 16 mg buprenorphine via buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets.</p><p>Effects on embryo-fetal development were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats and Russian white rabbits following oral (1:1) and intramuscular (IM) (3:2) administration of mixtures of buprenorphine and naloxone during the period of organogenesis. Following oral administration to rats no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 150 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) in the presence of maternal toxicity (mortality). Following oral administration to rabbits, no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 50 times, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) in the absence of clear maternal toxicity.</p><p>No definitive drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in rats and rabbits at IM doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure approximately 20 times and 35 times, respectively, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). Maternal toxicity resulting in mortality was noted in these studies in both rats and rabbits. Acephalus was observed in one rabbit fetus from the low-dose group and omphalocele was observed in two rabbit fetuses from the same litter in the mid-dose group; no findings were observed in fetuses from the high-dose group. Maternal toxicity was seen in the high-dose group but not at the lower doses where the findings were observed. Following oral administration of buprenorphine to rats, dose-related post-implantation losses, evidenced by increases in the numbers of early resorptions with consequent reductions in the numbers of fetuses, were observed at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 6 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). In the rabbit, increased post-implantation losses occurred at an oral dose of 40 mg/kg/day. Following IM administration in the rat and the rabbit, post-implantation losses, as evidenced by decreases in live fetuses and increases in resorptions, occurred at 30 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Buprenorphine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits after IM or subcutaneous (SC) doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 3 and 6 times, respectively, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), after IV doses up to 0.8 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 0.5 times and equal to, respectively, the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), or after oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day in rats (estimated exposure was approximately 95 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) and 25 mg/kg/day in rabbits (estimated exposure was approximately 30 times the human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg). Significant increases in skeletal abnormalities (e.g., extra thoracic vertebra or thoraco-lumbar ribs) were noted in rats after SC administration of 1 mg/kg/day and up (estimated exposure was approximately 0.6 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), but were not observed at oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day. Increases in skeletal abnormalities in rabbits after IM administration of 5 mg/kg/day (estimated exposure was approximately 6 times the human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg) in the absence of maternal toxicity or oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure was approximately equal to the human sublingual dose of 16 mg) were not statistically significant.</p><p>In rabbits, buprenorphine produced statistically significant pre-implantation losses at oral doses of 1 mg/kg/day or greater and post-implantation losses that were statistically significant at IV doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day or greater (estimated exposure approximately 0.3 times the human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg). No maternal toxicity was noted at doses causing post-implantation loss in this study.</p><p>Dystocia was noted in pregnant rats treated intramuscularly with buprenorphine from Gestation Day 14 through Lactation Day 21 at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). Fertility, pre- and post-natal development studies with buprenorphine in rats indicated increases in neonatal mortality after oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.5 times the human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg), after IM doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.3 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg), and after SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day and up (approximately 0.06 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg). An apparent lack of milk production during these studies likely contributed to the decreased pup viability and lactation indices. Delays in the occurrence of righting reflex and startle response were noted in rat pups at an oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 50 times the human sublingual dose of 16 mg).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">Based on two studies in 13 lactating women maintained on buprenorphine treatment, buprenorphine and its metabolite norbuprenorphine were present in low levels in human milk and infant urine. Available data have not shown adverse reactions in breastfed infants. There are no data on the combination product buprenorphine and naloxone in breastfeeding, however oral absorption of naloxone is limited. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First">Advise breastfeeding women taking buprenorphine products to monitor the infant for increased drowsiness and breathing difficulties.</p><p class="First">Data were consistent from two studies (N = 13) of breastfeeding infants whose mothers were maintained on sublingual doses of buprenorphine ranging from 2.4 to 24 mg/day, showing that the infants were exposed to less than 1% of the maternal daily dose.</p><p>In a study of six lactating women who were taking a median sublingual buprenorphine dose of 0.29 mg/kg/day 5 to 8 days after delivery, breast milk provided a median infant dose of 0.42 mcg/kg/day of buprenorphine and 0.33 mcg/kg/day of norbuprenorphine, equal to 0.2% and 0.12%, respectively, of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (relative dose/kg (%) of norbuprenorphine was calculated from the assumption that buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine are equipotent).</p><p>Data from a study of seven lactating women who were taking a median sublingual buprenorphine dose of 7 mg/day an average of 1.12 months after delivery indicated that the mean milk concentrations (C<span class="Sub">avg</span>) of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were 3.65 mcg/L and 1.94 mcg/L respectively. Based on the study data, and assuming milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated mean absolute infant dose (AID) of 0.55 mcg/kg/day of buprenorphine and 0.29 mcg/kg/day of norbuprenorphine, or a mean relative infant dose (RID) of 0.38% and 0.18%, respectively, of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film have not been established in pediatric patients. This product is not appropriate for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome in neonates, because it contains naloxone, an opioid antagonist.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, or buprenorphine sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Due to possible decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in geriatric patients, the decision to prescribe Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should be made cautiously in individuals 65 years of age or older and these patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone has been evaluated in a pharmacokinetic study. Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver. While no clinically significant changes have been observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment; the plasma levels have been shown to be higher and half-life values have been shown to be longer for both buprenorphine and naloxone in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The magnitude of the effects on naloxone are greater than that on buprenorphine in both moderately and severely impaired subjects. The difference in magnitude of the effects on naloxone and buprenorphine are greater in subjects with severe hepatic impairment than in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore the clinical impact of these effects is likely to be greater in patients with severe hepatic impairment than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.</p><p>Buprenorphine and naloxone products should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No differences in buprenorphine pharmacokinetics were observed between 9 dialysis-dependent and 6 normal patients following IV administration of 0.3 mg buprenorphine. The effects of renal failure on naloxone pharmacokinetics are unknown.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act.</p><p><span class="Bold">Under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) codified at 21 U.S.C. 823(g), prescription use of this product in the treatment of opioid dependence is limited to healthcare providers who meet certain qualifying requirements, and who have notified the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their intent to prescribe this product for the treatment of opioid dependence and have been assigned a unique identification number that must be included on every prescription.</span></p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine, like morphine and other opioids, has the potential for being abused and is subject to criminal diversion. This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine in situations when the clinician is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Healthcare professionals should contact their state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><p>Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with or referred for more intensive and structured treatment.</p><p>Abuse of buprenorphine poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with the abuse of buprenorphine and alcohol and other substances, especially benzodiazepines.</p><p>The healthcare provider may be able to more easily detect misuse or diversion by maintaining records of medication prescribed including date, dose, quantity, frequency of refills, and renewal requests of medication prescribed.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper handling and storage of the medication are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by moderate withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><p>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clinical Presentation:</span></span> The manifestations of acute overdose include pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, respiratory depression, and death.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Treatment of Overdose:</span></span> In the event of overdose, the respiratory and cardiac status of the patient should be monitored carefully. When respiratory or cardiac functions are depressed, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.</p><p>In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. The long duration of action of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film should be taken into consideration when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an overdose. Insufficient duration of monitoring may put patients at risk.</p><h2>Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film Description</h2><p class="First">Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film is an orange film, printed with white ink identifying the product and strength.

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. Naloxone is a potent antagonist at mu-opioid receptors and produces opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists when administered parenterally.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Comparisons of buprenorphine to full opioid agonists such as methadone and hydromorphone suggest that sublingual buprenorphine produces typical opioid agonist effects which are limited by a ceiling effect.</p><p>In opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent, acute sublingual doses of buprenorphine and naloxone tablets produced opioid agonist effects which reached a maximum between doses of 8 mg/2 mg and 16 mg/4 mg buprenorphine and naloxone.</p><p>Opioid agonist ceiling-effects were also observed in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg), placebo and a full agonist control at various doses. The treatments were given in ascending dose order at intervals of at least one week to 16 opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent. Both active drugs produced typical opioid agonist effects. For all measures for which the drugs produced an effect, buprenorphine produced a dose-related response. However, in each case, there was a dose that produced no further effect. In contrast, the highest dose of the full agonist control always produced the greatest effects. Agonist objective rating scores remained elevated for the higher doses of buprenorphine (8 mg to 32 mg) longer than for the lower doses and did not return to baseline until 48 hours after drug administration. The onset of effects appeared more rapidly with buprenorphine than with the full agonist control, with most doses nearing peak effect after 100 minutes for buprenorphine compared to 150 minutes for the full agonist control.</p><p class="First">Buprenorphine in IV (2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses has been administered to opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for treatment of opioid dependence. Compared to placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O<span class="Sub">2</span> saturation, or skin temperature across time. Systolic BP was higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3 hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to low voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were observed.</p><p>The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs decreased O<span class="Sub">2</span> saturation to the same degree.</p><p class="First">Physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of buprenorphine tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone tablets were similar at equivalent dose levels of buprenorphine. Naloxone had no clinically significant effect when administered by the sublingual route, although blood levels of the drug were measurable. Buprenorphine and naloxone, when administered sublingually to an opioid-dependent cohort, was recognized as an opioid agonist, whereas when administered intramuscularly, combinations of buprenorphine with naloxone produced opioid antagonist actions similar to naloxone. This finding suggests that the naloxone in buprenorphine and naloxone tablets may deter injection of buprenorphine and naloxone tablets by persons with active substantial heroin or other full mu-opioid dependence. However, clinicians should be aware that some opioid-dependent persons, particularly those with a low level of full mu-opioid physical dependence or those whose opioid physical dependence is predominantly to buprenorphine, abuse buprenorphine and naloxone combinations by the intravenous or intranasal route. In methadone-maintained patients and heroin-dependent subjects, IV administration of buprenorphine and naloxone combinations precipitated opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms and was perceived as unpleasant and dysphoric. In morphine-stabilized subjects, intravenously administered combinations of buprenorphine with naloxone produced opioid antagonist and withdrawal signs and symptoms that were ratio-dependent; the most intense withdrawal signs and symptoms were produced by 2:1 and 4:1 ratios, less intense by an 8:1 ratio.</p><p class="First">Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">In several pharmacokinetic studies following the administration of different dosages, a dose of one or two of the 2 mg/0.5 mg Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Films administered sublingually or buccally showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets. In contrast, one 8 mg/2 mg and one 12 mg/3 mg Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Films administered sublingually or buccally showed higher relative bioavailability for both buprenorphine and naloxone compared to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets. A combination of one 8 mg/2 mg and two 2 mg/0.5 mg Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Films (total dose of 12 mg/3 mg) administered sublingually showed comparable relative bioavailability to the same total dose of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, while buccally administered Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Films showed higher relative bioavailability.
