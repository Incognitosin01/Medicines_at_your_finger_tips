</ul><h2>Tri-Vite Drops with Fluroide - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite. </p><p>The reaction may be expressed by the equation:</p><p></p><p>Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:</p><p>1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed.</p><p>2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted.</p><p>3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Tri-Vite Drops with Fluroide</h2><p class="First">Supplementation of the diet with vitamins A, C and D. Tri-Vite Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg also provides fluoride for caries prophylaxis.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride, and children 3-6 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride, receive 0.5 mg of supplemental fluoride daily which is provided in a dose of 1 mL of Tri-Vite Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg <span class="Bold">(See</span> <span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration</span><span class="Bold">).</span></p><p>Tri-Vite Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg supply significant amounts of vitamins A, C and D to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain essential vitamins and fluoride.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">As in the case of all medications, keep out of reach of children.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride.</p><p>When prescribing vitamin fluoride products:</p><p>1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water.</p><p>2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other medications and swallowed toothpaste. </p><p>3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis.</p><p>Tri-Vite Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50 mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.)</p><p>Important Considerations When Using Dosage Schedule:</p><p>• If fluoride level is unknown, drinking water should be tested for fluoride content before supplements are prescribed. For testing of fluoride content, contact the local or state health department.</p><p>• All sources of fluoride should be evaluated with a thorough fluoride history. Patient exposure to multiple water sources can make proper prescribing complex.</p><p>• Ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by children has been associated with an increase in mild dental fluorosis in developing, unerupted teeth.</p><p>• Fluoride supplements require long-term compliance on a daily basis.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported. </p><h2>Tri-Vite Drops with Fluroide Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">1.0 mL daily or as directed by physician. May be dropped directly into the mouth with dropper; or mixed with cereal, fruit juice or other food.</p><p>Tri-Vite Drops with Fluoride 0.5 mg is available in 50 mL bottles with accompanying calibrated dropper.</p><h2>RECOMMENDED STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F), excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (between 59°F and 86°F). After opening, store away from direct light. Close tightly after each use. Occasional deepening of color has no significant effect on vitamin potency.</p><p>REFRIGERATION IS NOT REQUIRED.<br/>
