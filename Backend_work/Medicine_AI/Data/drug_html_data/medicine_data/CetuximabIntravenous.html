Cetuximab injection is also used alone in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who have received other medicines that did not work well.</p><p>Cetuximab injection is used together with other medicines (eg, irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin) to treat K-Ras wild-type, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Your doctor will test for the presence of this gene mutation. Cetuximab injection is also used alone to treat patients with mCRC who have received other medicines (eg, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) that did not work well.</p><p>Cetuximab interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are then destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by cetuximab, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor.
