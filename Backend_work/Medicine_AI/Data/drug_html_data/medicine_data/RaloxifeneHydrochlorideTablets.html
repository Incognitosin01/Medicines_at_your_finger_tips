</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets</h2><h3>Treatment and Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Reduction in the Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP is indicated for the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Reduction in the Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk of Invasive Breast Cancer</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP is indicated for the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk of invasive breast cancer <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span>.</p><p>The effect in the reduction in the incidence of breast cancer was shown in a study of postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer with a 5-year planned duration with a median follow-up of 4.3 years <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span>. Twenty-seven percent of the participants received drug for 5 years. The long-term effects and the recommended length of treatment are not known.</p><p>High risk of breast cancer is defined as at least one breast biopsy showing lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical hyperplasia, one or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer, or a 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer ≥1.66% (based on the modified Gail model). Among the factors included in the modified Gail model are the following: current age, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of breast biopsies, age at menarche, nulliparity or age of first live birth. Currently, no single clinical finding or test result can quantify risk of breast cancer with certainty.</p><p>After an assessment of the risk of developing breast cancer, the decision regarding therapy with Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP should be based upon an individual assessment of the benefits and risks.</p><p>Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP does not eliminate the risk of breast cancer. Patients should have breast exams and mammograms before starting Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP and should continue regular breast exams and mammograms in keeping with good medical practice after beginning treatment with Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP.</p><p><span class="Bold">Important Limitations of Use for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction</span></p><h2>Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosing</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage is one Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP 60 mg daily, which may be administered any time of day without regard to meals <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>For the indications in risk of invasive breast cancer the optimum duration of treatment is not known <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation</h3><p class="First">For either osteoporosis treatment or prevention, supplemental calcium and/or vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate. Postmenopausal women require an average of 1500 mg/day of elemental calcium. Total daily intake of calcium above 1500 mg has not demonstrated additional bone benefits while daily intake above 2000 mg has been associated with increased risk of adverse effects, including hypercalcemia and kidney stones. The recommended intake of vitamin D is 400 to 800 IU daily. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) may need additional vitamin D supplements. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">60 mg, white to off-white, oval, biconvex, film coated tablets (not scored). They are debossed with ‘SG’ on one side and ‘306’ on other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Venous Thromboembolism</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene is contraindicated in women with active or past history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets, USP is contraindicated for use in pregnancy, as it may cause fetal harm <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)<span class="following_xmChange">]</span></span><span class="following_xmChange">.</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Venous Thromboembolism</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, raloxifene-treated women had an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Other venous thromboembolic events also could occur. A less serious event, superficial thrombophlebitis, also has been reported more frequently with raloxifene than with placebo. The greatest risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism occurs during the first 4 months of treatment, and the magnitude of risk appears to be similar to the reported risk associated with use of hormone therapy. Because immobilization increases the risk for venous thromboembolic events independent of therapy, raloxifene should be discontinued at least 72 hours prior to and during prolonged immobilization (e.g., post-surgical recovery, prolonged bed rest), and raloxifene therapy should be resumed only after the patient is fully ambulatory. In addition, women taking raloxifene should be advised to move about periodically during prolonged travel. The risk-benefit balance should be considered in women at risk of thromboembolic disease for other reasons, such as congestive heart failure, superficial thrombophlebitis, and active malignancy <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Death Due to Stroke</h3><p class="First">In a clinical trial of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events, an increased risk of death due to stroke was observed after treatment with raloxifene. During an average follow-up of 5.6 years, 59 (1.2%) raloxifene-treated women died due to a stroke compared to 39 (0.8%) placebo-treated women (22 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years; hazard ratio 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 2.24; p=0.0499). There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the incidence of stroke (249 in raloxifene [4.9%] versus 224 placebo [4.4%]). Raloxifene had no significant effect on all-cause mortality. The risk-benefit balance should be considered in women at risk for stroke, such as prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Disease</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene should not be used for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In a clinical trial of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events, no cardiovascular benefit was demonstrated after treatment with raloxifene for 5 years <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Premenopausal Use</h3><p class="First">There is no indication for premenopausal use of raloxifene. Safety of raloxifene in premenopausal women has not been established and its use is not recommended. Additionally, there is concern regarding inadvertent drug exposure in pregnancy in women of reproductive potential who become pregnant, due to risk of fetal harm <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Estrogen Therapy</h3><p class="First">The safety of concomitant use of raloxifene with systemic estrogens has not been established and its use is not recommended.</p><h3>History of Hypertriglyceridemia when Treated with Estrogens</h3><p class="First">Limited clinical data suggest that some women with a history of marked hypertriglyceridemia (&gt;5.6 mmol/L or &gt;500 mg/dL) in response to treatment with oral estrogen or estrogen plus progestin may develop increased levels of triglycerides when treated with raloxifene. Women with this medical history should have serum triglycerides monitored when taking raloxifene.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene should be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>History of Breast Cancer</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene has not been adequately studied in women with a prior history of breast cancer.</p><h3>Use in Men</h3><p class="First">There is no indication for the use of raloxifene in men. Raloxifene has not been adequately studied in men and its use is not recommended.</p><h3>Unexplained Uterine Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Any unexplained uterine bleeding should be investigated as clinically indicated. Raloxifene-treated and placebo-treated groups had similar incidences of endometrial proliferation <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Breast Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Any unexplained breast abnormality occurring during raloxifene therapy should be investigated. Raloxifene does not eliminate the risk of breast cancer <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to raloxifene in 8429 patients who were enrolled in placebo-controlled trials, including 6666 exposed for 1 year and 5685 for at least 3 years.</p><p><span class="Bold">Osteoporosis Treatment Clinical Trial (MORE)</span> — The safety of raloxifene in the treatment of osteoporosis was assessed in a large (7705 patients) multinational, placebo- controlled trial. Duration of treatment was 36 months, and 5129 postmenopausal women were exposed to raloxifene (2557 received 60 mg/day, and 2572 received 120 mg/day). The incidence of all-cause mortality was similar among groups: 23 (0.9%) placebo, 13 (0.5%) raloxifene-treated (raloxifene HCl 60 mg), and 28 (1.1%) raloxifene HCl 120 mg women died. Therapy was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 10.9% of raloxifene-treated women and 8.8% of placebo-treated women.</p><p><span class="Italics">Venous Thromboembolism:</span> The most serious adverse reaction related to raloxifene was VTE (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis). During an average of study-drug exposure of 2.6 years, VTE occurred in about 1 out of 100 patients treated with raloxifene. Twenty-six raloxifene-treated women had a VTE compared to 11 placebo-treated women, the hazard ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.2, 4.5), and the highest VTE risk was during the initial months of treatment.</p><p>Common adverse reactions considered to be related to raloxifene therapy were hot flashes and leg cramps. Hot flashes occurred in about one in 10 patients on raloxifene and were most commonly reported during the first 6 months of treatment and were not different from placebo thereafter. Leg cramps occurred in about one in 14 patients on raloxifene.</p><p><span class="Bold">Placebo-Controlled Osteoporosis Prevention Clinical Trials</span> — The safety of raloxifene has been assessed primarily in 12 Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies with placebo, estrogen, and estrogen-progestin therapy control groups. The duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 30 months, and 2036 women were exposed to raloxifene HCl (371 patients received 10 to 50 mg/day, 828 received 60 mg/day, and 837 received from 120 to 600 mg/day).</p><p>Therapy was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 11.4% of 581 raloxifene-treated women and 12.2% of 584 placebo-treated women. Discontinuation rates due to hot flashes did not differ significantly between raloxifene and placebo groups (1.7% and 2.2%, respectively).</p><p>Common adverse reactions considered to be drug-related were hot flashes and leg cramps. Hot flashes occurred in about one in four patients on raloxifene versus about one in six on placebo. The first occurrence of hot flashes was most commonly reported during the first 6 months of treatment.</p><p>Table 1 lists adverse reactions occurring in either the osteoporosis treatment or in five prevention placebo-controlled clinical trials at a frequency ≥2.0% in either group and in more raloxifene-treated women than in placebo-treated women. Adverse reactions are shown without attribution of causality. The majority of adverse reactions occurring during the studies were mild and generally did not require discontinuation of therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prevention</span></p><p class="First">Raloxifene Hydrochloride<br/>

<span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
In the developmental and reproductive toxicity studies conducted with raloxifene, numerous adverse effects were observed in multiple animal species. In rabbits dosed during organogenesis, abortion and a low rate of fetal heart anomalies (ventricular septal defects) occurred at doses ≥0.1 mg/kg (≥0.04 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). In rats dosed during organogenesis, retardation of fetal growth and developmental abnormalities (wavy ribs, kidney cavitation) occurred at doses ≥1 mg/kg (≥0.2 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Treatment of rats during gestation and lactation with doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg (0.02 to 1.6 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) produced effects that included delayed and disrupted parturition, decreased neonatal survival and altered physical development, sex- and age-specific reductions in growth and changes in pituitary hormone content, and decreased lymphoid compartment size in offspring. At 10 mg/kg, the disruption of parturition resulted in maternal and progeny morbidity and death. Effects in adult offspring (4 months of age) included uterine hypoplasia and reduced fertility; however, no ovarian or vaginal pathology was observed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Raloxifene is not indicated for use in females of reproductive potential. There is no information on the presence of raloxifene in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.

USP Dissolution Test is pending.</p><h2>Raloxifene Hydrochloride Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Raloxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist, commonly referred to as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and blockade of estrogenic pathways in others (antagonism). The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promoters.</p><p>Raloxifene appears to act as an estrogen agonist in bone. It decreases bone resorption and bone turnover, increases bone mineral density (BMD) and decreases fracture incidence. Preclinical data demonstrate that raloxifene is an estrogen antagonist in uterine and breast tissues. These results are consistent with findings in clinical trials, which suggest that raloxifene lacks estrogen-like effects on the uterus and breast tissue.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Decreases in estrogen levels after oophorectomy or menopause lead to increases in bone resorption and accelerated bone loss. Bone is initially lost rapidly because the compensatory increase in bone formation is inadequate to offset resorptive losses. In addition to loss of estrogen, this imbalance between resorption and formation may be due to age-related impairment of osteoblasts or their precursors. In some women, these changes will eventually lead to decreased bone mass, osteoporosis, and increased risk for fractures, particularly of the spine, hip, and wrist. Vertebral fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women.</p><p>In both the osteoporosis treatment and prevention trials, raloxifene resulted in consistent, statistically significant suppression of bone resorption and bone formation, as reflected by changes in serum and urine markers of bone turnover (e.g., bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and collagen breakdown products). The suppression of bone turnover markers was evident by 3 months and persisted throughout the 36-month and 24-month observation periods.</p><p>In a 31-week, open-label, radiocalcium kinetics study, 33 early postmenopausal women were randomized to treatment with once-daily raloxifene hydrochloride 60 mg, cyclic estrogen/progestin (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens daily with 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for the first 2 weeks of each month [hormone therapy]), or no treatment. Treatment with either raloxifene or hormone therapy was associated with reduced bone resorption and a positive shift in calcium balance (-82 mg Ca/day and +60 mg Ca/day, respectively, for raloxifene and -162 mg Ca/day and +91 mg Ca/day, respectively, for hormone therapy).<br/>
There were small decreases in serum total calcium, inorganic phosphate, total protein, and albumin, which were generally of lesser magnitude than decreases observed during estrogen or hormone therapy. Platelet count was also decreased slightly and was not different from estrogen therapy.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The disposition of raloxifene has been evaluated in more than 3000 postmenopausal women in selected raloxifene osteoporosis treatment and prevention clinical trials, using a population approach. Pharmacokinetic data also were obtained in conventional pharmacology studies in 292 postmenopausal women. Raloxifene exhibits high within-subject variability (approximately 30% coefficient of variation) of most pharmacokinetic parameters. Table 3 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters of raloxifene.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span> — Raloxifene is absorbed rapidly after oral administration. Approximately 60% of an oral dose is absorbed, but presystemic glucuronide conjugation is extensive. Absolute bioavailability of raloxifene is 2%. The time to reach average maximum plasma concentration and bioavailability are functions of systemic interconversion and enterohepatic cycling of raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites.<br/>
<br/>
Administration of raloxifene HCl with a standardized, high-fat meal increases the absorption of raloxifene (C<span class="Sub">max</span> 28% and AUC 16%), but does not lead to clinically meaningful changes in systemic exposure. Raloxifene can be administered without regard to meals.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span> — Following oral administration of single doses ranging from 30 to 150 mg of raloxifene HCl, the apparent volume of distribution is 2348 L/kg and is not dose dependent.<br/>
<br/>
Raloxifene and the monoglucuronide conjugates are highly (95%) bound to plasma proteins. Raloxifene binds to both albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, but not to sex-steroid binding globulin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span> — Biotransformation and disposition of raloxifene in humans have been determined following oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled raloxifene. Raloxifene undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to the glucuronide conjugates: raloxifene-4′-glucuronide, raloxifene-6-glucuronide, and raloxifene-6,4′-diglucuronide. No other metabolites have been detected, providing strong evidence that raloxifene is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 pathways. Unconjugated raloxifene comprises less than 1% of the total radiolabeled material in plasma. The terminal log-linear portions of the plasma concentration curves for raloxifene and the glucuronides are generally parallel. This is consistent with interconversion of raloxifene and the glucuronide metabolites.<br/>
<br/>
Following intravenous administration, raloxifene is cleared at a rate approximating hepatic blood flow. Apparent oral clearance is 44.1 L/kg•hr. Raloxifene and its glucuronide conjugates are interconverted by reversible systemic metabolism and enterohepatic cycling, thereby prolonging its plasma elimination half-life to 27.7 hours after oral dosing.<br/>
<br/>
Results from single oral doses of raloxifene predict multiple-dose pharmacokinetics. Following chronic dosing, clearance ranges from 40 to 60 L/kg•hr. Increasing doses of raloxifene HCl (ranging from 30 to 150 mg) result in slightly less than a proportional increase in the area under the plasma time concentration curve (AUC).</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span> — Raloxifene is primarily excreted in feces, and less than 0.2% is excreted unchanged in urine. Less than 6% of the raloxifene dose is eliminated in urine as glucuronide conjugates.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C<span class="Sub">max</span><span class="Sup">a, b</span></span><br/>

There were no discernible differences in raloxifene plasma concentrations among these groups; however, the influence of race cannot be conclusively determined.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span> — In the osteoporosis treatment and prevention trials, raloxifene concentrations in women with mild renal impairment are similar to women with normal creatinine clearance. When a single dose of 120 mg raloxifene HCl was administered to 10 renally impaired males [7 moderate impairment (CrCl = 31 to 50 mL/min); 3 severe impairment (CrCl ≤30 mL/min)] and to 10 healthy males (CrCl &gt;80 mL/min), plasma raloxifene concentrations were 122% (AUC <span class="Sub">0-∞</span>) higher in renally impaired patients than those of healthy volunteers. Raloxifene should be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span> — The disposition of raloxifene was compared in 9 patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ranging from 0.6 to 2 mg/dL) to 8 subjects with normal hepatic function following a single dose of 60 mg raloxifene HCl. Apparent clearance of raloxifene was reduced 56% and the half-life of raloxifene was not altered in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Plasma raloxifene concentrations were approximately 150% higher than those in healthy volunteers and correlated with total bilirubin concentrations. The pharmacokinetics of raloxifene has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Raloxifene should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Cholestyramine</span> — Cholestyramine, an anion exchange resin, causes a 60% reduction in the absorption and enterohepatic cycling of raloxifene after a single dose.

The concomitant administration of raloxifene and warfarin, a coumarin derivative, has been assessed in a single-dose study. In this study, raloxifene had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. However, a 10% decrease in prothrombin time was observed in the single-dose study. In the osteoporosis treatment trial, there were no clinically relevant effects of warfarin co-administration on plasma concentrations of raloxifene <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Highly Protein-Bound Drugs</span> — In the osteoporosis treatment trial, there were no clinically relevant effects of co-administration of other highly protein-bound drugs (e.g., gemfibrozil) on plasma concentrations of raloxifene. In vitro, raloxifene did not interact with the binding of phenytoin, tamoxifen, or warfarin (<span class="Italics">see</span> above) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Ampicillin and Amoxicillin</span> — Peak concentrations of raloxifene and the overall extent of absorption are reduced 28% and 14%, respectively, with co-administration of ampicillin. These reductions are consistent with decreased enterohepatic cycling associated with antibiotic reduction of enteric bacteria. However, the systemic exposure and the elimination rate of raloxifene were not affected. In the osteoporosis treatment trial, co-administration of amoxicillin had no discernible differences in plasma raloxifene concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Antacids</span> — Concomitant administration of calcium carbonate or aluminum and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids does not affect the systemic exposure of raloxifene <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Corticosteroids</span> — The chronic administration of raloxifene in postmenopausal women has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylprednisolone given as a single oral dose <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digoxin</span> — Raloxifene has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cyclosporine</span> — Concomitant administration of raloxifene with cyclosporine has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Italics">Lipid -Lowering Agents</span> — Concomitant administration of raloxifene with lipid-lowering agents has not been studied.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span> — In a 21-month carcinogenicity study in mice, there was an increased incidence of ovarian tumors in female animals given 9 to 242 mg/kg, which included benign and malignant tumors of granulosa/theca cell origin and benign tumors of epithelial cell origin. Systemic exposure (AUC) of raloxifene in this group was 0.3 to 34 times that in postmenopausal women administered a 60 mg dose. There was also an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell tumors and prostatic adenomas and adenocarcinomas in male mice given 41 or 210 mg/kg (4.7 or 24 times the AUC in humans) and prostatic leiomyoblastoma in male mice given 210 mg/kg.</p><p>In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, an increased incidence in ovarian tumors of granulosa/theca cell origin was observed in female rats given 279 mg/kg (approximately 400 times the AUC in humans). The female rodents in these studies were treated during their reproductive lives when their ovaries were functional and responsive to hormonal stimulation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span> — Raloxifene HCl was not genotoxic in any of the following test systems: the Ames test for bacterial mutagenesis with and without metabolic activation, the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rat hepatocytes, the mouse lymphoma assay for mammalian cell mutation, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamsters, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test in mice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span> — When male and female rats were given daily doses ≥5 mg/kg (≥0.8 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) prior to and during mating, no pregnancies occurred. In male rats, daily doses up to 100 mg/kg (16 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) for at least 2 weeks did not affect sperm production or quality or reproductive performance. In female rats, at doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.02 to 1.6 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), raloxifene disrupted estrous cycles and inhibited ovulation. These effects of raloxifene were reversible. In another study in rats in which raloxifene was given during the preimplantation period at doses ≥0.1 mg/kg (≥0.02 times the human dose based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), raloxifene delayed and disrupted embryo implantation, resulting in prolonged gestation and reduced litter size. The reproductive and developmental effects observed in animals are consistent with the estrogen receptor activity of raloxifene.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">The skeletal effects of raloxifene treatment were assessed in ovariectomized rats and monkeys. In rats, raloxifene prevented increased bone resorption and bone loss after ovariectomy. There were positive effects of raloxifene on bone strength, but the effects varied with time. Cynomolgus monkeys were treated with raloxifene or conjugated estrogens for 2 years. In terms of bone cycles, this is equivalent to approximately 6 years in humans. Raloxifene and estrogen suppressed bone turnover and increased BMD in the lumbar spine and in the central cancellous bone of the proximal tibia. In this animal model, there was a positive correlation between vertebral compressive breaking force and BMD of the lumbar spine.</p><p>Histologic examination of bone from rats and monkeys treated with raloxifene showed no evidence of woven bone, marrow fibrosis, or mineralization defects.</p><p>These results are consistent with data from human studies of radiocalcium kinetics and markers of bone metabolism, and are consistent with the action of raloxifene as a skeletal antiresorptive agent.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effect on Fracture Incidence</span></p><p>The effects of raloxifene on fracture incidence and BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were examined at 3 years in a large randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational osteoporosis treatment trial (MORE). All vertebral fractures were diagnosed radiographically; some of these fractures also were associated with symptoms (i.e., clinical fractures). The study population consisted of 7705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis as defined by: a) low BMD (vertebral or hip BMD at least 2.5 standard deviations below the mean value for healthy young women) without baseline vertebral fractures or b) one or more baseline vertebral fractures.

There were 56 paired biopsies evaluable for all indices. In raloxifene-treated patients, there were statistically significant decreases in bone formation rate per tissue volume, consistent with a reduction in bone turnover. Normal bone quality was maintained; specifically, there was no evidence of osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis, cellular toxicity, or woven bone after 2 years of treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect on Endometrium</span></p><p>Endometrial thickness was evaluated annually in a subset of the study population (1781 patients) for 3 years. Placebo-treated women had a 0.27 mm mean decrease from baseline in endometrial thickness over 3 years, whereas the raloxifene-treated women had a 0.06 mm mean increase. Patients in the osteoporosis treatment study were not screened at baseline or excluded for pre-existing endometrial or uterine disease. This study was not specifically designed to detect endometrial polyps. Over the 36 months of the study, clinically or histologically benign endometrial polyps were reported in 17 of 1999 placebo-treated women, 37 of 1948 raloxifene-treated women, and in 31 of 2010 women treated with raloxifene HCl 120 mg/day. There was no difference between raloxifene- and placebo-treated women in the incidences of endometrial carcinoma, vaginal bleeding, or vaginal discharge.</p><h3>Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First">The effects of raloxifene on BMD in postmenopausal women were examined in three randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind osteoporosis prevention trials: (1) a North American trial enrolled 544 women; (2) a European trial, 601 women; and (3) an international trial, 619 women who had undergone hysterectomy. In these trials, all women received calcium supplementation (400 to 600 mg/day). Women enrolled in these trials had a median age of 54 years and a median time since menopause of 5 years (less than 1 year up to 15 years postmenopause). The majority of the women were White (93.5%). Women were included if they had spine BMD between 2.5 standard deviations below and 2 standard deviations above the mean value for healthy young women. The mean T scores (number of standard deviations above or below the mean in healthy young women) for the three trials ranged from -1.01 to -0.74 for spine BMD and included women both with normal and low BMD. Raloxifene hydrochloride 60 mg administered once daily, produced increases in bone mass versus calcium supplementation alone, as reflected by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometric (DXA) measurements of hip, spine, and total body BMD.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect on Bone Mineral Density</span></p><p>Compared with placebo, the increases in BMD for each of the three studies were statistically significant at 12 months and were maintained at 24 months <span class="Italics">(see</span> Table 6).

After 4 years, raloxifene 60 mg administered once daily, reduced the incidence of all breast cancers by 62%, compared with placebo (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.67). Raloxifene reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 71%, compared with placebo (ARR 3.1 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to an 80% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the raloxifene group compared with placebo. Table 7 presents efficacy and selected safety outcomes.</p><p><span class="Bold">CORE Trial</span></p><p>The effect of raloxifene on the incidence of invasive breast cancer was evaluated for 4 additional years in a follow-up study conducted in a subset of postmenopausal women originally enrolled in the MORE osteoporosis treatment trial. Women were not re-randomized; the treatment assignment from the osteoporosis treatment trial was carried forward to this study. Raloxifene 60 mg administered once daily, reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 56%, compared with placebo (ARR 3.0 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to a 63% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the raloxifene group compared with placebo. There was no reduction in the incidence of ER-negative breast cancer. In the osteoporosis treatment trial and the follow-up study, there was no difference in incidence of noninvasive breast cancer between the raloxifene and placebo groups. Table 7 presents efficacy and selected safety outcomes.</p><p>In a subset of postmenopausal women followed for up to 8 years from randomization in MORE to the end of CORE, raloxifene hydrochloride 60 mg administered once daily, reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by 60% in women assigned raloxifene (hydrochloride N=1355) compared with placebo (N=1286) (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21, 0.77; ARR 1.95 per 1000 women-years); this was primarily due to a 65% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the raloxifene hydrochloride group compared with placebo.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Outcomes</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MORE</span><br/>

The observed incidence rates of invasive breast cancer were raloxifene hydrochloride 4.4 and tamoxifen 4.3 per 1000 women per year. The results from a noninferiority analysis are consistent with raloxifene hydrochloride potentially losing up to 35% of the tamoxifen effect on reduction of invasive breast cancer. The effect of each treatment on invasive breast cancer was consistent when women were compared by baseline age, history of LCIS, history of atypical hyperplasia, 5-year predicted risk of breast cancer by the modified Gail model, or the number of relatives with a history of breast cancer.
