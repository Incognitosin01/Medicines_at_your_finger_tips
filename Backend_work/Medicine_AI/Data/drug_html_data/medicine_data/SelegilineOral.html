Selegiline works to increase and extend the effects of levodopa, and may help to slow the progress of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Selegiline is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using selegiline</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For selegiline, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to selegiline or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of selegiline in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of selegiline in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (such as hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, unusual drowsiness), which may require caution for patients receiving selegiline.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking selegiline, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using selegiline with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of selegiline</h2><p><i>Take selegiline only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>It is best to take the <i>capsules</i> or <i>tablets</i> in the morning during breakfast and lunch. You should not use it with dinner because you may have trouble sleeping.</p><p>If you are using the <i>disintegrating tablet</i>, make sure your hands are dry before you handle the tablet. Do not open the blister pack that contains the tablet until you are ready to take it. Remove the tablet from the blister pack by peeling back the foil, then taking the tablet out. Do not push the tablet through the foil. Do not break or split the tablet. Place the tablet on the top of your tongue, where it will melt quickly. Do not eat food or drink liquids for 5 minutes before or after taking selegiline. It is best to take selegiline before breakfast.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of selegiline will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label.

</ul><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>If you miss a dose of selegiline, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.</p><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using selegiline</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to allow for changes in your dose and to check for any unwanted effects.</p><p>Do not take selegiline if you have used meperidine (eg, Demerol®) or an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) (eg, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, Marplan®, Nardil®, or Parnate®) within the past 14 days. If you do, you may develop agitation, confusion, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, sudden high body temperature, extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions.</p><p>Do not take cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan (Robitussin®, Pediacare®), St. John's wort, or pain medicines (eg, methadone, propoxyphene, tramadol, Darvon®, Dolophine®, Ultram®) while you are using selegiline. <i>Using these medicines together can cause unwanted effects</i>.</p><p>Selegiline may cause a condition called serotonin syndrome when used together with certain MAO inhibitors (eg, phenelzine, rasagiline, tranylcypromine) and medicines to treat depression (eg, amitriptyline, doxepin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, sertraline, Elavil®, Luvox®, Pamelor®, Paxil®, Prozac®, or Zoloft®). Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include: anxiety, restlessness, fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seeing or hearing things that are not there.</p><p>When selegiline is taken at doses of 10 mg or less per day for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, there are no restrictions on food or beverages you eat or drink. However, the chance exists that dangerous reactions, such as sudden high blood pressure, may occur if doses higher than those used for Parkinson's disease are taken with certain foods, beverages, or other medicines. These foods, beverages, and medicines include:</p><ul>
<li>Foods that have a high tyramine content (most common in foods that are aged or fermented to increase their flavor), such as cheeses, fava or broad bean pods, yeast or meat extracts, smoked or pickled meat, poultry, or fish, fermented sausage (bologna, pepperoni, salami, summer sausage) or other fermented meat, sauerkraut, or any overripe fruit. If a list of these foods and beverages is not given to you, ask your doctor to provide one.</li>
<li>Alcoholic beverages or alcohol-free or reduced-alcohol beer and wine.</li>
<li>Large amounts of caffeine-containing food or beverages such as coffee, tea, cola, or chocolate.</li>
<li>Any other medicine unless approved or prescribed by your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine, such as that for colds (including nose drops or sprays), cough, asthma, hay fever, and appetite control, “keep awake” products, or products that make you sleepy.</li>
</ul><p>Also, for at least 2 weeks after you stop taking selegiline, these foods, beverages, and other medicines may continue to react with selegiline if it was taken in doses higher than those usually used for Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Check with your doctor or hospital emergency room immediately if severe headache, stiff neck, chest pains, fast heartbeat, or nausea and vomiting occur while you are taking selegiline. These may be symptoms of a serious side effect that should have a doctor's attention.</p><p>Selegiline may make you drowsy. It may even cause you to fall asleep without warning while you drive, talk, or eat. <i>Do not drive or do anything that could be dangerous until you know how selegiline affects you</i>.</p><p><i>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur</i>, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain when swallowing, pain in the mouth, redness, swelling, or sores in your mouth while receiving selegiline.</p><p>Selegiline may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.</p><p>Some people who have used selegiline had unusual changes in their behavior. Talk with your doctor if you start having problems with gambling or increased interest in sex while using selegiline.</p><p><i>Do not stop taking selegiline without first checking with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you to reduce gradually the amount you are taking before stopping completely.</p><p>It is important that your doctor check your skin regularly for signs of a skin cancer called melanoma. If you notice any unusual red, brown, or black spots on your skin, talk to your doctor right away.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Selegiline side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
