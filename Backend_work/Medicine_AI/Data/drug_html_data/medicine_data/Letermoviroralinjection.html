Letermovir is for use in adults who are seropositive for CMV. Seropositive means that the virus is in your blood even if you do not show any symptoms of infection.</p><p>A CMV-seropositive person is at risk for "reactivation" of the virus if the immune system becomes weak. While normally treatable, CMV infection can be serious in people undergoing a stem cell transplant.</p><p>Letermovir may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using.
