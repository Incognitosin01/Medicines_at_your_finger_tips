It is also used to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.</p><p>Albuterol inhalation is for use in adults and children who are at least 4 years old. <b>Always follow your doctor's directions when giving albuterol to a child.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>It is important to keep albuterol on hand at all times. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely. Keep using all of your other medications as prescribed by your doctor.</p><p>Talk with your doctor if any of your asthma medications do not seem to work as well in treating or preventing attacks. If it seems like you need to use more of any of your medications in a 24-hour period, talk with your doctor. An increased need for medication could be an early sign of a serious asthma attack.</p><p>Only use albuterol as prescribed by your physician. An overdose of albuterol can be fatal. Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. An overdose of albuterol can be fatal.
