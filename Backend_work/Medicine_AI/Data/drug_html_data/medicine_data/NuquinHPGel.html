</ul><p class="First">SKIN BLEACHING TOPICAL GEL WITH SUNSCREENS</p><p>Rx only</p><p><span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY: NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC, NASAL, OR OTIC USE.</span></p><h2>Nuquin HP Gel Description</h2><p class="First">Each gram of <span class="Bold">NUQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% GEL</span> (Hydroquinone 4%) Contains: <span class="Bold">ACTIVES:</span> 40 mg of Hydroquinone USP, 50 mg of Padimate O USP and 30 mg of Dioxybenzone USP in a hydroalcoholic base of: <span class="Bold">INACTIVES:</span> Alcohol, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Purified Water, Sodium Metabisulfite and Trolamine. Hydroquinone is 1, 4-Benzenediol. Hydroquinone is structurally related to monobenzone. Hydroquinone occurs as fine, white needles. The drug is freely soluble in water and in alcohol and has a pKa of 9.96. Chemically, hydroquinone is designated as p-dihydroxybenzene; the empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> and has a molecular weight of 110.11.</p><p>The structural formula is:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>0<span class="Sub">2</span></p><h2>Nuquin HP Gel - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Topical application of hydroquinone produces a reversible depigmentation of the skin by the inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) [Denton, C., et al., 19521] and suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes [Jimbow, K., et al., 19742]. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas [Parrish, J.A. et al., 19783].</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Nuquin HP Gel</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NUQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% GEL</span> is indicated for the gradual bleaching of hyperpigmented skin conditions such as chloasma, melasma, freckles, senile lentigines and other undesired areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NUQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% GEL</span> is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to hydroquinone or any of the other ingredients. The safety of topical treatment of hydroquinone during pregnancy or in children (12 years and under) has not been established. (See PRECAUTIONS).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">1. Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce undesired effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.</p><p>2. To evaluate possible susceptibility to irritation or sensitivity, each patient should begin by applying the medication to a small portion of unbroken skin at or near the pigmented area over a period of several days. Minor redness is not necessarily a contraindication, but treatment should be discontinued if itching, excessive inflammation or vesicle formation occurs. Use of <span class="Bold">NUQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% GEL</span> in paranasal and infraorbital areas increases the chance of irritations (See ADVERSE REACTIONS). If no improvement is seen after two months of treatment, use of this product should be discontinued.</p><p>3. Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of the hydroquinone therapy because even minimal sunlight exposure sustains melanocytic activity. The sunscreens in <span class="Bold">NUQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% GEL</span> provide the necessary sun protection during the process of skin bleaching. After clearing and during the maintenance period of therapy, sun exposure should be avoided on the bleached skin by the application of a suncreen or a sunblock agent, or protective clothing to prevent the skin from repigmenting.</p><p>4. Contains Sodium Metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.</p><p>5. Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion, call a physician or a poison control center immediately.</p><p>6. Avoid contact with eyes. In case of accidental contact, patient should rinse eyes thoroughly with water and contact a physician. A bitter taste and antiseptic effect may occur if applied to the lips.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(SEE WARNINGS)</span></p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hydroquinone. It is also not known whether hydroquinone can cause fetal harm when administered on a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. It is also not known to what degree, if any, topical hydroquinone is absorbed systemically. Topical hydroquinone should be used in pregnant women only when clearly indicated.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether topical administration of hydroquinone is absorbed or excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution is advised when topical hydroquinone is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years has not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur in which case the medication should be discontinued and the physician notified immediately.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no systemic reactions reported from the use of topical hydroquinone treatment. However, treatment should be limited to relatively small areas of the body at one time since some patients may experience a transient skin reddening and a mild burning sensation which does not preclude treatment.</p><h2>Nuquin HP Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NUQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% GEL</span> should be applied to affected areas twice daily, in the morning and before bedtime or as directed by a physician. Unnecessary solar exposure should be avoided. There is no recommended dosage for children under 12 years of age except under the advice and supervision of a physician. Keep container tightly closed. NOTE: Slight darkening of <span class="Bold">NUQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% GEL</span> is normal and does not affect potency of the product.</p><h2>How is Nuquin HP Gel Supplied</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NUQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% GEL</span> (Hydroquinone 4%) is supplied as follows:</p><h3>STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Store at 20ºC to 25ºC (68ºF to 77ºF), excursions permitted between 15ºC and 30ºC (between 59ºF and 86ºF). Brief exposure to temperatures up to 40ºC (104ºF) may be tolerated provided the mean kinetic temperature does not exceed 25ºC (77ºF); however, such exposure should be minimized. [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from freezing. If freezing occurs, warm to room temperature.</p><p>Keep out of the reach of children.
