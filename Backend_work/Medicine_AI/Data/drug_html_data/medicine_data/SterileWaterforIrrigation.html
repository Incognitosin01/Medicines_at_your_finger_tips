</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Sterile Water for Irrigation</h2><p class="First">Sterile Water for Irrigation is indicated for use as an irrigant.</p><h2>Sterile Water for Irrigation Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">The volume and/or rate of irrigation depend on the type of the procedure and the capacity or the surface area of the structure to be irrigated.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">For single-dose only. Sterile Water for Irrigation is available in a flexible plastic container and a plastic pour bottle. Use the contents of the opened container immediately to minimize the potential for bacterial growth and pyrogen formation. Discard the unused contents of opened containers, as Sterile Water for Irrigation contains no antimicrobial preservative.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Adding Medications to Either the Flexible Plastic Container or the Plastic Pour Bottle</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Administration Instructions for Irrigation by Gravity Using the Flexible Plastic Container</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Warming</span></p><p>If desired, warm the flexible plastic container in overwrap to near body temperature in a water bath or fluid warmer heated to not more than 45°C.</p><p>Microwave heating of irrigation fluids is not recommended.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administration Using the Plastic Pour Bottle</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Warming</span></p><p>If desired, warm the plastic pour bottle in a fluid warmer to not more than 50°C for a maximum of 60 days. Discard after 60 days of warming.</p><p>Microwave heating of irrigation fluids is not recommended.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Irrigation:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypotonicity</h3><p class="First">Sterile Water for Irrigation is hypotonic with an osmolarity of zero mOsmol/L. It is intended for use as irrigation fluid and not for intravenous administration or administration by other, usual parenteral routes, such as intravascular administration in general, subcutaneous administration, or intramuscular administration.</p><p>Serious adverse reactions, including cerebral or pulmonary edema, massive hemolysis, and acute renal failure can result from the hypotonicity of Sterile Water for Irrigation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</p><h3>Excessive Water Absorption</h3><p class="First">Due to the hypotonicity, absorption of Sterile Water for Irrigation can result in serious adverse reactions of hyponatremia, hypoosmolality and fluid overload, resulting in fatality or permanent morbidity. Complications include cerebral edema, encephalopathy, pulmonary edema, massive hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In addition, excessive volume or pressure of the irrigation fluid may also cause undue distension of body cavities and may cause tissue disruption (e.g., tears or perforation). These complications can manifest after irrigation has ended and immediate intervention may be required.</p><p>Monitor patients closely for absorption of clinically relevant amounts of fluid during and for an appropriate period after the procedure. If absorption occurs, discontinue Sterile Water for Irrigation.</p><p>Additional close monitoring during and/or after the procedure is recommended for patients at increased risk for developing complications related to hypotonicity, such as:</p><p>Avoid use of Sterile Water for Irrigation in patients with wounds where significant absorption may occur, such as procedures that require irrigation over a longer period of time or an irrigation fluid pressure that promotes absorption (e.g., transurethral resection of prostate). Sterile Water for Irrigation should only be used by clinicians familiar with the treatment of possible complications.</p><h3>Use with Electrosurgery/Cautery</h3><p class="First">In contrast to other irrigation fluids containing electrolytes, Sterile Water for Irrigation is non-conductive. Therefore, when choosing the distension solution/fluid used with electrosurgery or cautery, ensure compatibility with the equipment.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Sterile Water for Irrigation. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition disorders</span>: Hyponatremia, fluid overload, fluid absorption, electrolyte imbalance<br/>
<span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders</span>: Cerebral edema<br/>
<span class="Italics">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions</span>: Burning sensation (with irrigation of eyes and skin wounds)<br/>
<span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders</span>: Rhabdomyolysis (myoglobinuria)<br/>
<span class="Italics">Renal and Urinary Disorders</span>: Renal failure<br/></p><p>Other Adverse reactions which may occur in association with absorption of water for irrigation include:</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders</span>: Hemolysis (hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria)<br/>
<span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders</span>: Hypervolemia, hypoosmolality, hyperkalemia, acid/base balance disorder<br/>
<span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders</span>: Encephalopathy (seizure, loss of vision, lethargy, disorientation, irritability, vomiting, nausea, headache)<br/>
<span class="Italics">Cardiac Disorders</span>: Cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, bradycardia, electrocardiogram abnormal<br/>
<span class="Italics">Vascular Disorders</span>: Hypertension, postoperative hypotension<br/>
<span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> Respiratory arrest, respiratory failure, pulmonary edema</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Appropriate administration of Sterile Water for Irrigation is not expected to cause adverse developmental outcomes. There are no available data on Sterile Water for Irrigation use in pregnant women to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sterile Water for Irrigation.</p><p>All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Appropriate administration of Sterile Water for Irrigation is not expected to cause harm to a breastfed infant. There are no data on the presence of Sterile Water for Irrigation in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of Sterile Water for Irrigation to a breastfed infant; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Sterile Water for Irrigation and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Sterile Water for Irrigation or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are at higher risk compared to adults for developing encephalopathy as a complication of hyponatremia, if there is excessive absorption of Sterile Water for Irrigation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Sterile Water for Irrigation should be used cautiously in older patients. Geriatric patients are more likely to have decreased cardiac, renal, or hepatic function, and other diseases or concomitant drug therapy.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Excessive rate, volume, pressure or duration of irrigation with hypotonic fluid can result in excessive fluid absorption and permanent morbidity or death as a result of hyponatremia, hypoosmolality and/or fluid overload. In the event of clinically relevant absorption of Sterile Water for Irrigation, immediate intervention may be required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</p><h2>Sterile Water for Irrigation Description</h2><p class="First">Sterile Water for Irrigation contains water that is sterilized and packaged for use as an irrigant. No antimicrobial agent or other substance has been added. The pH is 5.5 (5.0 to 7.0). Sterile Water for Irrigation is hypotonic with an osmolarity of zero mOsmol/L.</p><p>The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride. The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the fluid significantly. Water in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials.</p><p>The plastic pour bottle is fabricated from specially formulated polyolefin. The polyolefin is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene. The container requires no vapor barrier.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Sterile Water for Irrigation is supplied in single-dose plastic pour bottles and flexible plastic containers as follows:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Product Codes</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Fill Volume (mL)</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">NDC</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Plastic Pour Bottle</span></p><p class="First">2F7112</p><p class="First">250</p><p class="First">0338-0004-02</p><p class="First">2F7113</p><p class="First">500</p><p class="First">0338-0004-03</p><p class="First">2F7114</p><p class="First">1000</p><p class="First">0338-0004-04</p><p class="First">2F7115</p><p class="First">1500</p><p class="First">0338-0004-05</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Flexible Plastic Container</span></p><p class="First">2B7114</p><p class="First">1000</p><p class="First">0338-0003-44</p><p class="First">2B7116</p><p class="First">2000</p><p class="First">0338-0003-46</p><p class="First">2B7117</p><p class="First">3000</p><p class="First">0338-0003-47</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>Exposure of pharmaceutical products to heat should be minimized.
