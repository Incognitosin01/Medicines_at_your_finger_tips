</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Olmesartan Medoxomil, Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p class="First">Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.</p><p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</p><p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</p><p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.</p><p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>This fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension.</p><h2>Olmesartan Medoxomil, Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Dose once daily. Dosage may be increased in 2-week intervals, as needed. The maximum recommended dose of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is 40 mg/10 mg/25 mg.</p><p>Dose selection should be individualized based on previous therapy.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are available in the following strength combinations:</p><p class="First">20/5/12.5</p><p class="First">40/5/12.5</p><p class="First">40/5/25</p><p class="First">40/10/12.5</p><p class="First">40/10/25</p><p class="First">Olmesartan medoxomil (mg)</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">Amlodipine equivalent (mg)</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Hydrochlorothiazide (mg)</p><p class="First">12.5</p><p class="First">12.5</p><p class="First">25</p><p class="First">12.5</p><p class="First">25</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Because of the hydrochlorothiazide component, olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are contraindicated in patients with anuria, hypersensitivity to any component, or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.</p><p>Do not coadminister aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide.</span> Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. Adverse reactions include fetal or neonatal jaundice and thrombocytopenia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil. </span>In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics) symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan medoxomil. Initiate treatment with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.</p><p><span class="Italics">Amlodipine</span>. Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely.</p><h3>Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Amlodipine</span>. Patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, may develop increased frequency, duration, or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction upon starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated.</p><h3>Impaired Renal Function</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets</span>. Impaired renal function was reported in 2.1% of subjects receiving olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets compared to 0.2% to 1.3% of subjects receiving dual combination therapy of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine, olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p>If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Changes in renal function occur in some individuals treated with olmesartan medoxomil as a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar effects may occur in patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to the olmesartan medoxomil component <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar effects would be expected with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets because of the olmesartan medoxomil component.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide. </span>Thiazides may precipitate azotemia in patients with renal disease. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.</p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Amlodipine.</span> Since amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver and the plasma elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) is 56 hours in patients with severely impaired hepatic function, titrate slowly when administering to patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><h3>Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances</h3><p class="First">Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets contain hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets also contain olmesartan, a drug that affects the RAS. Drugs that inhibit the RAS can also cause hyperkalemia.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.</p><p>Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in patients receiving thiazide therapy.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels.</p><h3>Postsympathectomy Patients</h3><p class="First">The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.</p><h3>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide. </span>Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><h3>Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.</p><h3>Sprue-like Enteropathy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in cases where no other etiology is identified.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Italics">Olmesartan Medoxomil, Amlodipine, and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets</span></p><p>In the controlled trial of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, patients were randomized to olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 40 mg/10 mg/25 mg, olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40 mg/10 mg, olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide 40 mg/25 mg, or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/25 mg. Subjects who received triple combination therapy were treated between two and four weeks with one of the three dual combination therapies. Safety data from this study were obtained in 574 patients with hypertension who received olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets for 8 weeks.</p><p>The frequency of adverse reactions was similar between men and women, patients &lt;65 years of age and patients ≥65 years of age, patients with and without diabetes, and Black and non-Black patients. Discontinuations because of adverse events occurred in 4% of patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, 40 mg/10 mg/25 mg compared to 1% of patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40 mg/10 mg, 2% of patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide 40 mg/25 mg, and 2% of patients treated with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/25 mg. The most common reason for discontinuation with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was dizziness (1%).</p><p>Dizziness was one of the most frequently reported adverse reactions with incidence of 1.4% to 3.6% in subjects continuing on dual combination therapy compared to 5.8% to 8.9% in subjects who switched to olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.</p><p>The other most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of subjects are presented in the table below:</p><p class="First">Adverse Reaction</p><p class="First">OM 40 mg/AML 10 mg/</p><p>HCTZ 25 mg</p><p>(N = 574)</p><p>n (%)</p><p class="First">OM 40 mg/</p><p>AML 10 mg</p><p>(N = 596)</p><p>n (%)</p><p class="First">OM 40 mg/</p><p>HCTZ 25 mg</p><p>(N = 580)</p><p>n (%)</p><p class="First">AML10 mg/</p><p>HCTZ 25 mg</p><p>(N = 552)</p><p>n (%)</p><p class="First">Edema peripheral</p><p class="First">44 (7.7)</p><p class="First">42 (7.0)</p><p class="First">6 (1.0)</p><p class="First">46 (8.3)</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">37 (6.4)</p><p class="First">42 (7.0)</p><p class="First">38 (6.6)</p><p class="First">33 (6.0)</p><p class="First">Fatigue</p><p class="First">24 (4.2)</p><p class="First">34 (5.7)</p><p class="First">31 (5.3)</p><p class="First">36 (6.5)</p><p class="First">Nasopharyngitis</p><p class="First">20 (3.5)</p><p class="First">11 (1.8)</p><p class="First">20 (3.4)</p><p class="First">16 (2.9)</p><p class="First">Muscle spasms</p><p class="First">18 (3.1)</p><p class="First">12 (2.0)</p><p class="First">14 (2.4)</p><p class="First">13 (2.4)</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">17 (3.0)</p><p class="First">12 (2.0)</p><p class="First">22 (3.8)</p><p class="First">12 (2.2)</p><p class="First">Upper respiratory tract infection</p><p class="First">16 (2.8)</p><p class="First">26 (4.4)</p><p class="First">18 (3.1)</p><p class="First">14 (2.5)</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">15 (2.6)</p><p class="First">14 (2.3)</p><p class="First">12 (2.1)</p><p class="First">9 (1.6)</p><p class="First">Urinary tract infection</p><p class="First">14 (2.4)</p><p class="First">8 (1.3)</p><p class="First">6 (1.0)</p><p class="First">7 (1.3)</p><p class="First">Joint swelling</p><p class="First">12 (2.1)</p><p class="First">17 (2.9)</p><p class="First">2 (0.3)</p><p class="First">16 (2.9)</p><p><br/>
Syncope was reported by 1% of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablet subjects compared to 0.5% or less for the other treatment groups.</p><p><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil</span></p><p>Olmesartan medoxomil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. This experience included about 900 patients treated for at least 6 months and more than 525 treated for at least 1 year. Treatment with olmesartan medoxomil was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to that seen with placebo. Adverse reactions were generally mild, transient, and without relationship to the dose of olmesartan medoxomil.</p><p><span class="Italics">Amlodipine</span></p><p>Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil. </span>The following adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> asthenia, angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, peripheral edema<br/>
<span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> vomiting, diarrhea, sprue-like enteropathy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders:</span> hyperkalemia<br/>
<span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> rhabdomyolysis<br/>
<span class="Italics">Urogenital System:</span> acute renal failure, increased blood creatinine<br/>
<span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages:</span> alopecia, pruritus, urticaria</p><p>Data from one controlled trial and an epidemiologic study have suggested that high-dose olmesartan may increase cardiovascular (CV) risk in diabetic patients, but the overall data are not conclusive. The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ROADMAP trial (Randomized Olmesartan And Diabetes MicroAlbuminuria Prevention trial, n = 4447) examined the use of olmesartan, 40 mg daily, vs. placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, normoalbuminuria, and at least one additional risk factor for CV disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, delayed onset of microalbuminuria, but olmesartan had no beneficial effect on decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There was a finding of increased CV mortality (adjudicated sudden cardiac death, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, revascularization death) in the olmesartan group compared to the placebo group (15 olmesartan vs. 3 placebo, HR 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4, 17), but the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction was lower with olmesartan (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35, 1.18).</p><p>The epidemiologic study included patients 65 years and older with overall exposure of &gt; 300,000 patient-years. In the sub-group of diabetic patients receiving high-dose olmesartan (40 mg/d) for &gt; 6 months, there appeared to be an increased risk of death (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1, 3.8) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. In contrast, high-dose olmesartan use in non-diabetic patients appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of death (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. No differences were observed between the groups receiving lower doses of olmesartan compared to other angiotensin blockers or those receiving therapy for &lt; 6 months.</p><p>Overall, these data raise a concern of a possible increased CV risk associated with the use of high-dose olmesartan in diabetic patients. There are, however, concerns with the credibility of the finding of increased CV risk, notably the observation in the large epidemiologic study for a survival benefit in non-diabetics of a magnitude similar to the adverse finding in diabetics.</p><p><span class="Italics">Amlodipine. </span>The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide.</span> <span class="Bold"><br/></span> <span class="Bold">Non-melanoma Skin Cancer</span></p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of ≥50,000mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drug Interactions with Olmesartan Medoxomil</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): </span>In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.</p><p>The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): </span>Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.</p><p>Do not coadminister aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Avoid use of aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR &lt;60 ml/min).</p><p><span class="Italics">Use with Colesevelam Hydrochloride: </span>Concurrent administration of bile acid sequestering agent colesevelam hydrochloride reduces the systemic exposure and peak plasma concentration of olmesartan. Administration of olmesartan at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride decreased the drug interaction effect.

<span class="Italics">Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins:</span> Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single dose of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Corticosteroids, ACTH:</span> Intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs:</span> In some patients the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patients should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

Specifically, amlodipine blocks the contractile effects of calcium on cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells; olmesartan medoxomil blocks the vasoconstriction and sodium retaining effects of angiotensin II on cardiac, vascular smooth muscle, adrenal and renal cells; and hydrochlorothiazide directly promotes the excretion of sodium and chloride in the kidney leading to reductions in intravascular volume. For a more detailed description of the mechanisms of action for each individual component, see below.</p><p><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by ACE, kininase II. Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.</p><p>An AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor than for the AT<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor.</p><p>Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is a mechanism of many drugs used to treat hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because olmesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known.</p><p>Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Amlodipine. </span>Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggests that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nonhydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa = 8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.</p><p>Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide. </span>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.</p><p>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. The three components of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets lower the blood pressure through complementary mechanisms, each working at a separate site and blocking different effects or pathways. The pharmacodynamics of each individual component is described below.</p><p><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil.</span> Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2.5 to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses of olmesartan medoxomil &gt;40 mg giving &gt;90% inhibition at 24 hours.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels and no effect on serum potassium.</p><p><span class="Italics">Amlodipine. </span>Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.</p><p>With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive patients experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg).</p><p>In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.</p><p>As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.</p><p>Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide. </span>After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours, and lasts about 6 to 12 hours.</p><p>Drug Interactions</p><p><span class="Italics">Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics:</span> Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skeletal muscle relaxants, non-depolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine):</span> Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. </span>After oral administration of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in normal healthy adults, peak plasma concentrations of olmesartan, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide are reached in about 1.5 to 3 hours, 6 to 8 hours, and 1.5 to 2 hours, respectively.

To clarify the toxicological profile for olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a 3-month repeated dose toxicity study was conducted in rats, and the results demonstrated that the combined administration of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide neither augment any existing toxicities of the individual agents nor induce any new toxicities and there were no toxicologically synergistic effects observed in the study.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of Olmesartan Medoxomil, Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide. However, these studies have been conducted for Olmesartan Medoxomil, Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide alone.</p><p><span class="Italics">Olmesartan medoxomil. </span>Olmesartan was not carcinogenic when administered by dietary administration to rats for up to 2 years. The highest dose tested (2000 mg/kg/day) was, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, about 480 times the MRHD of 40 mg/day. Two carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice, a 6-month gavage study in the p53 knockout mouse and a 6-month dietary administration study in the Hras2 transgenic mouse, at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, about 120 times the MRHD of 40 mg/day), revealed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of olmesartan.</p><p>Both olmesartan medoxomil and olmesartan tested negative in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Syrian hamster embryo cell transformation assay and showed no evidence of genetic toxicity in the Ames (bacterial mutagenicity) test. However, both were shown to induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (Chinese hamster lung) and tested positive for thymidine kinase mutations in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse lymphoma assay. Olmesartan medoxomil tested negative <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> for mutations in the MutaMouse intestine and kidney and for clastogenicity in mouse bone marrow (micronucleus test) at oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg (olmesartan not tested).</p><p>Fertility of rats was unaffected by administration of olmesartan at dose levels as high as 1000 mg/kg/day (240 times the MRHD of 40 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) in a study in which dosing was begun 2 (female) or 9 (male) weeks prior to mating. (Calculations based on a 60 kg patient.)</p><p><span class="Italics">Amlodipine. </span>Rats and mice treated with amlodipine maleate in the diet for up to 2 years, at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of amlodipine 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of the drug. For the mouse, the highest dose was, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, similar to the MRHD of amlodipine 10 mg/day. For the rat, the highest dose was, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, about two times the MRHD (calculations based on a 60 kg patient).</p><p>Mutagenicity studies conducted with amlodipine maleate revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome level.</p><p>There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of amlodipine up to 10 mg/kg/day (about 10 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrochlorothiazide. </span>Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to approximately 100 mg/kg/day). These doses in mice and rats are about 117 and 39 times, respectively, the MRHD of 25 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. (Calculations based on a 60 kg patient.) The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the Ames mutagenicity assay of <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538, or in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations. It was also not genotoxic <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, Chinese Hamster bone marrow chromosomes, or in <span class="Italics">Drosophila</span> sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Positive test results were obtained in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) assay, the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assay and the <span class="Italics">Aspergillus nidulans</span> nondisjunction assay.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to mating and throughout gestation. These doses in mice and rats are about 19 and 1.5 times, respectively, the MRHD of 25 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.

A total of 2492 patients with hypertension (mean baseline blood pressure 169/101 mmHg) received olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 40 mg/10 mg/25 mg (627 patients), olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40 mg/10 mg (628 patients), olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide 40 mg/25 mg (637 patients), or amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/25 mg (600 patients). Each subject was randomized to one of the three dual therapy combinations for two to four weeks. Patients were then randomized to continue on the dual therapy they were receiving or to receive triple therapy. A total of 53% of patients were male, 19% were 65 years or older, 67% were white, 30% were black, and 15% were diabetic.</p><p>After 8 weeks of treatment, the triple combination therapy produced greater reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p&lt; 0.0001) compared to each of the 3 dual combination therapies.
