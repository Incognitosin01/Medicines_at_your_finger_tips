You may be able to get pregnant if your periods restart.

Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.

Symptoms include headache, hunger, sweating, irritability, dizziness, nausea, fast heart rate, and feeling anxious or shaky. To quickly treat low blood sugar, always keep a fast-acting source of sugar with you such as fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda.</p><p>Your doctor can prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit to use in case you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink. Be sure your family and close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>If you take extra vitamin B12 while you are taking Avandamet, take only the amount of vitamin B12 that your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>Avandamet is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care.
