<li>Fintepla is a prescription medicine used to treat the seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older.</li>
<li><strong>Fintepla is a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains fenfluramine.</strong> Keep this medicine in a safe place to prevent misuse, abuse, and protect it from theft. Never give your Fintepla to anyone else, because it may harm them. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law. Tell your healthcare provider if you have abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs.</li>
<li>It is not known if this medicine is safe and effective in children less than 2 years of age.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Fintepla can cause serious side effects, including:</p><p><strong>1. Problems with the valves in the heart (valvular heart disease) and high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (pulmonary arterial hypertension) have been associated with fenfluramine, the active ingredient in Fintepla.</strong><br/>
Your healthcare provider will do a test called an echocardiogram to check your heart and for high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs before you start treatment, every 6 months during treatment, and one time 3 to 6 months after you take your last dose.<br/>
Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of these signs and symptoms of heart or lung problems during treatment with Fintepla:</p><ul>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>tiredness or weakness especially with increased activity</li>
<li>lightheadedness or fainting</li>
<li>swollen ankles or feet</li>
<li>chest pain</li>
<li>sensations of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat (palpitations)</li>
<li>irregular pulse</li>
<li>bluish color to your lips and skin (cyanosis)</li>
</ul><p>Because of the risk of heart valve problems and pulmonary arterial hypertension Fintepla is only available through a restricted program called the Fintepla Risk Evaluation and Mitigation (REMS) Program. Before you or your child receives Fintepla, your healthcare provider or pharmacist will make sure you understand how to take the medicine safely. If you have any questions, ask your healthcare provider, visit www.FinteplaREMS.com, or call 1-877-964-3649.<br/>
<strong>2. Decreased appetite and decreased weight.</strong> Decreased appetite and decreased weight are both serious and common side effects.</p><ul>
<li>Your weight should be checked regularly during your treatment.</li>
<li>Your healthcare provider may need to make changes to your dose if your weight decreases. In some cases, treatment may need to be stopped.</li>
</ul><p><strong>3. Sleepiness, sedation, and lack of energy (lethargy).</strong> These are both serious and common side effects. Taking Fintepla with central nervous  system (CNS) depressants including alcohol may increase sleepiness. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how Fintepla affects you.<br/>
<strong>4. Like all other antiepileptic drugs, Fintepla may cause suicidal thoughts or actions</strong> in a very small number of people (about 1 in 500).<br/>
Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:</p><ul>
<li>thoughts about suicide or dying</li>
<li>trouble sleeping (insomnia)</li>
<li>attempts to commit suicide</li>
<li>new or worse irritability</li>
<li>new or worse depression</li>
<li>acting aggressive, being angry, or violent</li>
<li>new or worse anxiety</li>
<li>acting on dangerous impulses</li>
<li>feeling agitated or restless</li>
<li>an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)</li>
<li>panic attacks</li>
<li>other unusual changes in behavior or mood<br/>
<strong>How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions?</strong></li>
<li>Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings.</li>
<li>Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled.<br/>
Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes.</li>
</ul><p><strong>5. Do not stop taking Fintepla without first talking to your healthcare provider.</strong> Stopping a seizure medicine such as Fintepla suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that do not stop (status epilepticus).<br/>
Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms.</p><h2>Who should not take Fintepla?</h2><p>Do not take Fintepla if you:</p><ul>
<li>are allergic to fenfluramine or any of the ingredients in Fintepla. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients.</li>
<li>are taking or have stopped taking medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), serotonin agonists or serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the last 14 days.
