It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number and severity of seizures.</p><p>Lacosamide is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using lacosamide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For lacosamide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to lacosamide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of lacosamide injection in children younger than 17 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lacosamide injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving lacosamide injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving lacosamide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using lacosamide with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. The medicine must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for at least 15 to 60 minutes.</p><p>Lacosamide should come with a Medication Guide. It is very important that you read and understand this information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Your doctor may give you a few doses of lacosamide until your condition improves, and then you may be switched to an oral medicine that works the same way. If you have any concerns about this, talk to your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using lacosamide</h2><p><i>Your doctor will check your progress closely while you are receiving lacosamide.

If these side effects are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.</p><p>Lacosamide can cause changes in heart rhythms, such as a condition called PR prolongation. It may change the way your heart beats and cause lightheadedness, fainting, or serious side effects in some patients. Contact your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of heart rhythm problems, such as fast, slow, or irregular heartbeats.</p><p>Lacosamide injection may cause a condition called drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which is a serious allergic reaction affecting multiple body organs (eg, liver or kidney).
