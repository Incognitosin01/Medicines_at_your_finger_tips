Benzoyl peroxide and sulfur are believed to exert a beneficial effect because of their antimicrobial activity and their mild keratolytic action.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BPS Gel™</span> is indicated in the treatment of acne vulgaris. See Directions section below for information on frequency and duration of medication use.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BPS Gel™</span> is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, or to any of the other ingredients in the product.</p><p><span class="Bold">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.

Avoid prolonged sun exposure, tanning booths, and sunlamps.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BPS Gel™</span> is for external use only. Do not come in contact with eyes or mucous membranes (e.g., inside of nose) and any damaged areas of the skin, such as wounds or open sores. If accidental contact with one of these areas occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. If severe irritation develops, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. After reaction clears, treatment may be resumed with less frequent application. Avoid contact with hair, fabrics or carpeting as benzoyl peroxide will cause bleaching.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with <span class="Bold">BPS Gel™</span>. It is also not known whether <span class="Bold">BPS Gel™</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. This product should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether these drugs are excreted in human milk following topical use of <span class="Bold">BPS Gel™</span>.
