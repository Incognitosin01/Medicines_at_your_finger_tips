<html><head></head><body><h1>Enoxaparin</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> enoxaparin (ee-nox-a-PAR-in)</p><p>Epidural or spinal hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis, may occur in patients who are anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids and are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. Factors that can increase the risk of developing these hematomas include: use of indwelling epidural catheters, concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, or other anticoagulants, or history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, spinal deformity, or spinal surgery. Optimal timing between the administration of enoxaparin sodium and neuraxial procedures is not known. Monitor patients frequently for neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider risks/benefits before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. Enoxaparin is used for several days after hip or knee replacement surgery, and in some cases following abdominal surgery, while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form. Enoxaparin is also used if you are unable to get out of bed because of a serious illness. In addition, enoxaparin is used to prevent blood clots from forming in the arteries of the heart during certain types of chest pain and heart attacks.</p><p>Enoxaparin is used together with warfarin to treat acute deep vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism. It is also used to treat certain types of acute heart attacks.</p><p>Enoxaparin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using enoxaparin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For enoxaparin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to enoxaparin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of enoxaparin in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of enoxaparin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have bleeding problems and age-related kidney disease, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving enoxaparin, especially those who weigh less than 45 kilograms (99 lb).</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking enoxaparin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using enoxaparin with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
<li>Defibrotide</li>
</ul><p>Using enoxaparin with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of enoxaparin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will usually give you enoxaparin in the hospital. Enoxaparin is given as a shot under your skin.</p><p>If you are using enoxaparin at home, your doctor will teach you how to inject yourself with the medicine. Be sure to follow the directions carefully. Check with your doctor if you have any problems using the medicine.</p><p>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections.</p><p>If the medicine in the prefilled syringe has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of enoxaparin will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of enoxaparin. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Blood tests will be needed to check for unwanted effects. Be sure to keep all appointments.</p><p>You may bleed or bruise more easily while you are using enoxaparin. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut , or injured. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers. Avoid nose picking and forceful nose blowing.</p><p>Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using enoxaparin. You may need to stop using enoxaparin several days before having surgery or medical tests.</p><p>Enoxaparin may cause bleeding problems. This risk is higher if you have a catheter in your back for pain medicine or anesthesia (sometimes called an "epidural"), or if you have kidney problems. The risk of bleeding increases if your kidney problems get worse. Check with your doctor right away if you have any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; bleeding gums; blood in the urine or stools; tingling, numbness, or weakness of the lower legs; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</p><p>Enoxaparin may increase your chance of bleeding or bruising. Check with your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in the urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin. Avoid picking your nose. If you need to blow your nose, blow it gently.</p><p>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</p><p>Make sure your doctor knows if you have received enoxaparin or heparin before and had a reaction called thrombocytopenia (low platelet count in the blood), or if new blood clots formed while you were receiving the medicine.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have recently given birth, fallen or suffered a blow to the body or head, or had medical or dental surgery. These events may increase the risk of serious bleeding while you are taking enoxaparin.</p><p>Lovenox® multiple-dose vials contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or have had an allergic reaction to benzyl alcohol.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
