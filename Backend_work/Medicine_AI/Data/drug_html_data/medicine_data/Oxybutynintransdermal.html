Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Do not take by mouth.  oxybutynin is for use only on the skin.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Each packet of oxybutynin gel is for one use only. Cover the gel-treated skin with clothing to help prevent getting this medicine on your other skin or on other people.</p><p>Avoid being in water or exercising vigorously for at least 1 hour after applying oxybutynin gel. You may leave a skin patch on while bathing, showering, or swimming.</p><p>Do not wear more than one <b>skin patch</b> at a time. Using extra skin patches will not make the medicine more effective. Never cut a skin patch.</p><p>Cover the gel-treated skin with clothing to help prevent getting this medicine on your other skin or on other people.</p><p>Store this medicine at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep each <b>skin patch</b> in its sealed pouch until you are ready to use it.</p><p>Oxybutynin <b>gel</b> is flammable. Avoid using near open flame, and do not smoke until the gel has completely dried on your skin.</p><p>Throw away an empty gel packet or used skin patch in a place where children and pets cannot get to it. Fold the used skin patch in half so it sticks together.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Apply the gel as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not apply two doses at one time.</p><p>If you forget to change a skin patch on your scheduled day, replace the patch as soon as you remember. Wear the new patch until your next regular patch-changing day. Do not apply two patches at the same time and do not change your patch-changing schedule.</p><p>If a patch falls off, try sticking back into place. If it does not stick well, put on a new patch and leave it on only for the rest of your wearing time. Do not change your patch removal schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include warmth, tingling, fever, irregular heartbeats, feeling restless, vomiting, and little or no urinating.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using oxybutynin transdermal?</h2><p>Do not expose the oxybutynin <b>skin patch</b> to sunlight.

If contact does occur, rinse with water.</p><p>Avoid applying lotions, powders, or oils to the skin you plan to treat with oxybutynin transdermal.
