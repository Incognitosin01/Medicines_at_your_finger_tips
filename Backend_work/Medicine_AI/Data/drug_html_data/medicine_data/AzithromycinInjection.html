</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Azithromycin Injection</h2><p class="First">Azithromycin for injection is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below.</p><h3>Community-Acquired Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Due to <span class="Italics">Chlamydophila pneumoniae</span>, <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span>, <span class="Italics">Legionella pneumophila</span>, <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span>, <span class="Italics">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</span>, <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, or <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> in patients who require initial intravenous therapy.</p><h3>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease</h3><p class="First">Due to <span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span>, <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span>, or <span class="Italics">Mycoplasma hominis</span> in patients who require initial intravenous therapy. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with azithromycin for injection.</p><p>Azithromycin for injection should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route as required. <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span></p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin for injection and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin for injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Azithromycin Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><h3>Community-Acquired Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to the indicated organisms is 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for at least two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 500 mg, administered as two 250 mg tablets to complete a 7- to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.</p><h3>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of azithromycin for injection for the treatment of adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease due to the indicated organisms is 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for one or two days. Intravenous therapy should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route at a single, daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be done at the discretion of the physician and in accordance with clinical response.</p><h3>Preparation of the Solution for Intravenous Administration</h3><p class="First">The infusate concentration and rate of infusion for azithromycin for injection should be either 1 mg/mL over 3 hr or 2 mg/mL over 1 hr. Azithromycin for injection should not be given as a bolus or as an intramuscular injection.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Reconstitution</span></span></p><p>Prepare the initial solution of Azithromycin for Injection by adding 4.8 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to the 500 mg vial, and shaking the vial until all of the drug is dissolved. Since azithromycin for injection is supplied under vacuum, it is recommended that a standard 5 mL (non-automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount of 4.8 mL of Sterile Water is dispensed. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 100 mg azithromycin. Reconstituted solution is stable for 24 hr when stored below 30°C (86°F).</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. If particulate matter is evident in reconstituted fluids, the drug solution should be discarded.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dilute this solution further prior to administration as instructed below.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dilution</span></p><p>To provide azithromycin over a concentration range of 1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL, transfer 5 mL of the 100 mg/mL azithromycin solution into the appropriate amount of any of the diluents listed below:</p><p>Normal Saline (0.9% sodium chloride)</p><p>1/2 Normal Saline (0.45% sodium chloride)</p><p>5% Dextrose in Water</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s Solution</p><p>5% Dextrose in 1/2 Normal Saline (0.45% sodium chloride) with 20 mEq KCl</p><p>5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer’s Solution</p><p>5% Dextrose in 1/3 Normal Saline (0.3% sodium chloride)</p><p>5% Dextrose in 1/2 Normal Saline (0.45% sodium chloride)</p><p>Normosol<span class="Sup">®</span>-M in 5% Dextrose</p><p>Normosol<span class="Sup">®</span>-R in 5% Dextrose</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Final Infusion Solution Concentration (mg/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Amount of Diluent (mL)</span></p><p class="First">1 mg/mL</p><p class="First">500 mL</p><p class="First">2 mg/mL</p><p class="First">250 mL</p><p>Other intravenous substances, additives, or medications should not be added to azithromycin for injection, or infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line.</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>When diluted according to the instructions (1 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL), azithromycin for injection is stable for 24 hr at or below room temperature 30°C (86°F), or for 7 days if stored under refrigeration 5°C (41°F).</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Azithromycin for injection, USP is supplied as white lyophilized cake or powder in a 10 mL vial equivalent to 500 mg of azithromycin for intravenous administration.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to azithromycin, erythromycin, any macrolide or ketolide drugs.</p><h3>Hepatic Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of azithromycin.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy. <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)]</span></p><p>Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is unknown at present.</p><p>If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that the allergic symptoms may reappear after symptomatic therapy has been discontinued.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.</p><h3>Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)</h3><p class="First">Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.</p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation, which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including azithromycin for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued.</p><p>Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Exacerbations of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy.</p><h3>Infusion Site Reactions</h3><p class="First">Azithromycin for injection should be reconstituted and diluted as directed and administered as an intravenous infusion over not less than 60 minutes. <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span></p><p>Local IV site reactions have been reported with the intravenous administration of azithromycin. The incidence and severity of these reactions were the same when 500 mg azithromycin was given over 1 hour (2 mg/mL as 250 mL infusion) or over 3 hr (1 mg/mL as 500 mL infusion) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)].</span> All volunteers who received infusate concentrations above 2.0 mg/mL experienced local IV site reactions and, therefore, higher concentrations should be avoided.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing azithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In clinical trials of intravenous azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia, in which 2 to 5 IV doses were given, the reported adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. The majority of patients in these trials had one or more co-morbid diseases and were receiving concomitant medications. Approximately 1.2% of the patients discontinued intravenous azithromycin therapy, and a total of 2.4% discontinued azithromycin therapy by either the intravenous or oral route because of clinical or laboratory side effects.</p><p>In clinical trials conducted in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease, in which 1 to 2 IV doses were given, 2% of women who received monotherapy with azithromycin and 4% who received azithromycin plus metronidazole discontinued therapy due to clinical side effects.</p><p>Clinical adverse reactions leading to discontinuations from these studies were gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and rashes; laboratory side effects leading to discontinuation were increases in transaminase levels and/or alkaline phosphatase levels.</p><p>Overall, the most common adverse reactions associated with treatment in adult patients who received IV/Oral azithromycin in studies of community-acquired pneumonia were related to the gastrointestinal system with diarrhea/loose stools (4.3%), nausea (3.9%), abdominal pain (2.7%), and vomiting (1.4%) being the most frequently reported.</p><p>Approximately 12% of patients experienced a side effect related to the intravenous infusion; most common were pain at the injection site (6.5%) and local inflammation (3.1%).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions associated with treatment in adult women who received IV/Oral azithromycin in trials of pelvic inflammatory disease were related to the gastrointestinal system. Diarrhea (8.5%) and nausea (6.6%) were most commonly reported, followed by vaginitis (2.8%), abdominal pain (1.9%), anorexia (1.9%), rash and pruritus (1.9%). When azithromycin was co-administered with metronidazole in these trials, a higher proportion of women experienced adverse reactions of nausea (10.3%), abdominal pain (3.7%), vomiting (2.8%), infusion site reaction, stomatitis, dizziness, or dyspnea (all at 1.9%).</p><p>Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of 1% or less included the following:</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> Dyspepsia, flatulence, mucositis, oral moniliasis, and gastritis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system:</span> Headache, somnolence.</p><p><span class="Italics">Allergic:</span> Bronchospasm.</p><p><span class="Italics">Special senses:</span> Taste perversion.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of azithromycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported with azithromycin during the postmarketing period in adult and/or pediatric patients for which a causal relationship may not be established include:</p><p><span class="Italics">Allergic:</span> Arthralgia, edema, urticaria and angioedema.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and hypotension. There have been reports of QT prolongation and <span class="Italics">torsades de pointes</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> Anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting/diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, oral candidiasis, pyloric stenosis, and reports of tongue discoloration.</p><p><span class="Italics">General:</span> Asthenia, paresthesia, fatigue, malaise and anaphylaxis (including fatalities).</p><p><span class="Italics">Genitourinary:</span> Interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure and vaginitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematopoietic:</span> Thrombocytopenia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Liver/biliary:</span> Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system:</span> Convulsions, dizziness/vertigo, headache, somnolence, hyperactivity, nervousness, agitation and syncope.</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric:</span> Aggressive reaction and anxiety.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin/appendages:</span> Pruritus, serious skin reactions including, erythema multiforme, AGEP, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS.</p><p><span class="Italics">Special senses:</span> Hearing disturbances including hearing loss, deafness and/or tinnitus and reports of taste/smell perversion and/or loss.</p><h3>Laboratory Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows:</p><p>When follow-up was provided, changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible.</p><p>In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 750 patients treated with azithromycin (IV/Oral), less than 2% of patients discontinued azithromycin therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Nelfinavir</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of nelfinavir at steady-state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations. Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted. <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)]</span></p><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly.</p><h3>Potential Drug-Drug Interaction with Macrolides</h3><p class="First">Interactions with digoxin, colchicine or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin. No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction. However, drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin, colchicine or phenytoin are used with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience over several decades with azithromycin use in pregnant women have not identified any drug-associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> Developmental toxicity studies with azithromycin in rats, mice, and rabbits showed no drug-induced fetal malformations at doses up to 4, 2, and 2 times, respectively, an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area. Decreased viability and delayed development were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered azithromycin from day 6 of pregnancy through weaning at a dose equivalent to 4 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with azithromycin use in pregnant women. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been conducted using IV administration of azithromycin to animals. Azithromycin administered during the period of organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations in rats and mice at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (moderately maternally toxic). Based on body surface area, this dose is approximately 4 (rats) and 2 (mice) times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg. In rabbits administered azithromycin at oral doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day during organogenesis, reduced maternal body weight and food consumption were observed in all groups; no evidence of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed at these doses, the highest of which is estimated to be 2 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area.</p><p>In a pre- and postnatal development study, azithromycin was administered orally to pregnant rats from day 6 of pregnancy until weaning at doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity (reduced food consumption and body weight gain; increased stress at parturition) was observed at the higher dose. Effects in the offspring were noted at 200 mg/kg/day during the postnatal development period (decreased viability, delayed developmental landmarks). These effects were not observed in a pre- and postnatal rat study when up to 200 mg/kg/day of azithromycin was given orally beginning on day 15 of pregnancy until weaning.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Azithromycin is present in human milk <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Non-serious adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants after maternal administration of azithromycin <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. There are no available data on the effects of azithromycin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for azithromycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azithromycin or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Advise women to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea, vomiting, or rash.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Azithromycin breastmilk concentrations were measured in 20 women after receiving a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin during labor. Breastmilk samples collected on days 3 and 6 postpartum as well as 2 and 4 weeks postpartum revealed the presence of azithromycin in breastmilk up to 4 weeks after dosing. In another study, a single dose of azithromycin 500 mg was administered intravenously to 8 women prior to incision for cesarean section. Breastmilk (colostrum) samples obtained between 12 and 48 hours after dosing revealed that azithromycin persisted in breastmilk up to 48 hours.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established. In controlled clinical studies, azithromycin has been administered to pediatric patients (age 6 months to 16 years) by the oral route. For information regarding the use of azithromycin for oral suspension in the treatment of pediatric patients, <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1),</span> and <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2)]</span> of the prescribing information for azithromycin for oral suspension 100 mg/5 mL and 200 mg/5 mL bottles.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies with intravenous azithromycin have not been performed in older volunteers. Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin following oral administration in older volunteers (65 to 85 years old) were similar to those in younger volunteers (18 to 40 years old) for the 5-day therapeutic regimen.</p><p>In multiple-dose clinical trials of intravenous azithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, 45% of patients (188/414) were at least 65 years of age and 22% of patients (91/414) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects in terms of adverse reactions, laboratory abnormalities, and discontinuations. Similar decreases in clinical response were noted in azithromycin-and comparator-treated patients with increasing age.</p><p>Azithromycin for injection contains 113.47 mg (4.93 mEq) of sodium per vial. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive 113.47 mg (4.93 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. The total sodium content from dietary and non-dietary sources may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure.</p><p>Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions experienced in higher than recommended doses were similar to those seen at normal doses particularly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures are indicated as required.</p><h2>Azithromycin Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Azithromycin for injection, USP contains the active ingredient azithromycin, an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibacterial drug, for intravenous injection. Azithromycin has the chemical name <span class="Italics">(2R,3S,4R,5R,8R,10R,11R,12S,13S,14R)</span>-13[(2,6-dideoxy-3-<span class="Italics">C</span>-methyl-3-<span class="Italics">O</span>-methyl-α-<span class="Italics">L-ribo</span>-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-2-ethyl-3,4,10-trihydroxy-3,5,6,8,10,12,14-hepta-methyl-11[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethylamino)-β-<span class="Italics">D</span>-<span class="Italics">xylo</span>-hexopyranosyl]oxy]-1-oxa-6-azacyclopentadecan-15-one. Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin; however, it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">38</span>H<span class="Sub">72</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">12</span>, and its molecular weight is 749.00.

Azithromycin for injection, USP is supplied as white lyophilized cake or powder in a 10 mL vial equivalent to 500 mg of azithromycin for intravenous administration. Reconstitution, according to label directions, results in approximately 5 mL of azithromycin for intravenous injection with each mL containing azithromycin monohydrate, USP equivalent to 100 mg of azithromycin.</p><h2>Azithromycin Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span></p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens (<span class="Italics">S. pneumoniae and S. aureus</span>). The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></span></p><p>QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner.

Azithromycin has shown no mutagenic potential in standard laboratory tests: mouse lymphoma assay, human lymphocyte clastogenic assay, and mouse bone marrow clastogenic assay. In fertility studies conducted in male and female rats, oral administration of azithromycin for 64 to 66 days (males) or 15 days (females) prior to and during cohabitation resulted in decreased pregnancy rate at 20 and 30 mg/kg/day when both males and females were treated with azithromycin. This minimal effect on pregnancy rate (approximately 12% reduction compared to concurrent controls) did not become more pronounced when the dose was increased from 20 to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4 to 0.6 times the adult daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area) and it was not observed when only one animal in the mated pair was treated. There were no effects on any other reproductive parameters, and there were no effects on fertility at 10 mg/kg/day. The relevance of these findings to patients being treated with azithromycin at the doses and durations recommended in the prescribing information is uncertain.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Phospholipidosis (intracellular phospholipid accumulation) has been observed in some tissues of mice, rats, and dogs given multiple oral doses of azithromycin. It has been demonstrated in numerous organ systems (e.g., eye, dorsal root ganglia, liver, gallbladder, kidney, spleen, and/or pancreas) in dogs and rats treated with azithromycin at doses which, expressed on the basis of body surface area, are similar to or less than the highest recommended adult human dose. This effect has been shown to be reversible after cessation of azithromycin treatment. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, phospholipidosis has been seen in the rat (50 mg/kg/day dose) at the observed maximal plasma concentration of 1.3 mcg/mL (1.6 times the observed C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 0.821 mcg/mL at the adult dose of 2 g.) Similarly, it has been shown in the dog (10 mg/kg/day dose) at the observed maximal serum concentration of 1 mcg/mL (1.2 times the observed C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 0.821 mcg/mL at the adult dose of 2 g).</p><p>Phospholipidosis was also observed in neonatal rats dosed for 18 days at 30 mg/kg/day, which is less than the pediatric dose of 60 mg/kg based on body surface area. It was not observed in neonatal rats treated for 10 days at 40 mg/kg/day with mean maximal serum concentrations of 1.86 mcg/mL, approximately 1.5 times the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 1.27 mcg/mL at the pediatric dose. Phospholipidosis has been observed in neonatal dogs (10 mg/kg/day) at maximum mean whole blood concentrations of 3.54 mcg/mL, approximately 3 times the pediatric dose C<span class="Sub">max</span>. The significance of the findings for animals and for humans is unknown.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Community-Acquired Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia performed in the U.S., azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2250 mg/day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days followed by 1000 mg/day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates, i.e., cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) among the 277 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Outcome</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Azithromycin</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Comparator</span></p><p class="First">Cure</p><p class="First">46%</p><p class="First">44%</p><p class="First">Improved</p><p class="First">32%</p><p class="First">30%</p><p class="First">Success (Cure + Improved)</p><p class="First">78%</p><p class="First">74%</p><p>In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial performed in the U.S., 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin in the same regimen were evaluable for clinical efficacy.
