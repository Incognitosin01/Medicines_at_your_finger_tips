<span class="Bold">INTRAVAGINAL USE.</span></p><h2>Renova Cream Description</h2><p class="First">RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream) 0.02% contains the active ingredient tretinoin in a cream base. Tretinoin is a yellow to light-orange crystalline powder having a characteristic floral odor. Tretinoin is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, slightly soluble in polyethylene glycol 400, octanol, and 100% ethanol. It is practically insoluble in water and mineral oil, and it is insoluble in glycerin. The chemical name for tretinoin is (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. Tretinoin is also referred to as all-trans-retinoic acid and has a molecular weight of 300.44. The structural formula is represented below:</p><p>Tretinoin is available as RENOVA at a concentration of 0.02% w/w in an oil-in-water emulsion formulation consisting of benzyl alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene, caprylic/capric triglyceride, cetyl alcohol, edetate disodium, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, steareth 2, steareth 20, and xanthan gum.</p><h2>Renova Cream - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Tretinoin is an endogenous retinoid metabolite of Vitamin A that binds to intracellular receptors in the cytosol and nucleus, but cutaneous levels of tretinoin in excess of physiologic concentrations occur following application of a tretinoin-containing topical drug product. Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) which may act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms such as irritation, or both.</p><p>The effect of tretinoin on skin with chronic photodamage has not been evaluated in animal studies. When hairless albino mice were treated topically with tretinoin shortly after a period of UVB irradiation, new collagen formation was demonstrated only in photodamaged skin. However, in human skin treated topically, adequate data have not been provided to demonstrate any increase in desmosine, hydroxyproline, or elastin mRNA. Application of 0.1% tretinoin cream to photodamaged human forearm skin was associated with an increase in antibody staining for procollagen I propeptide. No correlation was made between procollagen I propeptide staining with collagen I levels or with observed clinical effects. Thus, the relationships between the increased collagen in rodents, increased procollagen I propeptide in humans, and the clinical effects of tretinoin have not yet been clearly defined.</p><p>Tretinoin was shown to enhance UV-stimulated melanogenesis in pigmented mice. Generalized amyloid deposition in the basal layer of tretinoin-treated skin was noted in a 2-year mouse study. In a different study, hyalinization at tretinoin-treated skin sites was noted at doses beginning at 0.25 mg/kg in CD-1 mice.</p><p>The transdermal absorption of tretinoin from various topical formulations ranged from 1% to 31% of applied dose, depending on whether it was applied to healthy skin or dermatitic skin. No percutaneous absorption study was conducted with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% in human volunteers. When percutaneous absorption of the oil-in-water emulsion formulation at 0.05% concentration was assessed in healthy male subjects with radiolabeled cream after a single application (n=7), as well as after repeated daily applications (n=7) for 28 days, the absorption of tretinoin was less than 2% and the extent of bioavailability was less after repeated application. No significant difference in endogenous concentrations of tretinoin was observed between single and repeated daily applications.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Renova Cream</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(To understand fully the indication for this product, please read the entire INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the labeling.)</span></p><p>RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% is indicated as an adjunctive agent (see second bullet point below) for use in the mitigation (palliation) of <span class="Bold">fine</span> facial wrinkles in patients who use comprehensive skin care and sunlight avoidance programs. <span class="Bold">RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% DOES NOT ELIMINATE WRINKLES, REPAIR SUN-DAMAGED SKIN, REVERSE PHOTOAGING, or RESTORE MORE YOUTHFUL or YOUNGER SKIN.</span> In double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical studies, many patients in the vehicle group achieved desired palliative effects on fine wrinkling of facial skin with the use of comprehensive skin care and sunlight avoidance programs including sunscreens, protective clothing, and non-prescription emollient creams.</p><h3>Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">Four adequate and well-controlled multi-center trials and one single-center randomized, controlled trial were conducted involving a total of 324 evaluable patients treated with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% and 332 evaluable patients treated with the vehicle cream on the face for 24 weeks with a comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance program, to assess the effects on fine and coarse wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, tactile skin roughness, and laxity. Patients were evaluated at baseline on a 10-unit scale and changes from that baseline rating were categorized as follows:</p><p class="First">Worsening:</p><p class="First">Increase of 1 unit or more.</p><p class="First">No improvement:</p><p class="First">No change.</p><p class="First">Minimal improvement:</p><p class="First">Reduction of 1 unit.</p><p class="First">Mild improvement:</p><p class="First">Reduction of 2 units.</p><p class="First">Moderate improvement:</p><p class="First">Reduction of 3 units or more.</p><p>In these trials, the fine and coarse wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, tactile roughness, and laxity of the facial skin were thought to be caused by multiple factors which included intrinsic aging or environmental factors, such as chronic sunlight exposure.</p><p>Two of the five trials provided adequate demonstration of efficacy for mitigation of fine facial wrinkling. No two of the five trials adequately demonstrated efficacy for mitigation of coarse wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, tactile skin roughness, and laxity. Data for fine wrinkling (the indication for which RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% demonstrated efficacy) from all five trials (four studies in lightly pigmented subjects with Fitzpatrick Skin Types I-III and one study in darkly pigmented subjects with Fitzpatrick Skin Types IV-VI) is provided below:</p><p class="First">Worsened</p><p class="First">1%</p><p class="First">3%</p><p class="First">No Change</p><p class="First">40%</p><p class="First">58%</p><p class="First">Minimal Improvement</p><p class="First">35%</p><p class="First">27%</p><p class="First">Mild Improvement</p><p class="First">15%</p><p class="First">9%</p><p class="First">Moderate Improvement</p><p class="First">10%</p><p class="First">3%</p><p>Self-assessment of fine wrinkles after 24 weeks of treatment with either RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% or Vehicle from the four studies in lightly pigmented patients showed the following:</p><p>No studies have been conducted comparing the facial irritation or efficacy of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% to RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.05% (older marketed formulation).</p><p>Patients may lose some of the mitigating effects of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% after 12 weeks of discontinuation of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% from their comprehensive skin care and sunlight avoidance program.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in individuals with a history of sensitivity reactions to any of its components. It should be discontinued if hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients is noted.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimized during use of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% because of heightened sunburn susceptibility. Patients should be warned to use sunscreens (minimum SPF of 15) and protective clothing when using RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02%. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure, e.g., due to their occupation, and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise caution when using RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% and follow the precautions outlined in the Patient Package Insert.</p><p>RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% should be kept out of the eyes, mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may cause severe local erythema, pruritus, burning, stinging, and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use less medication, decrease the frequency of application, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether and consider additional appropriate therapy.</p><p>Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used only with caution in patients with this condition.</p><p>Application of larger amounts of medication than recommended has not been shown to lead to more rapid or better results, and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General:</h3><p class="First">RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% should be used only as an adjunct to a comprehensive skin care and sunlight avoidance program (see <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span>).</p><p>If a drug sensitivity, chemical irritation, or a systemic adverse reaction develops, use of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% should be discontinued. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tretinoin-containing products.</p><h3>Information for Patients:</h3><p class="First">RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% is to be used as described below unless otherwise directed by your physician:</p><p>Please refer to the Patient Package Insert for additional patient information.</p><h3>Drug Interactions:</h3><p class="First">Concomitant topical medications, medicated or abrasive soaps, shampoos, cleansers, cosmetics with a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime, permanent wave solutions, electrolysis, hair depilatories or waxes, and products that may irritate the skin should be used with caution in patients being treated with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% because they may increase irritation with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02%.</p><p>RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% should not be administered if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the possibility of augmented phototoxicity.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h3><p class="First">In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. These concentrations are near the tretinoin concentration of this clinical formulation (0.02%). A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day. These doses are 10 and 20 times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.5 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.004 mg tretinoin/kg body weight).</p><p>Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources.</p><p>The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative.</p><p>In dermal Segment I fertility studies in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (10 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (83 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area).</p><h3>Pregnancy:</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ORAL tretinoin</span> has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (42 times the maximum human systemic dose normalized for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which, metabolically, is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (417 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques.</p><p><span class="Bold">TOPICAL tretinoin</span> in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (42 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was dermally applied.</p><p>There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (17 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species.</p><p>In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overtly teratogenic, in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (42 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species).</p><p>With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin (Retin-A<span class="Sup">®</span>). Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Non-teratogenic Effects</span></p><p>Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (42 times the maximum human systemic dose normalized for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death, in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (104 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area).</p><p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% should not be used during pregnancy.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers:</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, mitigation of fine facial wrinkles with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% may be postponed in nursing mothers until after completion of the nursing period.</p><h3>Pediatric Use:</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use:</h3><p class="First">In clinical studies with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02%, patients aged 65 to 71 did not demonstrate a significant difference for improvement in fine wrinkling when compared to patients under the age of 65. Patients aged 65 and over may demonstrate slightly more irritation, although the differences were not statistically significant in the clinical studies for RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02%. Safety and effectiveness of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% in individuals older than 71 years of age have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">(See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.)</p><p>In double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies involving 339 patients who applied RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% to their faces, adverse reactions associated with the use of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% were limited primarily to the skin. Almost all patients reported one or more local reactions such as peeling, dry skin, burning, stinging, erythema, and pruritus. In 32% of all study patients, skin irritation was reported that was severe, led to temporary discontinuation of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02%, or led to use of a mild topical corticosteroid. About 7% of patients using RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02%, compared to less than 1% of the control patients, had sufficiently severe local irritation to warrant short-term use of mild topical corticosteroids to alleviate local irritation. About 4% of patients had to discontinue use of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% because of adverse reactions.</p><p>Approximately 2% of spontaneous postmarketing adverse event reporting for RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.05% were for skin hypo- or hyperpigmentation. Other spontaneously reported adverse events for RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.05% predominantly appear to be local reactions similar to those seen in clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bausch Health US, LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Application of larger amounts of medication than recommended has not been shown to lead to more rapid or better results, and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur. Oral ingestion of the drug may lead to the same side effects as those associated with excessive oral intake of Vitamin A.</p><h2>Renova Cream Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Patients require detailed instruction to obtain maximal benefits and to understand all the precautions necessary to use this product with greatest safety. The physician should review the Patient Package Insert.</p><p>RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% should be applied to the face once a day in the evening, using only enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Patients should gently wash their faces with a mild soap, pat the skin dry, and wait 20 to 30 minutes before applying RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02%. The patient should apply a <span class="Bold">small pearl-sized (about ¼ inch or 5 mm diameter) amount</span> of cream to cover the entire affected area lightly. Caution should be taken when applying the cream to avoid the eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth.</p><p>Application of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging.</p><p>Mitigation (palliation) of fine facial wrinkling may occur gradually over the course of therapy. Up to 6 months of therapy may be required before the effects are seen.</p><p>With discontinuation of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% therapy, some patients may lose the mitigating effects of RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% on fine facial wrinkles. <span class="Bold">The safety and effectiveness of using RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% daily for greater than 52 weeks have <span class="Bold">not</span> been established.</span></p><p>Application of larger amounts of medication than recommended may not lead to more rapid or better results, and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur.</p><p>Patients treated with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% may use cosmetics but the areas to be treated should be cleansed before the medication is applied (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><h2>How is Renova Cream Supplied</h2><p class="First">RENOVA<span class="Sup">®</span> (tretinoin cream), 0.02% is available in tubes containing 20 grams (NDC 0187-5150-20), 40 grams (NDC 0187-5150-40), 60 grams (NDC 0187-5150-60), and in pumps containing 44 grams (NDC 0187-5150-44).</p><h3>Storage:</h3><p class="First">Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F).</p><h2>QUESTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Physicians and Pharmacists can call 1-800-321-4576, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Manufactured for:</span><br/>
