Symptoms included malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs, age greater than 65 years old, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue use and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

Saxagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by making the pancreas gland release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar when there is too much sugar in the blood. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better. Saxagliptin and metformin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Saxagliptin and metformin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using saxagliptin and metformin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For saxagliptin and metformin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to saxagliptin and metformin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of saxagliptin and metformin combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of saxagliptin and metformin combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution for patients receiving saxagliptin and metformin. Saxagliptin and metformin is not recommended in patients 80 years of age and older who have kidney problems.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking saxagliptin and metformin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using saxagliptin and metformin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
