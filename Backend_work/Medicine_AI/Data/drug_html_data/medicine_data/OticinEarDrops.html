It provides temporary relief from itching and pain by stabilizing the neuronal membranes of nerve endings with which it comes into contact.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Oticin Ear Drops</h2><p class="First">For the treatment of superficial infections of the external ear caused by microbes and to control the accompanying itching.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This medication is contraindicated in patients sensitive to any of the components of this preparation.

If irritation or sensitization occurs, promptly discontinue use of this preparation and institute other measures.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Treatment should not be continued for longer than ten days and the source of infection and/or inflammation or sensitization evaluated to determine whether therapy should be changed.</p><p>Information for Patients: Patients using this medication should be advised of the following:</p><p>• This medication is to be used as directed by a physician.</p><p>• Do not use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed.

Oticin Ear Drops should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h2>Oticin Ear Drops Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The external ear that is the auricle and the auditory canal should be thoroughly cleansed and dried. Four (4) to five (5) drops of Oticin Ear Drops should be instilled into the affected ear 3 to 4 times daily. For infants and small children, 3 drops are suggested because of the smaller capacity of the ear canal. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward to instill the drops and this position maintained for at least 5 minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary for the opposite affected ear. If preferred, a gauze ear plug or wick may be inserted into the ear canal prior to applying Oticin Ear Drops. When using a wick, a few drops of sterile water should be applied directly to the wick following insertion to facilitate hydration. It should then be saturated with Oticin Ear Drops. The patient should be instructed to add a few drops of Oticin Ear Drops to the wick every four hours, and to remove the wick after 24 hours. Five (5) drops of Oticin Ear Drops should continue to be instilled 3 or 4 times daily thereafter. When using a gauze earplug, the external ear canal is first treated with drops of Oticin Ear Drops. Next, the gauze is inserted into the ear canal to contain medication. The gauze ear plug or the expanded wick are easily removed by fingers, forceps, or tweezers. This product may continue to be used in the unaffected ear 3 times daily as a preventative.</p><h2>How is Oticin Ear Drops Supplied</h2><p class="First">Oticin Ear Drops are supplied as a clear liquid in plastic dropper vials of 10 mL, NDC 68436-115-10.</p><p><span class="Bold">KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.
