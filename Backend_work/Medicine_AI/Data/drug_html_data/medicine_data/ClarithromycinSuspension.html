</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Clarithromycin Suspension</h2><h3>Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is indicated in adults for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span>, <span class="Italics">Haemophilus parainfluenzae</span>, <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span>, or <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> [see <span class="Italics">I</span><span class="Italics">ndications and Usage (1.9)</span>].</p><h3>Acute Maxillary Sinusitis</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span>, <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span>, or <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> [see <span class="Italics">Indications and Usage (1.9)</span>].</p><h3>Community-Acquired Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is indicated [see <span class="Italics">Indications and Usage (1.9)</span>]for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to:</p><h3>Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> as an alternative in individuals who cannot use first line therapy.</p><h3>Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, or <span class="Italics">S</span><span class="Italics">treptococcus pyogenes</span>.</p><h3>Acute Otitis Media</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is indicated in pediatric patients for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span>, <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span>, or <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.2)</span>].</p><h3>Treatment and Prophylaxis of Disseminated Mycobacterial Infections</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates due to <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> or <span class="Italics">Myc</span><span class="Italics">obacterium intracellulare</span> in patients with advanced HIV infection [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.1</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clarithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, clarithromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Clarithromycin Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin for oral suspension may be given with or without food.</p><h3>Pediatric Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended daily dosage is 15 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours for 10 days (up to the adult dose). Refer to dosage regimens for mycobacterial infections in pediatric patients for additional dosage information [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.5)</span>].</p><h3>Dosage Regimens for Mycobacterial Infections</h3><p class="First">For the treatment of disseminated infection due to <span class="Italics">Myc</span><span class="Italics">obacterium avium</span> complex (MAC), clarithromycin is recommended as the primary agents. Clarithromycin should be used in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs (e.g. ethambutol) that have shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> activity against MAC or clinical benefit in MAC treatment [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.1</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adult Patients</span></span></p><p>For treatment and prophylaxis of mycobacterial infections in adults, the recommended dose of clarithromycin is 500 mg every 12 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></span></p><p>For treatment and prophylaxis of mycobacterial infections in pediatric patients, the recommended dose is 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours up to 500 mg every 12 hours. [see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.1</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Clarithromycin therapy should continue if clinical response is observed. Clarithromycin can be discontinued when the patient is considered at low risk of disseminated infection.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">Table 2</span> for dosage adjustment in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment with or without concomitant atazanavir or ritonavir-containing regimens [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2.</span> Clarithromycin <span class="Bold">Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><h3>Dosage Adjustment Due to Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Decrease the dose of clarithromycin by 50 % when co-administered with atazanavir [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Dosage adjustments for other drugs when co-administered with clarithromycin may be recommended due to drug interactions [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><h3>Reconstitution of Clarithromycin for Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">The supplied clarithromycin granules must be reconstituted with water prior to administration of clarithromycin for oral suspension. <span class="Bold">Table 3</span> below indicates the volume of water to be added when reconstituting. To reconstitute:</p><p>Shake well before each use. After mixing, store at 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) and use within</p><p>14 days. Do not refrigerate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3.

Fatalities have been reported.</p><h3>Cholestatic Jaundice/Hepatic Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin.</p><h3>Colchicine</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.</p><h3>Lomitapide, Lovastatin, and Simvastatin</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with lomitapide is contraindicated due to potential for markedly increased transaminases [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.4</span><span class="Italics">)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><p>Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 (lovastatin or simvastatin) is contraindicated, due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Ergot Alkaloids</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><h3>Contraindications for Co-administered Drugs</h3><p class="First">For information about contraindications of other drugs indicated in combination with clarithromycin, refer to their full prescribing information (contraindications section).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">In the event of severe acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, discontinue clarithromycin therapy immediately and institute appropriate treatment.</p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Avoid clarithromycin in the following patients:</p><p>Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval [see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.5)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In some instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. Symptoms of hepatitis can include anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen. Discontinue clarithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.</p><h3>Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Concomitant Use with Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4:</span></span> Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; markedly increased transaminases with lomitapide; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; hypoglycemia and cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., <span class="Italics">torsades de pointes</span>) with disopyramide; and hypotension and acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine). Most reports of acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 involved elderly patients 65 years of age or older. Use clarithromycin with caution when administered concurrently with medications that induce the cytochrome CYP3A4 enzyme. The use of clarithromycin with lomitapide, simvastatin, lovastatin, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4.5,</span> <span class="Italics">4.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Colchicine:</span></span> Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If co-administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, reduce the dose of colchicine. Monitor patients for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4.4</span><span class="Italics">)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lomitapide:</span></span> Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lomitapide is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.5)]</span>. Lomitapide is metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases the plasma concentration of lomitapide, which increases the risk of elevation in transaminases <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lomitapide must be suspended during the course of treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins):</span></span> Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4.5</span><span class="Italics">)</span>] as these statins are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases their plasma concentration, which increases the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with these statins. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment.</p><p>Exercise caution when prescribing clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin. In situations where the concomitant use of clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin cannot be avoided, atorvastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily and pravastatin dose should not exceed 40 mg daily. Use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g. fluvastatin) can be considered. It is recommended to prescribe the lowest registered dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Oral Hypoglycemic Agents/Insulin:</span></span> The concomitant use of clarithromycin and oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin can result in significant hypoglycemia. With certain hypoglycemic drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause hypoglycemia when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Quetiapine:</span></span> Use quetiapine and clarithromycin concomitantly with caution. Co-administration could result in increased quetiapine exposure and quetiapine related toxicities such as somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, altered state of consciousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation. Refer to quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on dose reduction if co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Oral Anticoagulants:</span></span> There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in INR and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is co-administered with warfarin. Monitor INR and prothrombin times frequently while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants concurrently [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Benzodiazepines:</span></span> Increased sedation and prolongation of sedation have been reported with concomitant administration of clarithromycin and triazolobenzodiazepines, such as triazolam and midazolam [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7)</span>].</p><h3>All-Cause Mortality in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease 1 to 10 Years after Clarithromycin Exposure</h3><p class="First">In one clinical trial evaluating treatment with clarithromycin on outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease, an increase in risk of all-cause mortality one year or more after the end of treatment was observed in patients randomized to receive clarithromycin.<span class="Sup">1</span> Clarithromycin for treatment of coronary artery disease is not an approved indication. The cause of the increased risk has not been established. Other epidemiologic studies evaluating this risk have shown variable results <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.1)]</span>. Consider balancing this potential risk with the treatment benefits when prescribing clarithromycin in patients who have suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C</span><span class="Italics">. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C</span><span class="Italics">. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C</span><span class="Italics">. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Embryo-fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on findings from animal studies, clarithromycin is not recommended for use in pregnant women except in clinical circumstances where no alternative therapy is appropriate. If clarithromycin is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while the patient is taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Clarithromycin demonstrated adverse effects on pregnancy outcome and/or embryo- fetal development, including fetal malformations, in pregnant animals administered oral clarithromycin [see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin therapy.</p><h3>Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing clarithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Based on pooled data across all indications, the most frequent adverse reactions for both adult and pediatric populations observed in clinical trials are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and dysgeusia. Also reported were dyspepsia, liver function test abnormal, anaphylactic reaction, candidiasis, headache, insomnia, and rash.</p><p>The subsequent subsections list the most common adverse reactions for prophylaxis and treatment of mycobacterial infections and duodenal ulcer associated with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> infection. In general, these profiles are consistent with the pooled data described above.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Prophylaxis of Mycobacterial Infections</span></span></p><p>In AIDS patients treated with clarithromycin over long periods of time for prophylaxis against <span class="Italics">M. avium</span>, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse reactions possibly associated with clarithromycin administration from underlying HIV disease or intercurrent illness. Median duration of treatment was 10.6 months for the clarithromycin group and 8.2 months for the placebo group.</p><p>Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 18% of patients receiving clarithromycin compared to 17% of patients receiving placebo in this trial. Primary reasons for discontinuation in clarithromycin treated patients include headache, nausea, vomiting, depression, and taste perversion.</p><p><span class="Italics">Changes in Laboratory Values</span></p><p>Selected laboratory adverse experiences that were reported during therapy in greater than 2 % of adult patients treated with clarithromycin in a randomized double-blind clinical trial involving 682 patients are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 5</span>.</p><p>In immunocompromised patients receiving prophylaxis against <span class="Italics">M. avium</span>, evaluations of laboratory values were made by analyzing those values outside the seriously abnormal value (i.e., the extreme high or low limit) for the specified test.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5.

In animal reproduction studies, administration of oral clarithromycin to pregnant mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys during the period of organogenesis produced malformations in rats (cardiovascular anomalies) and mice (cleft palate) at clinically relevant doses based on body surface area comparison.

In pregnant mice, clarithromycin was administered during organogenesis (gestation day [GD] 6 to 15) at oral doses of 15, 60, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/day. Reduced body weight observed in dams at 1000 mg/kg/day (3 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] based on body surface area comparison) resulted in reduced survival and body weight of the fetuses. At ≥500 mg/kg/day, increases in the incidence of post-implantation loss and cleft palate in the fetuses were observed. No adverse developmental effects were observed in mice at ≤250 mg/kg/day (≤1 times MRHD based on body surface area comparison).</p><p>In pregnant Sprague Dawley rats, clarithromycin was administered during organogenesis (GD 6 to 15) at oral doses of 15, 50, or 150 mg/kg/day. Reductions in body weight and food consumption was observed in dams at 150 mg/kg/day. Increased resorptions and reduced body weight of the fetuses at this dose were considered secondary to maternal toxicity. Additionally, at 150 mg/kg/day (1 times MRHD based on body surface area comparison), a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies (complete situs inversus, undivided truncus, IV septal defect) was observed in the fetuses. Clarithromycin did not cause adverse developmental effects in rats at 50 mg/kg/day (0.3 times MRHD based on body surface area comparison). Intravenous dosing of clarithromycin during organogenesis in rats (GD 6 to 15) at 15, 50, or 160 mg/kg/day was associated with maternal toxicity (reduced body weight, body-weight gain, and food consumption) at 160 mg/kg/day but no evidence of adverse developmental effects at any dose (≤1 times MRHD based on body surface area comparison).</p><p>In pregnant Wistar rat, clarithromycin was administered during organogenesis (GD 7 to 17) at oral doses of 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg/day.

Intravenously administered clarithromycin to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (GD 6 to 18) in rabbits at 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg/day (≥0.3 times MRHD based on body surface area comparison) resulted in maternal toxicity and implantation losses at all doses.</p><p>In pregnant monkeys, clarithromycin was administered (GD 20 to 50) at oral doses of 35 or 70 mg/kg/day. Dose-dependent emesis, poor appetite, fecal changes, and reduced body weight were observed in dams at all doses (≥0.5 times MRHD based on body surface area comparison). Growth retardation in 1 fetus at 70 mg/kg/day was considered secondary to maternal toxicity. There was no evidence of primary drug related adverse developmental effects at any dose tested.</p><p>In a reproductive toxicology study in rats administered oral clarithromycin late in gestation through lactation (GD 17 to post-natal day 21) at doses of 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg/day (≤1 times MRHD based on body surface area comparison), reductions in maternal body weight and food consumption were observed at 160 mg/kg/day.

Based on the limited data from this study, and assuming milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an exclusively human milk fed infant would receive an estimated average of 136 mcg/kg/day of clarithromycin and its active metabolite, with this maternal dosage regimen. This is less than 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (7.8 mg/kg/day, based on the average maternal weight of 64 kg), and less than 1% of the pediatric dose (15 mg/kg/day) for children greater than 6 months of age.</p><p>A prospective observational study of 55 breastfed infants of mothers taking a macrolide antibacterial (6 were exposed to clarithromycin) were compared to 36 breastfed infants of mothers taking amoxicillin.

These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known age-related decreases in renal function. In clinical trials, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse reactions when compared to younger patients.

Endpoints studied were eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> and duodenal ulcer healing (trials 9 and 10 only). <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> status was determined by CLOtest<span class="Sup">®</span>, histology, and culture in all three trials. For a given patient, <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> was considered eradicated if at least two of these tests were negative, and none was positive.

Do not refrigerate the suspension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Advise patients that clarithromycin may interact with some drugs; therefore, advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medications.</p><p><span class="Bold">Diarrhea</span></p><p>Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials including clarithromycin which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial.

They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clarithromycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clarithromycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>There are no data on the effect of clarithromycin on the ability to drive or use machines. However, counsel patients regarding the potential for dizziness, vertigo, confusion and disorientation, which may occur with the clarithromycin.
