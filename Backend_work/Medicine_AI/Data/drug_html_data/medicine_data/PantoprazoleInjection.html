The frequency of dosing can be adjusted to individual patient needs based on acid output measurements. In those patients who need a higher dosage, 80 mg intravenously every 8 hours is expected to maintain acid output below 10 mEq/h. Daily doses higher than 240 mg or administered for more than 6 days have not been studied <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. Transition from oral to intravenous and from intravenous to oral formulations of gastric acid inhibitors should be performed in such a manner to ensure continuity of effect of suppression of acid secretion. Patients with ZE Syndrome may be vulnerable to serious clinical complications of increased acid production even after a short period of loss of effective inhibition.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Instructions for Pathological Hypersecretion Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Only for intravenous infusion; other parenteral routes of administration are not recommended.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Fifteen Minute Infusion</span></span></p><p>1.

Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity and Severe Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylaxis and other serious reactions such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported with use of pantoprazole sodium for injection. These may require emergency medical treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Injection Site Reactions</h3><p class="First">Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of pantoprazole sodium for injection</p><h3>Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium for injection contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis</h3><p class="First">Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue pantoprazole sodium for injection and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium for injection may be associated with an increased risk of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile-</span>associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4), Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><h3>Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First">Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.</p><p>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</p><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</p><p>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving pantoprazole sodium for injection, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</p><h3>Hepatic Effects</h3><p class="First">Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered pantoprazole sodium for injection is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></p><h3>Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.</p><p>For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Fundic Gland Polyps</h3><p class="First">PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h3>Interference with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p class="First">Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop pantoprazole sodium for injection treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Interference with Urine Screen for THC</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium may produce false-positive urine screen for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole Sodium for Injection with Methotrexate</h3><p class="First">Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>Worldwide, approximately 80,500 patients have been treated with pantoprazole in clinical trials involving various dosages and duration of treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</span></span></p><p>Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another PPI, and 82 patients on placebo.

Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a Relative Risk (RR)=0.55, [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.08-3.95]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR=1.12 ([95% CI 0.86-1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR=1.29 [95% CI 0.84-1.97]).</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at intravenous pantoprazole doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (6 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) with administration of pantoprazole sodium during organogenesis in pregnant animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to pantoprazole.</p><p>A pre- and post-natal development toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate the effect on bone development was performed with pantoprazole sodium. Oral pantoprazole doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) were administered to pregnant females from gestation day (GD) 6 through lactation day (LD) 21. On postnatal day (PND 4) through PND 21, the pups were administered oral doses at 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 2.3, and 3.2 times the exposure (AUC) in humans at a dose of 40 mg). There were no drug-related findings in maternal animals. During the preweaning dosing phase (PND 4 to 21) of the pups, there were increased mortality and/or moribundity and decreased body weight and body weight gain at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans receiving the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. On PND 21, decreased mean femur length and weight and changes in femur bone mass and geometry were observed in the offspring at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. The femur findings included lower total area, bone mineral content and density, periosteal and endosteal circumference, and cross-sectional moment of inertia. There were no microscopic changes in the distal femur, proximal tibia, or stifle joints. Changes in bone parameters were partially reversible following a recovery period, with findings on PND 70 limited to lower femur metaphysis cortical/subcortical bone mineral density in female pups at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>Pantoprazole has been detected in breast milk of a nursing mother after a single 40 mg oral dose of pantoprazole.

Pantoprazole was detectable in milk only 2 and 4 hours after the dose with milk levels of approximately 36 mcg/L and 24 mcg/L, respectively. A milk-to-plasma ratio of 0.022 was observed at 2 hours after drug administration. Pantoprazole was not detectable (&lt;10 mcg/L) in milk at 6, 8 and 24 hours after the dose. The relative dose to the infant was estimated to be 7.3 mcg of pantoprazole, which is equivalent to 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose.

On PND 21, decreased mean femur length and weight and changes in femur bone mass and geometry were observed in the offspring at 5 mg/kg/day and higher doses. Changes in bone parameters were partially reversible following a recovery period <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>In neonatal/juvenile animals (rats and dogs) toxicities were similar to those observed in adult animals, including gastric alterations, decreases in red cell mass, increases in lipids, enzyme induction and hepatocellular hypertrophy. An increased incidence of eosinophilic chief cells in adult and neonatal/juvenile rats, and atrophy of chief cells in adult rats and in neonatal/juvenile dogs, was observed in the fundic mucosa of stomachs in repeated-dose studies. Full to partial recovery of these effects were noted in animals of both age groups following a recovery period.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of 286 patients in clinical studies of intravenous pantoprazole sodium in patients with GERD and a history of EE, 86 (43%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience with oral pantoprazole sodium has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Experience in patients taking very high doses of pantoprazole (greater than 240 mg) is limited. Adverse reactions seen in spontaneous reports of overdose generally reflect the known safety profile of pantoprazole.</p><p>Pantoprazole is not removed by hemodialysis. In case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.</p><p>Single intravenous doses of pantoprazole at 378, 230, and 266 mg/kg (38, 46, and 177 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) were lethal to mice, rats and dogs, respectively. The symptoms of acute toxicity were hypoactivity, ataxia, hunched sitting, limb-splay, lateral position, segregation, absence of ear reflex, and tremor.</p><h2>Pantoprazole Injection Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in pantoprazole sodium for injection (pantoprazole sodium), a PPI, is a substituted benzimidazole, sodium 5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-[[(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl] sulfinyl]-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-benzimidazole, a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">14</span>F<span class="Sub">2</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>NaO<span class="Sub">4</span>S, with a molecular weight of 405.4.

Pantoprazole sodium is freely soluble in water, very slightly soluble in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, and practically insoluble in n-hexane. The stability of the compound in aqueous solution is pH-dependent. The rate of degradation increases with decreasing pH. The reconstituted solution of pantoprazole sodium for injection is in the pH range 9.0 to 10.5.</p><p>Pantoprazole sodium for injection is supplied as a freeze-dried powder in a clear glass vial fitted with a rubber stopper and crimp seal containing pantoprazole sodium, equivalent to 40 mg of pantoprazole, edetate disodium (1 mg), and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH.</p><p>USP test 2 is used for organic impurities test.</p><h2>Pantoprazole Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Pantoprazole is a PPI that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H<span class="Sup">+</span>, K<span class="Sup">+</span>)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H<span class="Sup">+</span>, K<span class="Sup">+</span>)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Antisecretory Activity</span></span></p><p>The magnitude and time course for inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid output (PSAO) by single doses (20 to 120 mg) of pantoprazole sodium for injection were assessed in a single-dose, open-label, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. The results of this study are shown in <span class="Bold">Table 3</span>. Healthy subjects received a continuous infusion for 25 hours of pentagastrin (PG) at 1 mcg/kg/h, a dose known to produce submaximal gastric acid secretion. The placebo group showed a sustained, continuous acid output for 25 hours, validating the reliability of the testing model. Pantoprazole sodium for injection had an onset of antisecretory activity within 15 to 30 minutes of administration. Doses of 20 to 80 mg of pantoprazole sodium for injection substantially reduced the 24-hour cumulative PSAO in a dose-dependent manner, despite a short plasma elimination half-life. Complete suppression of PSAO was achieved with 80 mg within approximately 2 hours and no further significant suppression was seen with 120 mg. The duration of action of pantoprazole sodium for injection was 24 hours.</p><p class="First">0 mg<br/>

There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites have significant pharmacologic activity. CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3% of Caucasians and African-Americans and 17 to 23% of Asians).

A repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks of treatment revealed that 20 out of 23 (87%) patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection plus pantoprazole delayed-release tablets and 19 out of 22 (86%) of the patients treated with pantoprazole delayed-release tablets had endoscopically proven healing of their esophageal lesions.</p><p>Data comparing pantoprazole sodium for injection to other PPIs (oral or intravenous) or H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonists (oral or intravenous) are limited, and therefore, are inadequate to support any conclusions regarding comparative efficacy.</p><h3>Pathological Hypersecretion Associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Two studies measured the pharmacodynamic effects of 6 day treatment with pantoprazole sodium for injection in patients with ZE Syndrome (with and without multiple endocrine neoplasia type I). In one of these studies, an initial treatment with pantoprazole sodium for injection in 21 patients (29 to 75 years; 8 female; 4 Black, 1 Hispanic, 16 White) reduced acid output to the target level (10 mEq/h or less) and significantly reduced H<span class="Sup">+</span> concentration and the volume of gastric secretions; target levels were achieved within 45 minutes of drug administration.</p><p>In the other study of 14 patients (38 to 67 years; 5 female; 2 Black, 12 White) with ZE Syndrome, treatment was switched from an oral PPI to pantoprazole sodium for injection. Pantoprazole sodium for injection maintained or improved control of gastric acid secretion.</p><p>In both studies, total doses of 160 or 240 mg per day of pantoprazole sodium for injection, administered in divided doses, maintained basal acid secretion below target levels in all patients. Target levels were 10 mEq/h in patients without prior gastric surgery, and 5 mEq/h in all patients with prior gastric acid-reducing surgery. Once gastric acid secretion was controlled, there was no evidence of tolerance during this 7 day study. Basal acid secretion was maintained below target levels for at least 24 hours in all patients and through the end of treatment in these studies (3 to 7 days) in all but 1 patient who required a dose adjustment guided by acid output measurements until acid control was achieved. In both studies, doses were adjusted to the individual patient need, but gastric acid secretion was controlled in greater than 80% of patients by a starting regimen of 80 mg every 12 hours.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Pantoprazole sodium for injection is supplied as a freeze-dried powder containing 40 mg of pantoprazole per vial.</p><p>Pantoprazole sodium for injection is available as follows:</p><p>NDC 72572-550-01 – Package of 1 vial.
