</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Stop Blisovi 24 Fe if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs.</li>
<li>Stop Blisovi 24 Fe if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately <span class="Italics">[see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)].</span></li>
<li>If feasible, stop Blisovi 24 Fe at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during the following prolonged immobilization.</li>
<li>Start Blisovi 24 Fe no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</li>
<li>The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COCs and when restarting oral contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.</li>
<li>Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke.</li>
<li>Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</li>
</ul><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Impaired Liver Function</span></span></p><p>Do not use Blisovi 24 Fe in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span>Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Blisovi 24 Fe if jaundice develops.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Liver Tumors</span></span></p><p>Blisovi 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Blisovi 24 Fe prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>. Blisovi 24 Fe can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Blisovi 24 Fe is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span>. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Blisovi 24 Fe if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Blisovi 24 Fe. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Blisovi 24 Fe develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Blisovi 24 Fe if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of Blisovi 24 Fe in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></span></p><p>Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.</p><p>In a clinical trial of Blisovi 24 Fe, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 743 women (3,823 28-day cycles). A total of 10 subjects (1.3%) discontinued Blisovi 24 Fe, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trial, [24 to 38%] of women using Blisovi 24 Fe experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the six months of the trial. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></span></p><p>Women who use Blisovi 24 Fe may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. In the clinical trial with Blisovi 24 Fe, 31 to 41% of the women using Blisovi 24 Fe did not have a withdrawal menses in at least one of 6 cycles of use.Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was preexistent.</p><p>If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Blisovi 24 Fe use if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Blisovi 24 Fe if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix</h3><p class="First">Blisovi 24 Fe is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive <span class="Italics">[see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</span></p><p>There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><p>Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><h3>Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.</p><h3>Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Blisovi 24 Fe.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Serious cardiovascular events and stroke <span class="Italics">[see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Vascular events <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Liver disease <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)]</span></li>

<li>Irregular uterine bleeding</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Breast tenderness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of Blisovi 24 Fe was evaluated in 743 subjects who participated in an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of Blisovi 24 Fe for contraception. This trial examined healthy, non-pregnant volunteers aged 18 to 45 years, who were sexually active and had a body mass index of ≤ 35 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Subjects were followed for up to six 28-day cycles providing a total of 3,823 treatment-cycles of exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of all subjects)</span></span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 743 women using Blisovi 24 Fe were the following, in order of decreasing incidence: headache (6.3%), vaginal candidiasis (6.1%), nausea (4.6%), menstrual cramps (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.4%), mood changes (including mood swings (2.2%) and depression (1.1%)), bacterial vaginitis (3.1%), acne (2.7%), and weight gain (2.0%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation</span></span></p><p>Among the 743 women using Blisovi 24 Fe, 46 women (6.2%) withdrew because of an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in 3 or more subjects leading to discontinuation of treatment were, in decreasing order: abnormal bleeding (0.9%), nausea (0.8%), mood changes (0.8%), menstrual cramps (0.4%), increased blood pressure (0.4%), and irregular bleeding (0.4%).</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Blisovi 24 Fe. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular</span></span></p><p>Chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Endocrine Disorders</span></span></p><p>Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Eye Disorders</span></span></p><p>Blurred vision, visual impairment, transient blindness, corneal thinning, change in corneal curvature (steepening).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">GI Disorders</span></span></p><p>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, pancreatitis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary Disorders</span></span></p><p>Cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hepatic adenoma, hemangioma of liver.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Immune System Disorders</span></span></p><p>Anaphylactic reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, and severe reactions with respiratory and circulatory symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Infections</span></span></p><p>Vaginal infection.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders</span></span></p><p>Change in weight or appetite (increase or decrease). hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus, anemia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders</span></span></p><p>Myalgia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders</span></span></p><p>Alopecia, rash (generalized and allergic), pruritus, skin discoloration, night sweats, swelling face or lips, hirsutism, skin burning sensation, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, hemorrhagic eruption.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders</span></span></p><p>Headache, dizziness, migraine, hyperesthesia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, somnolence, loss of consciousness, sensory disturbance.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders</span></span></p><p>Mood swings, depression, insomnia, anxiety, suicidal ideation, panic attack, changes in libido, bipolar disorder, dissociation, homicidal ideation.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal and Urinary Disorders</span></span></p><p>Pollakiuria, dysuria, cystitis-like syndrome.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reproductive System and Breast Disorders</span></span></p><p>Breast changes (tenderness, pain, enlargement, and secretion), premenstrual syndrome, ovarian cyst, pelvic pain, ovarian cyst ruptured, pelvic fluid collection.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Vascular Disorders</span></span></p><p>Hot flush, thrombosis/embolism (coronary artery, pulmonary, cerebral, deep vein), migraine, transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with oral contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.</p><h3>Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs and Potentially Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs</span></span></p><p>Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives including phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs</span></span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Protease Inhibitors and Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritnoavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]).</p><h3>Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, and temazepam. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</p><p>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12)].</span></p><h3>Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer Blisovi 24 Fe with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations <span class="Italics">[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Interactions with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy. Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><p>Women who do not breastfeed should not start COCs earlier than 4 weeks postpartum.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Advise the nursing mother to use another contraceptive method, when possible, until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Blisovi 24 Fe have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same in postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 years as for users 18 years and older.

<li>Each active white tablet contains 1 mg norethindrone acetate and 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol. Inactive ingredients include acacia, confectioner's sugar, corn starch, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and talc.</li>
<li>Each placebo brown tablet contains 75 mg ferrous fumarate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, and sucrose. The ferrous fumarate tablets do not serve any therapeutic purpose. Ferrous fumarate tablets are not USP for dissolution.</li>

Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Blisovi 24 Fe.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Norethindrone acetate appears to be completely and rapidly deacetylated to norethindrone after oral administration, because the disposition of norethindrone acetate is indistinguishable from that of orally administered norethindrone. Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol are rapidly absorbed from Blisovi 24 Fe tablets, with maximum plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. Both are subject to first-pass metabolism after oral dosing, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 64% for norethindrone and 43% for ethinyl estradiol.</p><p>The plasma norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetics following single- and multiple-dose administrations of Blisovi 24 Fe tablets in 17 healthy female volunteers are provided in <span class="Bold">Figures 1</span> and <span class="Bold">2</span>, and <span class="Bold">Table 3</span>.</p><p>Following multiple-dose administration of Blisovi 24 Fe tablets, mean maximum concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol were increased by 95% and 27%, respectively, as compared to single-dose administration. Mean norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol exposures (AUC values) were increased by 164% and 51% respectively, as compared to single-dose administration of Blisovi 24 Fe tablets.</p><p>Steady-state with respect to norethindrone was reached by Day 17 and steady-state with respect to ethinyl estradiol was reached by Day 13.</p><p>Mean SHBG concentrations were increased by 150% from baseline (57.5 nmol/L) to 144 nmol/L at steady-state.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1.

Plasma protein binding of both steroids is extensive (&gt;95%); norethindrone binds to both albumin and SHBG, whereas ethinyl estradiol binds only to albumin. Although ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, it induces SHBG synthesis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></p><p>Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfates, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites.</p><p>Ethinyl estradiol is also extensively metabolized, both by oxidation and by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide. Sulfates are the major circulating conjugates of ethinyl estradiol and glucuronides predominate in urine. The primary oxidative metabolite is 2-hydroxy ethinyl estradiol, formed by the CYP3A4 isoform of cytochrome P450. Part of the first-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol is believed to occur in gastrointestinal mucosa. Ethinyl estradiol may undergo enterohepatic circulation.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></span></p><p>Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites. Plasma clearance values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol are similar (approximately 0.4 L/hr/kg). Steady-state elimination half-lives of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of Blisovi 24 Fe tablets are approximately 8 hours and 14 hours, respectively.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.11) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1).]</span></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In an active-controlled clinical trial, 743 women 18 to 45 years of age were studied to assess the efficacy of Blisovi 24 Fe, for up to six 28-day cycles.
