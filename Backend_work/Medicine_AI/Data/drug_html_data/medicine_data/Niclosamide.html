Anthelmintics are medicines used in the treatment of worm infections.</p><p>Niclosamide is used to treat broad or fish tapeworm, dwarf tapeworm, and beef tapeworm infections. Niclosamide may also be used for other tapeworm infections as determined by your doctor. It will not work for other types of worm infections (for example, pinworms or roundworms).</p><p>Niclosamide works by killing tapeworms on contact. The killed worms are then passed in the stool. However, you may not notice them since they are sometimes destroyed in the intestine.</p><p>Niclosamide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using niclosamide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For niclosamide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to niclosamide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Niclosamide has been tested in a limited number of children 2 years of age or older and, in effective doses, has not been reported to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of niclosamide in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of niclosamide</h2><p>No special preparations or additional steps (for example, special diets, fasting, other medicines, laxatives, or enemas) are necessary before, during, or immediately after taking niclosamide.</p><p>Niclosamide may be taken on an empty stomach (either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). However, to prevent stomach upset, it is best taken after a light meal (for example, breakfast).</p><p>Niclosamide tablets should be thoroughly chewed or crushed and then swallowed with a small amount of water. If niclosamide is being given to a young child, the tablets should be crushed to a fine powder and mixed with a small amount of water to form a paste.</p><p>For patients taking niclosamide for beef tapeworms or broad or fish tapeworms:</p><ul>
<li>To help clear up your infection completely, take niclosamide exactly as directed by your doctor. Usually one dose is enough. However, in some patients a second dose of niclosamide may be required to clear up the infection completely.</li>
</ul><p>For patients taking niclosamide for dwarf tapeworms :</p><ul>
<li>To help clear up your infection completely, keep taking niclosamide for the full time of treatment (usually 7 days) , even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days. In some patients, a second course of niclosamide may be required to clear up the infection completely. If you stop taking niclosamide too soon, your infection may return. Do not miss any doses. Some patients with tapeworm infections may not notice any symptoms or may have only mild symptoms.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of niclosamide will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of niclosamide. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
