</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of oxytocin</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you oxytocin. Oxytocin is given through a needle placed in one of your veins or as a shot into one of your muscles.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using oxytocin</h2><p>Oxytocin can be very useful for helping labor. However, there are certain risks with using it. Oxytocin causes contractions of the uterus. In women who are unusually sensitive to its effects, these contractions may become too strong.

If you have concerns about this, ask your doctor.</p><p>Oxytocin may cause a serious condition called water intoxication. Tell your doctor right away if you start having have confusion, drowsiness, headache, or seizures while you are receiving oxytocin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Oxytocin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
