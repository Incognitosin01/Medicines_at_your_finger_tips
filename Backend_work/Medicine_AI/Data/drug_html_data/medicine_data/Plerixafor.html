Tell your doctor if you become pregnant.</p><p>You may need to have a negative pregnancy test before starting this treatment.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while receiving this medication.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is plerixafor given?</h2><p>Plerixafor is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>You will be watched closely for at least 30 minutes to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction.</p><p>Before receiving plerixafor, you will be given a medication called a granulocyte (GRAN-yoo-loe-site) colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). A G-CSF helps your body produce stem cells and white blood cells to help support your immune system.</p><p>Plerixafor works together with the G-CSF by causing stem cells and granulocytes produced in the bone marrow to circulate into your bloodstream where they can be collected in blood drawn from your vein.</p><p>After your blood is drawn, it will be processed so that the needed stem cells and granulocytes can be separated from other unneeded parts of the blood. These stem cells and granulocytes will then be "transplanted" back into your body.</p><p>Your blood will need to be tested often during your treatment.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive plerixafor in a clinical setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since this medication is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include stomach discomfort, severe dizziness, or fainting.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving plerixafor?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Plerixafor side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Tell your caregivers at once if you have a serious side effect such as:</p><ul>
