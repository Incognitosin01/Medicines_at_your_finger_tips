Another form of HPV vaccine (Cervarix) is used only in females. This medication guide provides information only for Gardasil (HPV quadrivalent vaccine).</p><p>HPV quadrivalent vaccine is used in girls and young women ages 9 through 26 to prevent cervical/vaginal/anal cancers caused by certain types of HPV.</p><p>HPV quadrivalent vaccine is also used in boys and young men ages 9 through 26 to prevent anal cancer or genital warts caused by certain types of HPV.</p><p>You may receive this vaccine even if you have already had genital warts, or had a positive HPV test or abnormal pap smear in the past. However, this vaccine <b>will not treat</b> active genital warts or HPV-related cancers, and it <b>will not cure</b> HPV infection.</p><p>HPV quadrivalent vaccine only prevents diseases caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. It will not prevent diseases caused by other types of HPV.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HPV vaccine for all boys and girls ages 11 or 12 years old. The vaccine is also recommended in teenage boys and girls who have not already received the vaccine or have not completed all booster shots.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the HPV quadrivalent vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><p>HPV quadrivalent vaccine may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you have had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>You may feel faint during the first 15 minutes after receiving this vaccine. Some people have had seizure-like reactions after receiving this vaccine.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to an HPV vaccine, or if you are allergic to yeast.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a fever higher than 100 degrees F (37.8 degrees C);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>treatment with cancer medicine, steroids, or other drugs that can weaken your immune system.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>a fever higher than 100 degrees F (37.8 degrees C);</p><p>a weak immune system; or</p><p>treatment with cancer medicine, steroids, or other drugs that can weaken your immune system.</p><p><b>You should not receive this vaccine if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>It is not known whether HPV quadrivalent vaccine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>HPV vaccine will not protect against sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, HIV, syphilis, and trichomoniasis.</p><h2>How is human papillomavirus vaccine given?</h2><p>HPV vaccine is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle in your upper arm or thigh. You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting.</p><p>HPV quadrivalent vaccine is given in a series of 3 shots. You may have the first shot at any time as long as you are between the ages of 9 and 26 years old. Then you will need to receive a second dose 2 months after your first shot, and a third dose 6 months after your first shot.</p><p>Be sure you receive all recommended doses of this vaccine. If you do not receive the full series of vaccines, you may not be fully protected against the disease.</p><p>An HPV vaccine should not be used in place of having a routine pelvic exam, Pap smear, or anal exam to screen for cervical or anal cancer.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Contact your doctor if you will miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving human papillomavirus vaccine?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Human papillomavirus vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>You may feel faint after receiving this vaccine. Some people have had seizure-like reactions after receiving a human papilloma virus vaccine. Your doctor may want you to remain under observation during the first 15 minutes after the injection.</p><p>Developing cancer from HPV is much more dangerous to your health than receiving the vaccine to protect against it. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
