Contraindicated in patients with: advanced renal impairment, risk of renal failure due to volume depletion, cerebrovascular bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis, or high-risk of bleeding. Contraindicated in patients receiving concomitant aspirin or NSAIDs, or as prophylactic analgesic before any major surgery. Contraindicated in labor and delivery and in nursing mothers.

It belongs to the group of medicines called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Ketorolac is not a narcotic and is not habit-forming. It will not cause physical or mental dependence, as narcotics can. However, ketorolac is sometimes used together with a narcotic to provide better pain relief than either medicine used alone.</p><p>Ketorolac has side effects that can be very dangerous. The risk of having a serious side effect increases with the dose of ketorolac and with the length of treatment. Therefore, ketorolac should not be used for more than 5 days. Before using ketorolac, you should discuss with your doctor the good that ketorolac can do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>Ketorolac is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ketorolac</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ketorolac, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ketorolac or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on ketorolac have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of ketorolac in children up to 16 years of age with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Stomach or intestinal problems, swelling of the face, feet, or lower legs, or sudden decrease in the amount of urine may be especially likely to occur in elderly patients, who are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of ketorolac. Also, elderly people are more likely than younger adults to get very sick if the medicine causes stomach problems. Studies in older adults have shown that ketorolac stays in the body longer than it does in younger people. Your doctor will consider this when deciding on how much ketorolac should be given for each dose and how often it should be given.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using ketorolac.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking ketorolac, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using ketorolac with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of ketorolac. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol abuse or</li>
<li>Diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes) or</li>
<li>Edema (swelling of face, fingers, feet or lower legs caused by too much fluid in the body) or</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of ketorolac</h2><p>For patients taking ketorolac tablets:</p><ul>
<li>To lessen stomach upset, ketorolac tablets should be taken with food (a meal or a snack) or with an antacid.</li>
<li>Take ketorolac with a full glass of water. Also, do not lie down for about 15 to 30 minutes after taking it. This helps to prevent irritation that may lead to trouble in swallowing.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using ketorolac injection:</p><ul>
<li>Medicines given by injection are sometimes used at home. If you will be using ketorolac at home, your health care professional will teach you how the injections are to be given. You will also have a chance to practice giving injections. Be certain that you understand exactly how the medicine is to be injected.</li>
</ul><p>For safe and effective use of ketorolac, do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for more than 5 days. Using too much of ketorolac increases the chance of unwanted effects, especially in elderly patients.</p><p>Ketorolac should be used only when it is ordered by your doctor for treating certain kinds of pain. Because of the risk of serious side effects, do not save any leftover ketorolac for use in the future, and do not share it with other people.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of ketorolac will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of ketorolac. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
<li>For oral dosage form (tablets):
<ul>
<li>For pain:
<ul>
<li>Adults (patients 16 years of age and older)—One 10-milligram (mg) tablet four times a day, four to six hours apart. Some people may be directed to take two tablets for the first dose only.</li>
