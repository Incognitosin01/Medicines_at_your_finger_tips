Discontinue infliximab-dyyb if a patient develops a serious infection. Perform test for latent TB; if positive, start treatment for TB prior to starting infliximab-dyyb. Monitor all patients for active TB during treatment, even if initial latent TB test is negative. Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including infliximab. Postmarketing cases of fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including infliximab products. Almost all had received azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. The majority of reported cases have occurred in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, most of whom were adolescent or young adult males .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 2 hours.</p><p>This medicine comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.</p><p>You may also receive medicines (eg, allergy medicine, fever medicine, steroids) to help prevent possible unwanted effects during the injection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Inflectra</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Infliximab-dyyb may cause an infusion reaction while you are receiving it or right after the infusion ends. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you have chest pain, fever, chills, itching, hives, rash, dizziness, fainting, lightheadedness, headache, joint pain, difficulty with swallowing, shortness of breath, trouble breathing, or swelling of the face, tongue, and throat.</p><p>Your body's ability to fight an infection may be reduced while you are using infliximab-dyyb.

Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this medicine have developed certain types of cancer. This is more common in patients who have lung diseases (eg, COPD) or are heavy smokers, and in psoriasis patients who have had phototherapy treatment for a long time. Phototherapy treatment is ultraviolet light or sunlight combined with oral medicine to make your skin sensitive to light. Some teenagers and young adults with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis also developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, unexplained weight loss, or red, scaly patches, or raised bumps with pus on the skin.</p><p>Receiving this medicine may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma) or cervical cancer. If you have any changes or growths on your skin, abnormal vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain, check with your doctor right away.</p><p>It is important to have your heart checked closely if you receive infliximab-dyyb.

Your child's vaccinations must be current before receiving infliximab-dyyb. Talk to your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.</p><p>If you have a baby while receiving infliximab-dyyb, make sure the baby's doctor knows that you were receiving this medicine.
