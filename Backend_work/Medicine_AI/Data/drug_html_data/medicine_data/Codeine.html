Ask your doctor before making any changes in how or when you take your medications.</p><p><b>If you use this medicine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug.</b> This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born.

Maximum dose: 360 mg in 24 hours<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
-Initial doses should be individualized taking into account severity of pain, response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse.<br/>
-Doses higher than 60 mg have not been shown to improve pain relief and are associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects.<br/>
-Because of the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals should be used.<br/>
-Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following any increase in dose.<br/>
<br/>
