Apply a thin layer to the affected area and rub in gently.</p><p>To treat diaper rash, use zinc oxide topical each time the diaper is changed. Also apply the medicine at bedtime or whenever there will be a long period of time between diaper changes. Change wet diapers as soon as possible.

Avoid handling the suppository too long or it will melt. Lie on your back with your knees up toward your chest.

Avoid using the bathroom for at least an hour.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 7 days of treatment.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
