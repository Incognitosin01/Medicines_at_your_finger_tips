Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in individuals who are infected with HBV and discontinue emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. If appropriate, initiation of antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted. Emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide used for HIV-1 pre-exposure prophylaxis must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and at least every 3 months during use.
