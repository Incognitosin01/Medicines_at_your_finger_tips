In a genetic condition called X-linked hypophosphatemia (HYE-poe-fos-fa-TEEM-ee-a), low phosphate levels in blood are caused by abnormally high levels of FGF23 protein, which causes the kidneys to stop reabsorbing phosphate into the bloodstream.</p><p>Blocking the FGF23 protein allows the kidneys to restore and maintain normal phosphate levels. Phosphate is important for the strength of your bones and teeth. Low phosphate levels can lead to bone deformities and growth problems.</p><p>Crysvita is used to normalize phosphate levels in adults and children who are at least 1 year old and have X-linked hypophosphatemia.</p><p>Crysvita may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Crysvita if you have severe kidney disease, or if you currently take phosphate or vitamin D by mouth.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Crysvita if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>
