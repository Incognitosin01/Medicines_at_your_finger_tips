It is given orally as a powder mixed into a liquid.</p><p>EnteraGam is indicated for:</p><ul>
<li>use in patients for the clinical dietary management of enteropathy in patients who have a limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize certain nutrients.</li>
<li>the clinical dietary management of enteropathy in patients with chronic loose or frequent stools (for example, diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome [IBS-D], inflammatory bowel disease [IBDD] and HIV-associated enteropathy).</li>
</ul><p>Utilization of nutrition depends on appropriate digestion of food and optimal gut metabolism and absorption of nutrients. Some patients (for example, those with IBS-D or HIV-associated enteropathy) are not able to adequately ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize food and certain nutrients, including water. Medical foods are meant to manage conditions or diseases in which there is a distinct nutritional need. EnteraGam is a ‘generally recognized as safe’ (GRAS) ingredient for enteral and/or oral administration, as designated by the FDA.</p><p>EnteraGam is labeled for use in adults and children two years of age and older. EnteraGam is <strong>contraindicated</strong> (not to be used) in patients with a hypersensitivity (allergy) to beef or any other components in the product. The active ingredient in the product is a beef-derived protein that consists of more than 50 percent immunoglobulin.</p><p>EnteraGam is manufactured and distributed by Entera Health, Inc. and has been commercially available since August 2013.</p><p><strong>EnteraGam Formulations Available in the U.S.</strong></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">What is a Medical Food?</h2><p>Medical foods are regulated by the FDA under the Orphan Drug Act, and are specially formulated to be taken by mouth or given directly into the gastrointestinal tract (as through a tube). Medical foods are to be used under a physician’s care but are not “prescription only” products as defined by the FDA. Medical foods are part of ongoing care to ensure adequate nutritional needs are met in those who cannot achieve adequate nutrition by normal dietary intake. Ingredients in medical foods must be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA.</p><p>According to the FDA, medical foods are not drugs and, therefore, are not subject to any regulatory requirements that specifically apply to drugs. For example, medical foods do not have to undergo premarket review or approval. Medical foods must comply with all applicable FDA requirements for foods, including the Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. FDA does not maintain a list of medical food products.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">EnteraGam Dosing</h2><p>EnteraGam has been safely used in various clinical studies up to 1 year in length among adults and children and has no restrictions on the length of therapy.</p><p>If you have additional questions about EnteraGam, you can ask your healthcare provider for a package insert that is written for healthcare providers.</p><h2>Before receiving EnteraGam</h2><p>Before you receive EnteraGam, tell your healthcare professional about all of your medical conditions.
