Histrelin overstimulates the body's own production of certain hormones, which causes that production to shut down temporarily.</p><p>The Vantas implant is used to treat symptoms of prostate cancer in men.</p><p>Vantas treats only the symptoms of prostate cancer but does not treat the cancer itself.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Vantas can cause side effects such as crying spells, anger, aggression, and feeling restless or irritable. Call your doctor if you have any new or worsening mental problems.</p><p>Before you receive a Vantas implant, tell your doctor if you have painful or difficult urination, diabetes, heart disease, coronary artery disease, liver disease, a history of heart attack or stroke, osteoporosis, or a condition affecting your spine.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have a serious side effect such as severe numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, muscle weakness, problems with balance or coordination, loss of bladder or bowel control, urinating more or less than usual, sudden numbness or severe headache, problems with speech or vision, increased thirst or urination, excessive hunger, or chest pain spreading to the arm or shoulder.</p><p>A Vantas implant is usually left in place for 12 months and then removed. Your doctor will determine at that time whether you need to receive another implant for treatment of your symptoms.</p><h2>Before I receive this medicine</h2><p>You should not use a Vantas implant if you are allergic to histrelin or to similar hormone medications such as leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard, Viadur), nafarelin (Synarel), or ganirelix (Antagon).</p><p>Vantas should not be used in women or children.</p><p><b>Do not use Vantas if you are pregnant.</b> It could harm the unborn baby or cause a miscarriage. Use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy and tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.</p><p>Vantas should not be used in women or children.</p><p>To make sure Vantas is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p><b>Vantas</b> is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><h2>How is Vantas given?</h2><p>Vantas is given in a tiny implant inserted under the skin on the inside of your upper arm. You will receive this implant with a minor surgical procedure in a clinic or doctor's office.</p><p>It is best to place the implant into your non-dominant arm (your left arm if you are right-handed). Be sure to tell your doctor which arm you use most often.</p><p>While lying on your back, your arm will be positioned with your elbow bent and held still while the implant is inserted. The skin of your upper arm will be treated with a numbing medicine to keep you from feeling pain during the insertion. Once your arm is numb, your doctor will use a scalpel to cut a small incision where the implant will be inserted.</p><p>The Vantas implant is inserted using a special tool that pushes the implant into place through the incision in your skin. After injecting the implant and removing the insertion tool, your doctor will then feel your arm to make sure the implant has been correctly placed.</p><p>The incision in your skin may be closed with stitches or surgical strips. Follow your doctor's instructions about caring for the incision and keeping it bandaged and clean until it heals completely. Keep your arm dry for at least 24 hours.</p><p>You will most likely be able to feel the implant through your skin, but it should not cause pain or discomfort.</p><p>A Vantas implant is usually left in place for 12 months and then must be removed through a surgical incision. Do not try to remove the implant yourself. Your doctor will determine whether you need another implant for continued treatment.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have any pain, swelling, tenderness, itching, tingling, bruising, or redness where the implant was inserted, or if the implant comes through the skin or falls out.</p><p>To be sure this medicine is helping your condition, you may need frequent blood tests. Your blood work will help your doctor determine how long to treat you with Vantas.</p><p>Histrelin can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Prostate Cancer:</b></p><p>One 50 mg implant inserted subcutaneously in the inner aspect of the upper arm<br/>
