It will not eliminate wrinkles or repair sun-damaged skin.</p><p>Renova may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays (sunlamps or tanning beds). Renova can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and sunburn may result. Use a sunscreen (minimum SPF 15) and wear protective clothing if you must be out in the sun. Avoid getting Renova in your eyes, mouth, and nose, or on your lips. If it does get into any of these areas, wash with water. Do not use Renova on sunburned, windburned, dry, chapped, irritated, or broken skin. Also avoid using Renova in wounds or on areas of eczema. Wait until these conditions have healed before using Renova.</p><p>Use this medication for as many days as it has been prescribed for you even if you think it is not working. It may take weeks or months of use before you notice improvement in your skin.</p><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all your medical conditions, allergies, and all medicines you use.</p><h2>Before using Renova</h2><p>You should not use Renova if you are allergic to tretinoin.</p><p>It is not known whether Renova will harm an unborn baby.

Using more medicine or applying it more often than prescribed will not make it work any faster, and may increase side effects. Do not use Renova for longer than your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>Do not take by mouth. Renova is for use only on the skin. Do not use this medicine on open wounds or on sunburned, windburned, dry, chapped, or irritated skin.</p><p>Wash your hands before and after applying Renova Cream. You should apply Renova Cream to your face once a day before retiring using only enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Gently wash your face with a mild soap, pat the skin dry, and wait 20 to 30 minutes before applying the cream. Apply a pea-sized amount of cream to cover your entire face. You may feel a warmth or slight stinging when Renova Cream is first applied.</p><p>You must be especially careful when applying the cream to avoid your eyes, ears, nostrils, or mouth. Renova may cause severe redness, itching, burning, stinging, and peeling if applied to these areas.</p><p>Using larger than necessary amounts of Renova will not speed results and can cause an overdose. An overdose can result in red and peeling skin as well as some pain or discomfort.</p><p>Applying Renova to wet skin may cause skin irritation. Wait at least 20 minutes after washing your face before applying a thin layer of the medication.</p><p>Do not wash the treated area for at least 1 hour after applying Renova. Avoid the use of other skin products on the treated area for at least 1 hour following application of Renova.</p><p>Renova should be used as part of a complete skin care program that includes avoiding sunlight and using an effective sunscreen and protective clothing.</p><p>Use this medication for the full prescribed length of time, even if you think it is not working.</p><p>It may take up to several weeks before you notice improvement in your skin. Keep using the medication as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the missed dose as soon as you remember.
