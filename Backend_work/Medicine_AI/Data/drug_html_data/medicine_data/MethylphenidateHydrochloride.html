</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets</span><span class="Sup"> </span><span class="Bold">should be given cautiously to patients with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism. Chronic abusive use can lead to marked tolerance and psychological dependence with varying degrees of abnormal behavior. Frank psychotic episodes can occur, especially with parenteral abuse. Careful supervision is required during withdrawal from abusive use since severe depression may occur. Withdrawal following chronic therapeutic use may unmask symptoms of the underlying disorder that may require follow-up.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Methylphenidate Hydrochloride</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>are indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children 6 years of age and older, adolescents, and adults up to the age of 65 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.  </p><p>A diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; DSM-IV) implies the presence of hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment and were present before age 7 years. The symptoms must cause clinically significant impairment, e.g., in social, academic, or occupational functioning, and be present in two or more settings, e.g., school (or work) and at home. The symptoms must not be better accounted for by another mental disorder. For the Inattentive Type, at least six of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months: lack of attention to details/careless mistakes; lack of sustained attention; poor listener; failure to follow through on tasks; poor organization; avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort; loses things; easily distracted; forgetful. For the Hyperactive-Impulsive Type, at least six of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months: fidgeting/squirming; leaving seat; inappropriate running/climbing; difficulty with quiet activities; “on the go;” excessive talking; blurting answers; can’t wait turn; intrusive. The Combined Type requires both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive criteria to be met.</p><h3>1.1 Special Diagnostic Considerations</h3><p class="First">Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use of medical and special psychological, educational, and social resources. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the patient and not solely on the presence of the required number of DSM-IV characteristics.</p><h3>1.2 Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets are indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that may include other measures (psychological, educational, social). Drug treatment may not be indicated for all patients with ADHD. Stimulants are not intended for use in patients who exhibit symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or other primary psychiatric disorders, including psychosis. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe stimulant medication will depend upon the physician's assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient’s symptoms.</p><h2>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>2.1 General Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>should be administered orally once daily in the morning with or without food.  </p><p>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>must be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids, and must not be chewed, divided, or crushed <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (</span>17<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>2.2 Patients New to Methylphenidate</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients who are not currently taking methylphenidate or stimulants other than methylphenidate is 18 mg once daily for children and adolescents and 18 or 36 mg once daily for adults (see Table 1).  </p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1. Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>Recommended Starting Doses and Dose Ranges</span></p><h3>2.3 Patients Currently Using Methylphenidate</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>for patients who are currently taking methylphenidate twice daily or three times daily at doses of 10 to 60 mg/day is provided in Table 2. Dosing recommendations are based on current dose regimen and clinical judgment. Conversion dosage should not exceed 72 mg daily.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2. Recommended Dose Conversion from Methylphenidate Regimens to Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets</span></p><p>Other methylphenidate regimens: Clinical judgment should be used when selecting the starting dose.</p><h3>2.4 Dose Titration</h3><p class="First">Doses may be increased in 18 mg increments at weekly intervals for patients who have not achieved an optimal response at a lower dose. Daily dosages above 54 mg in children and 72 mg in adolescents have not been studied and are not recommended. Daily dosages above 72 mg in adults are not recommended.</p><p>A 27 mg dosage strength is available for physicians who wish to prescribe between the 18 mg and 36 mg dosages.</p><h3>2.5 Maintenance/Extended Treatment</h3><p class="First">There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to indicate how long the patient with ADHD should be treated with Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets. It is generally agreed, however, that pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods.  </p><p>The effectiveness of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets for long-term use, i.e., for more than 7 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. The physician who elects to use Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>for extended periods in patients with ADHD should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient with trials off medication to assess the patient’s functioning without pharmacotherapy. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued.</p><h3>2.6 Dose Reduction and Discontinuation</h3><p class="First">If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse events occur, the dosage should be reduced, or, if necessary, the drug should be discontinued.  </p><p>If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP are available in the following dosage strengths:  </p><p>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets USP, 18 mg are purple colored, capsule-shaped tablets imprinted with 'RDY 18' in black ink.  </p><p>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets USP, 27 mg are pink colored, capsule-shaped tablets imprinted with 'RDY 27' in black ink.  </p><p>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets USP, 36 mg are orange colored, capsule-shaped tablets imprinted with 'RDY 36' in black ink.  </p><p>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets USP, 54 mg are blue colored, capsule-shaped tablets imprinted with 'RDY 54' in black ink.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>4.1 Hypersensitivity to Methylphenidate</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions, have been observed in patients treated with Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Therefore, Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>are contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to methylphenidate or other components of the product <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.6<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>4.2 Agitation</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with marked anxiety, tension, and agitation, since the drug may aggravate these symptoms.</p><h3>4.3 Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma.</p><h3>4.4 Tics</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>are contraindicated in patients with motor tics or with a family history or diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.4<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>4.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>are contraindicated during treatment with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, and also within a minimum of 14 days following discontinuation of a MAO inhibitor (hypertensive crises may result) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span>7.1<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Serious Cardiovascular Events</h3><p class="First">Sudden Death and Preexisting Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems  </p><p><span class="Italics">Children and Adolescents</span></p><p>Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Adults</span></p><p>Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs.  </p><p>Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions</p><p>Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2 to 4 mm Hg) and average heart rate (about 3 to 6 bpm) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.5<span class="Italics">)],</span> and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g., those with preexisting hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia.  </p><p>Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients Being Treated with Stimulant Medications Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.</p><h3>5.2 Psychiatric Adverse Events</h3><p class="First">Preexisting Psychosis</p><p>Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder.  </p><p>Bipolar Illness</p><p>Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in such patients. Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.  </p><p>Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms</p><p>Treatment-emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by stimulants at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.1% (4 patients with events out of 3,482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usual doses) of stimulant-treated patients compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.  </p><p>Aggression</p><p>Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in patients with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility.  </p><h3>5.3 Seizures</h3><p class="First">There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued.</p><h3>5.4 Priapism</h3><p class="First">Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products, including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets, in both pediatric and adult patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.6<span class="Italics">)]</span>. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.</p><h3>5.5 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s Phenomenon</h3><p class="First">Stimulants, including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</p><h3>5.6 Long-Term Suppression of Growth</h3><p class="First">Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or nonmedication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and nonmedication-treated children over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated children (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause similar suppression of growth; however, it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well. Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p><h3>5.7 Visual Disturbance</h3><p class="First">Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment.</p><h3>5.8 Potential for Gastrointestinal Obstruction</h3><p class="First">Because the Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>are nondeformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the GI tract, Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>should not ordinarily be administered to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, “short gut” syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or Meckel’s diverticulum). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations. Due to the controlled-release design of the tablet, Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>should be used only in patients who are able to swallow the tablet whole <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h3>5.9 Hematologic Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Periodic CBC, differential, and platelet counts are advised during prolonged therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:  </p><p>• Drug Dependence <span class="Italics">[see</span> Box Warning<span class="Italics">]</span> </p><p>• Hypersensitivity to Methylphenidate <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4.1<span class="Italics">)]</span> </p><p>• Agitation <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4.2<span class="Italics">)]  </span></p><p>• Glaucoma <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4.3<span class="Italics">)]</span> </p><p>• Tics <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4.4<span class="Italics">)]  </span></p><p>• Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4.5<span class="Italics">) and Drug Interactions (</span>7.1<span class="Italics">)]  </span></p><p>• Serious Cardiovascular Events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.1<span class="Italics">)]  </span></p><p>• Psychiatric Adverse Events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">)]</span> </p><p>• Seizures <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.3<span class="Italics">)]</span> </p><p>• Priapism <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.4<span class="Italics">)]</span> </p><p>• Long-Term Suppression of Growth <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.6<span class="Italics">)]</span> </p><p>• Visual Disturbance <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.7<span class="Italics">)]</span> </p><p>• Potential for Gastrointestinal Obstruction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.8<span class="Italics">)]</span> </p><p>• Hematologic Monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.9<span class="Italics">)]  </span></p><p>The most common adverse reaction in double-blind clinical trials (&gt;5%) in pediatric patients (children and adolescents) was abdominal pain upper.

Children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD were evaluated in 6 controlled clinical studies and 11 open-label clinical studies (see Table 3). Safety was assessed by collecting adverse events, vital signs, weights, and ECGs, and by performing physical examinations and laboratory analyses.      </p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3.</span> <span class="Bold">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets</span> <span class="Bold">Exposure in Double-Blind and Open-Label Clinical Studies</span></p><p>Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. Consequently, to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology.  </p><p>The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.  </p><p>Throughout this section, adverse reactions are reported. Adverse reactions are adverse events that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride based on the comprehensive assessment of the available adverse event information. A causal association for Methylphenidate Hydrochloride often cannot be reliably established in individual cases. Further, because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity.</p><h3>6.1 Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">Adverse reactions in either the pediatric or adult double-blind adverse reactions tables may be relevant for both patient populations.  </p><p>Children and Adolescents  </p><p>Table 4 lists the adverse reactions reported in 1% or more of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated children and adolescent subjects in 4 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials. <span class="None"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4.

Chronic abusive use can lead to marked tolerance and psychological dependence with varying degrees of abnormal behavior. Frank psychotic episodes can occur, especially with parenteral abuse.  </p><p>In two placebo-controlled human abuse potential studies, single oral doses of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>were compared to single oral doses of immediate-release methylphenidate (IR MPH) and placebo in subjects with a history of recreational stimulant use to assess relative abuse potential.

Withdrawal following chronic therapeutic use may unmask symptoms of the underlying disorder that may require follow-up.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>10.1 Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Signs and symptoms of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride overdosage, resulting principally from overstimulation of the CNS and from excessive sympathomimetic effects, may include the following: vomiting, agitation, muscle twitching, convulsion, grand mal convulsion, confusional state, hallucinations (auditory and/or visual), hyperhidrosis, headache, pyrexia, tachycardia, palpitations, heart rate increased, sinus arrhythmia, hypertension, rhabdomyolysis, mydriasis, and dry mouth.</p><h3>10.2 Recommended Treatment</h3><p class="First">Treatment consists of appropriate supportive measures. The patient must be protected against self-injury and against external stimuli that would aggravate overstimulation already present. Gastric contents may be evacuated by gastric lavage as indicated. Before performing gastric lavage, control agitation and seizures if present and protect the airway. Other measures to detoxify the gut include administration of activated charcoal and a cathartic. Intensive care must be provided to maintain adequate circulation and respiratory exchange; external cooling procedures may be required for pyrexia.  </p><p>Efficacy of peritoneal dialysis or extracorporeal hemodialysis for Methylphenidate Hydrochloride overdosage has not been established.  </p><p>The prolonged release of methylphenidate from Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>should be considered when treating patients with overdose.</p><h3>10.3 Poison Control Center</h3><p class="First">As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple-drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of overdosage with methylphenidate.</p><h2>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Description</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>are available in four strengths. Each extended-release tablet for once-a-day oral administration contains 18, 27, 36, or 54 mg of methylphenidate HCl USP and is designed to have a 12-hour duration of effect. Chemically, methylphenidate HCl is d,l (racemic) methyl α-phenyl-2-piperidineacetate hydrochloride.

The system, which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance, comprises an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. The trilayer core is composed of two drug layers containing the drug and excipients, and a push layer containing osmotically active components. There is a precision-laser drilled orifice on the drug-layer end of the tablet. In an aqueous environment, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the drug overcoat dissolves within one hour, providing an initial dose of methylphenidate. Water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core. As the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, methylphenidate is released through the orifice. The membrane controls the rate at which water enters the tablet core, which in turn controls drug delivery. Furthermore, the drug release rate from the system increases with time over a period of 6 to 7 hours due to the drug-concentration gradient incorporated into the two drug layers of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the stool as a tablet shell along with insoluble core components. It is possible that Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be visible on abdominal x-rays under certain circumstances, especially when digital enhancing techniques are utilized. “FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP”.</p><h2>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate HCl is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not known. Methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d-and l-isomers. The d-isomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-isomer.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Absorption</p><p>Methylphenidate is readily absorbed. Following oral administration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride, plasma methylphenidate concentrations increase rapidly, reaching an initial maximum at about 1 hour, followed by gradual ascending concentrations over the next 5 to 9 hours, after which a gradual decrease begins. Mean times to reach peak plasma concentrations across all doses of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride occurred between 6 and 10 hours.  </p><p>Methylphenidate Hydrochloride extended-release tablets<span class="Sup"> </span>once daily minimizes the fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with immediate-release methylphenidate three times daily (see Figure 1).

Pharmacokinetic Parameters (Mean ± SD) After Single Dose in Healthy Adults</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride were evaluated in healthy adults following single and multiple-dose administration (steady state) of doses up to 144 mg/day. The mean half-life was about 3.6 hours. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride were noted following single and repeated once-daily dosing, indicating no significant drug accumulation. The AUC and t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> following repeated once-daily dosing are similar to those following the first dose of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride in a dose range of 18 to 144 mg.  </p><p>Dose Proportionality</p><p>Following administration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride in single doses of 18, 36, and  54 mg/day to healthy adults, C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-inf)</span> of d-methylphenidate were proportional to dose, whereas l-methylphenidate C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-inf)</span> increased disproportionately with respect to dose. Following administration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride, plasma concentrations of the l-isomer were approximately 1/40 the plasma concentrations of the d-isomer.  </p><p>In healthy adults, single and multiple dosing of once-daily Methylphenidate Hydrochloride doses from 54 to 144 mg/day resulted in linear and dose-proportional increases in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> for total methylphenidate (MPH) and its major metabolite, α-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (PPAA). There was no time dependency in the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate. The ratio of metabolite (PPAA) to parent drug (MPH) was constant across doses from 54 to 144 mg/day, both after single dose and upon multiple dosing.  </p><p>In a multiple-dose study in adolescent ADHD patients aged 13 to 16 administered their prescribed dose (18 to 72 mg/day) of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride, mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">TAU</span> of d-and total methylphenidate increased proportionally with respect to dose.  </p><p>Distribution</p><p>Plasma methylphenidate concentrations in adults and adolescents decline biexponentially following oral administration. The half-life of methylphenidate in adults and adolescents following oral administration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride was approximately 3.5 hours.  </p><p>Metabolism and Excretion</p><p>In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de-esterification to PPAA, which has little or no pharmacologic activity. In adults the metabolism of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride once daily as evaluated by metabolism to PPAA is similar to that of methylphenidate three times daily.  </p><p>The metabolism of single and repeated once-daily doses of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride is similar.</p><p>After oral dosing of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite was PPAA, accounting for approximately 80% of the dose.  </p><p>Food Effects</p><p>In patients, there were no differences in either the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamic performance of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride when administered after a high-fat breakfast. There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food.  </p><p>Alcohol Effect</p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study was conducted to explore the effect of alcohol on the release characteristics of methylphenidate from the Methylphenidate Hydrochloride 18 mg tablet dosage form.
