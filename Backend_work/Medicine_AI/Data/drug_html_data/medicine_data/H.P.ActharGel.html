</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for H.P. Acthar Gel</h2><h3>Infantile Spasms</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms in infants and children under 2 years of age.</p><h3>Multiple Sclerosis</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel is indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults. Controlled clinical trials have shown Acthar Gel to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis. However, there is no evidence that it affects the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease.</p><h3>Rheumatic Disorders</h3><p class="First">As adjunctive therapy for short-term administration (to tide the patient over an acute episode or exacerbation) in: Psoriatic arthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (selected cases may require low-dose maintenance therapy); Ankylosing spondylitis.</p><h3>Collagen Diseases</h3><p class="First">During an exacerbation or as maintenance therapy in selected cases of: systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic dermatomyositis (polymyositis).</p><h3>Dermatologic Diseases</h3><p class="First">Severe erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p><h3>Allergic States</h3><p class="First">Serum sickness.</p><h3>Ophthalmic Diseases</h3><p class="First">Severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes involving the eye and its adnexa such as: keratitis; iritis, iridocyclitis, diffuse posterior uveitis and choroiditis, optic neuritis, chorioretinitis; anterior segment inflammation.</p><h3>Respiratory Diseases</h3><p class="First">Symptomatic sarcoidosis.</p><h3>Edematous State</h3><p class="First">To induce a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome without uremia of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus erythematosus.</p><h2>H.P. Acthar Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Specific Recommended Dosage Regimen for Infantile Spasms in Infants and Children Under 2 Years of Age</h3><p class="First">In the treatment of infantile spasms, Acthar Gel must be administered intramuscularly. The recommended regimen is a daily dose of 150 U/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (divided into twice daily intramuscular injections of 75 U/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) administered over a 2-week period. Dosing with Acthar Gel should then be gradually tapered over a 2-week period to avoid adrenal insufficiency. The following is one suggested tapering schedule: 30 U/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in the morning for 3 days; 15 U/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in the morning for 3 days; 10 U/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in the morning for 3 days; and 10 U/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every other morning for 6-days.</p><p>Acthar Gel is typically dosed based on body surface area (BSA). For calculation of body surface area, use the following formula</p><p></p><h3>Recommended Dosage Regimen for the Treatment of Acute Exacerbations in Adults with Multiple Sclerosis</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose is daily intramuscular or subcutaneous doses of 80-120 units for 2-3 weeks for acute exacerbations.</p><p>Dosage should be individualized according to the medical condition of each patient. Frequency and dose of the drug should be determined by considering the severity of the disease and the initial response of the patient.</p><p>Although drug dependence does not occur, sudden withdrawal of Acthar Gel after prolonged use may lead to adrenal insufficiency or recurrent symptoms which make it difficult to stop the treatment. It may be necessary to taper the dose and increase the injection interval to gradually discontinue the medication.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage Regimen for Other Indications for Adults and Children Over 2 Years of Age</h3><p class="First">Dosage should be individualized according to the disease under treatment and the general medical condition of each patient. Frequency and dose of the drug should be determined by considering severity of the disease and the initial response of the patient.</p><p>The usual dose of Acthar Gel is 40-80 units given intramuscularly or subcutaneously every 24-72 hours.</p><p>Although drug dependence does not occur, sudden withdrawal of Acthar Gel after prolonged use may lead to adrenal insufficiency or recurrent symptoms which make it difficult to stop the treatment. It may be necessary to taper the dose and increase the injection interval to gradually discontinue the medication.</p><h3>Preparation</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel should be warmed to room temperature before using.</p><p>Caution should be taken not to over-pressurize the vial prior to withdrawing the product.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">5 mL multi-dose vial containing 80 USP Units per mL.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Acthar Gel is contraindicated:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>for intravenous administration.</li>
<li>in infants under 2 years of age who have suspected congenital infections.</li>
<li>with concomitant administration of live or live attenuated vaccines in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of Acthar Gel.</li>
<li>in patients with scleroderma, osteoporosis, systemic fungal infections, ocular herpes simplex, recent surgery, history of or the presence of a peptic ulcer, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, primary adrenocortical insufficiency, adrenocortical hyperfunction, or sensitivity to proteins of porcine origin.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">The adverse effects of Acthar Gel are related primarily to its steroidogenic effects. Not all of the adverse events described below have been seen after treatment with Acthar Gel, but they might be expected to occur because they are steroidogenic effects <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].</span></p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel may increase the risks related to infections with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic infections. Patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should be observed closely, and if therapy is prolonged, chemoprophylaxis should be instituted.</p><h3>Cushing's Syndrome and Adrenal Insufficiency Upon Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Treatment with Acthar Gel can cause hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome. These conditions should be monitored especially with chronic use.</p><p>Suppression of the HPA may occur following prolonged therapy with the potential for adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of the medication. Patients should be monitored for signs of insufficiency such as weakness, hyperpigmentation, weight loss, hypotension and abdominal pain.</p><p>The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency in infants treated for infantile spasms can be difficult to identify. The symptoms are non-specific and may include anorexia, fatigue, lethargy, weakness, excessive weight loss, hypotension and abdominal pain. It is critical that parents and caregivers be made aware of the possibility of adrenal insufficiency when discontinuing Acthar Gel and should be instructed to observe for, and be able to recognize, these symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><p>The recovery of the adrenal gland may take from days to months so patients should be protected from the stress (e.g., trauma or surgery) by the use of corticosteroids during the period of stress.</p><p>The adrenal insufficiency may be minimized in adults and infants by tapering of the dose when discontinuing treatment.</p><p>Signs or symptoms of Cushing's syndrome may occur during therapy but generally resolve after therapy is stopped. Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms such as deposition of adipose tissue in characteristics sites (e.g., moon face, truncal obesity), cutaneous striae, easy bruisability, decreased bone mineralization, weight gain, muscle weakness, hyperglycemia, and hypertension.</p><h3>Elevated Blood Pressure, Salt and Water Retention, and Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium and calcium. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. Caution should be used in the treatment of patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, or renal insufficiency.</p><h3>Vaccination</h3><p class="First">Administration of live or live attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of Acthar Gel. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered; however, the response to such vaccines can not be predicted. Other immunization procedures should be undertaken with caution in patients who are receiving Acthar Gel, especially when high doses are administered, because of the possible hazards of neurological complications and lack of antibody response.</p><h3>Masking Symptoms of Other Diseases</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel often acts by masking symptoms of other diseases/disorders without altering the course of the other disease/disorder. Patients should be monitored carefully during and for a period following discontinuation of therapy for signs of infection, abnormal cardiac function, hypertension, hyperglycemia, change in body weight and fecal blood loss.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Perforation and Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel can cause GI bleeding and gastric ulcer. There is also an increased risk for perforation in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders. Signs of gastrointestinal perforation, such as peritoneal irritation, may be masked by the therapy. Use caution where there is the possibility of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infections, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and active or latent peptic ulcer.</p><h3>Behavioral and Mood Disturbances</h3><p class="First">Use of Acthar Gel may be associated with central nervous system effects ranging from euphoria, insomnia, irritability (especially in infants), mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated. These effects are reversible once Acthar Gel therapy is stopped.</p><h3>Comorbid Diseases</h3><p class="First">Patients with a comorbid disease may have that disease worsened. Caution should be used when prescribing Acthar Gel in patients with diabetes and myasthenia gravis.</p><h3>Ophthalmic Effects</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of Acthar Gel may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi and viruses.</p><h3>Immunogenicity Potential</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel is immunogenic. Limited available data suggest that a patient may develop antibodies to Acthar Gel after chronic administration and loss of endogenous ACTH and Acthar Gel activity. Prolonged administration of Acthar Gel may increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Use in patients with sensitivity to porcine protein is contraindicated, and the possibility of sensitivity should be considered during the course of treatment should symptoms arise.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Hypothyroidism or Liver Cirrhosis</h3><p class="First">There is an enhanced effect in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis of the liver.</p><h3>Negative Effects on Growth and Physical Development</h3><p class="First">Long-term use of Acthar Gel may have negative effects on growth and physical development in pediatric patients. Changes in appetite are seen with Acthar Gel therapy, with the effects becoming more frequent as the dose or treatment period increases. These effects are reversible once Acthar Gel therapy is stopped. Growth and physical development of pediatric patients on prolonged therapy should be carefully monitored.</p><h3>Decrease in Bone Density</h3><p class="First">Decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption both through an effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function may occur. These, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone (secondary to an increase in protein catabolism) and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in children and adolescents and to the development of osteoporosis at any age. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (i.e., postmenopausal women) before initiating therapy, and bone density should be monitored in patients on long term therapy.</p><h3>Use in Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel has been shown to have an embryocidal effect. Apprise women of potential harm to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><p>Please refer to <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions in Infants and Children Under 2 Years of Age (Section 6.1)</span> for consideration when treating patients with infantile spasms. The adverse reactions presented in Section 6.2 are primarily provided for consideration in use in adults and in children over 2 years of age, but these adverse reactions should also be considered when treating infants and children under 2 years of age.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Infants and Children Under 2 Years of Age</span></p><p>While the types of adverse reactions seen in infants and children under age 2 treated for infantile spasms are similar to those seen in older patients, their frequency and severity may be different due to the very young age of the infant, the underlying disorder, the duration of therapy and the dosage regimen. Below is a summary of adverse reactions specifically tabulated from source data derived from retrospective chart reviews and clinical trials in children under 2 years of age treated for infantile spasms. The number of patients in controlled trials at the recommended dose was too few to provide meaningful incidence rates or to permit a meaningful comparison to the control groups. The most common adverse reactions (5% or greater in the recommended twice daily dosing group) for the treatment of infantile spasms are increased risk of infections, convulsions, hypertension, irritability, and pyrexia.</p><p>These adverse reactions may also be seen in adults and children over 2 years of age when treated for other purposes and with different doses and regimens.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Acthar Gel.</p><p>Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Allergic Reactions</span></p><p>Allergic responses have presented as dizziness, nausea, and shock (adults only).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular</span></p><p>Necrotizing angitis (adults only) and congestive heart failure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dermatologic</span></p><p>Skin thinning (adults only), facial erythema, and increased sweating (adults only).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Endocrine</span></p><p>Decreased carbohydrate tolerance (infants only), hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal</span></p><p>Pancreatitis (adults only), abdominal distention, and ulcerative esophagitis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions</span></p><p>Injection site reaction and asthenic conditions (including fatigue, malaise, asthenia, and lethargy).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infections and Infestations</span></p><p>Abscess.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Investigations</span></p><p>Blood glucose increased.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolic</span></p><p>Hypokalemic alkalosis (infants only) and fluid retention (including peripheral swelling).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal</span></p><p>Muscle weakness and vertebral compression fractures (infants only).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Neurological</span></p><p>Headache (adults only), vertigo (adults only), subdural hematoma, intracranial hemorrhage (adults only), and reversible brain shrinkage (usually secondary to hypertension) (infants only).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Disorders</span></p><p>Insomnia.</p><h3>Possible Additional Steroidogenic Effects</h3><p class="First">Based on steroidogenic effects of Acthar Gel certain adverse events may be expected due to the pharmacological effects of corticosteroids. The adverse events that may occur but have not been reported for Acthar Gel are:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dermatologic</span></p><p>Impaired wound healing, petechiae and ecchymoses, and suppression of skin test reactions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolic</span></p><p>Negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism and alteration in glucose tolerance.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal</span></p><p>Loss of muscle mass and aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Neurological</span></p><p>Increased intracranial pressure with papilledema, (pseudo-tumor cerebri) usually after treatment, and subdural effusion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ophthalmic</span></p><p>Exophthalmos.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Formal drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed.</p><p>Acthar Gel may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with diuretic therapy.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Class C: Acthar Gel has been shown to have an embryocidal effect. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Acthar Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Acthar Gel, when treating a nursing mother, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, considering the risk and benefit to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Acthar Gel is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms in infants and children less than 2 years of age. Both serious and other adverse reactions can occur in this population <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>The efficacy of Acthar Gel for the treatment of infantile spasms in infants and children less than 2 years of age was evaluated in a randomized, single blinded (video EEG interpreter blinded) clinical trial and an additional active control supportive trial <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. A responding patient was defined as having both complete cessation of spasms and elimination of hypsarrhythmia.</p><p>Safety in the pediatric population for infantile spasms was evaluated by retrospective chart reviews and data from non-sponsor conducted clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. While the types of adverse reactions seen in infants and children under 2 years of age treated for infantile spasms are similar to those seen in older patients, their frequency and severity may be different due to the very young age of the infant, the underlying disorder, the duration of therapy and the dosage regimen. Effects on growth are of particular concern <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span>. Serious adverse reactions observed in adults may also occur in children <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</p><h2>H.P. Acthar Gel Description</h2><p class="First">Acthar Gel is a naturally sourced complex mixture of adrenocorticotropic hormone analogs and other pituitary peptides. The Acthar Gel manufacturing process converts the initial porcine pituitary extract with low ACTH content into a mixture having modified porcine ACTH and other related peptide analogs solubilized in gelatin. A major component in the formulated complex mixture is N-25 deamidated porcine ACTH (1-39).</p><p>Acthar Gel is supplied as a sterile preparation in 16% gelatin to provide a prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Acthar Gel also contains 0.5% phenol, not more than 0.1% cysteine (added), sodium hydroxide and/or acetic acid to adjust pH and water for injection.</p><h2>H.P. Acthar Gel - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of Acthar Gel in the treatment of infantile spasms is unknown.</p><p>Acthar Gel and endogenous ACTH stimulate the adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, and a number of weakly androgenic substances. Prolonged administration of large doses of Acthar Gel induces hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex and continuous high output of cortisol, corticosterone and weak androgens. The release of endogenous ACTH is under the influence of the nervous system via the regulatory hormone released from the hypothalamus and by a negative corticosteroid feedback mechanism. Elevated plasma cortisol suppresses ACTH release.</p><p>Acthar Gel is also reported to bind to melanocortin receptors.</p><p>The trophic effects of endogenous ACTH and Acthar Gel on the adrenal cortex are not well understood beyond the fact that they appear to be mediated by cyclic AMP.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">ACTH rapidly disappears from the circulation following its intravenous administration; in people, the plasma half-life is about 15 minutes. The pharmacokinetics of Acthar Gel have not been adequately characterized.</p><p>The maximal effects of a trophic hormone on a target organ are achieved when optimal amounts of hormone are acting continuously. Thus, a fixed dose of Acthar Gel will demonstrate a linear increase in adrenocortical secretion with increasing duration for the infusion.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in animals. Human use has not been associated with an increase in malignant disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of Acthar Gel as a treatment for infantile spasms was demonstrated in a single blinded (video EEG interpreter blinded) clinical trial in which patients were randomized to receive either a 2 week course of treatment with Acthar Gel (75 U/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intramuscular twice daily) or prednisone (1 mg/kg by mouth twice daily). The primary outcome was a comparison of the number of patients in each group who were treatment responders, defined as a patient having complete suppression of both clinical spasms and hypsarrhythmia on a full sleep cycle video EEG performed 2 weeks following treatment initiation, rated by an investigator blinded to treatment. Thirteen of 15 patients (86.7%) responded to Acthar Gel as compared to 4 of 14 patients (28.6%) given prednisone (p&lt;0.002). The 2-week treatment was followed by a 2-week period of taper. Nonresponders to the prednisone treatment were eligible to receive Acthar Gel treatment. Seven of 8 patients (87.5%) responded to Acthar Gel after not responding to prednisone. Similarly, the 2 nonresponder patients from the Acthar Gel treatment were eligible to receive treatment with prednisone. One of the 2 patients (50%) responded to the prednisone treatment after not responding to Acthar Gel.</p><p>A supportive single-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing high-dose, long-duration treatment (150 U/m<span class="Sup">2</span> once daily for 3 weeks, n=30) of Acthar Gel with low-dose, short-duration treatment (20 U once daily for 2 weeks, n=29) for the treatment of infantile spasms was also evaluated in infants and children less than 2 years of age. Nonresponders (defined as in the previously described study) in the low-dose group received a dose escalation at 2 weeks to 30 U once daily. Nominal statistical superiority of the high dose treatment, as compared to the low dose treatment, was observed for cessation of spasms but not for the resolution of hypsarrhythmia.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED / STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First">Acthar Gel (repository corticotropin injection) is supplied as 5 mL multi-dose vial (NDC 63004-8710-1) containing 80 USP Units per mL.
