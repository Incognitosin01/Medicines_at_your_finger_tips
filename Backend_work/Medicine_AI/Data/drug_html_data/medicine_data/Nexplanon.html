This medication also causes changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>Nexplanon is radiopaque implant used as contraception to prevent pregnancy. Etonogestrel is contained in a small plastic rod that is implanted into the skin of your upper arm. The medicine is released slowly into the body.</p><p>The Nexplanon rod can remain in place and provide continuous contraception for up to 3 years.</p><p>Nexplanon implants contain a small amount of barium sulfate so that the implant can be seen by X-ray.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Nexplanon if you are pregnant or if you have recently had a baby.</b></p><p><b>You should not use a Nexplanon implant if you have:</b> undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease or liver cancer, if you will be having major surgery, or if you have ever had a heart attack, a stroke, a blood clot, or cancer of the breast, uterus/cervix, or vagina.</p><p>Using a Nexplanon implant can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> You should not smoke while using a Nexplanon implant.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Using a Nexplanon implant can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack. You are even more at risk if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or if you are overweight. Your risk of stroke or blood clot is highest during your first year of using this medicine.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> Your risk increases the older you are and the more you smoke.</p><p><b>Do not use if you are pregnant.</b> If you become pregnant, the Nexplanon implant should be removed if you plan to continue the pregnancy.</p><p>You may need to have a negative pregnancy test before receiving the implant.</p><p>You should not use hormonal birth control if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a history of heart attack, stroke, or blood clot;</p>
</li>
<li>

Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</p><h2>How is the Nexplanon implant used?</h2><p>Nexplanon is inserted through a needle (under local anesthesia) into the skin of your upper arm, just inside and above the elbow. After the implant is inserted, your arm will be covered with 2 bandages. Remove the top bandage after 24 hours, but leave the smaller bandage on for 3 to 5 days. Keep the area clean and dry.</p><p>The timing of when you receive the Nexplanon implant depends on whether you were using birth control before, and what type it was.</p><p>You should be able to feel the implant under your skin. Tell your doctor if you cannot feel the implant at any time while it is in place.</p><p>The Nexplanon implant can remain in place for up to 3 years. If the implant is placed correctly, you will not need to use back-up birth control. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>You may have irregular and unpredictable periods while using Nexplanon. Tell your doctor if your periods are very heavy or long-lasting, or if you miss a period (you may be pregnant).</p><p><b>If you need major surgery or will be on long-term bed rest, or if you need medical tests,</b> may need to have your Nexplanon implant removed for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you have a Nexplanon implant.</p><p>Have regular physical exams and mammograms, and self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis while using this medicine.</p><p>The Nexplanon implant must be removed by the end of the third year after it was inserted and may be replaced at that time with a new implant. After the implant is removed, your ability to get pregnant will return quickly. If the implant is not replaced with a new one, start using another form of birth control right away if you wish to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if it feels like the Nexplanon implant may be bent or broken while it is in your arm.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Nexplanon is given as an implant by a healthcare professional, you will not be on a frequent dosing schedule. Be sure to see your doctor for removal of the implant by the end of the third year.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>If the implant is correctly inserted, an overdose of etonogestrel is highly unlikely.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p><b>You should not smoke while using a Nexplanon implant.</b></p><p>Nexplanon will not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases--including HIV and AIDS.
