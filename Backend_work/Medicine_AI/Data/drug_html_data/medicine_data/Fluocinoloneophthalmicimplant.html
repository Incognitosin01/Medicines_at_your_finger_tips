Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How is the fluocinolone ophthalmic implant put into place?</h2><p>A healthcare provider will surgically place the implant in your eye. If both eyes will be treated, your implants will most likely be placed at two separate times, to decrease your risk of infection in both eyes at the same time.</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe other medications to help control the pressure inside your eyes. Increased pressure inside the eye (also called ocular hypertension) can damage the optic nerve and lead to permanent blindness. You may need to continue using these other medications for several weeks.</p><p>Use all medications as directed by your doctor. Read the medication guide or patient instructions provided with each medication. Do not change your doses or stop using your medications without your doctor's advice.</p><p>You may have a temporary decrease in vision. Call your doctor if your vision does not return to normal with 4 weeks after your implant was put in place.</p><p>Your eyes will need to be checked on a regular basis.</p><p>Fluocinolone ophthalmic implant will not correct vision problems you had before receiving the implant, such as near-sightedness or far-sightedness.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since the fluocinolone ophthalmic implant is surgically put into place, you will not be on a dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since the fluocinolone implant contains a specific amount of the medication, you are not likely to receive an overdose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving a fluocinolone ophthalmic implant?</h2><p> fluocinolone ophthalmic implant may cause blurred vision and may impair your reactions.
