<span class="Bold">A final dilution must never be performed with a sodium chloride solution or other chloride-containing solutions.</span><br/>
The solution must be further diluted in an infusion solution of 250 to 500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP.<br/>
After dilution with 250 to 500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, the shelf life is <span class="Bold">6 hours at room temperature [20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F)] or up to 24 hours under refrigeration [2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F)].</span> After final dilution, protection from light is not required.</p><p>Oxaliplatin injection is incompatible in solution with alkaline medications or media (such as basic solutions of 5-fluorouracil) and must not be mixed with these or administered simultaneously through the same infusion line. <span class="Bold">The infusion line should be flushed with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP prior to administration of any concomitant medication.</span><br/>
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration and discarded if present.</p><p>Needles or intravenous administration sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with oxaliplatin injection should not be used for the preparation or mixing of the drug. Aluminum has been reported to cause degradation of platinum compounds.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oxaliplatin injection, USP is supplied in single-dose vials containing 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg of oxaliplatin as a sterile, preservative-free, aqueous solution at a concentration of 5 mg/mL.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Oxaliplatin injection should not be administered to patients with a history of known allergy to oxaliplatin injection or other platinum compounds <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">See boxed warning</p><p>Grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, to oxaliplatin injection has been observed in 2 to 3% of colon cancer patients. These allergic reactions which can be fatal, can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle, and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum-containing compounds, such as rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and, rarely, bronchospasm and hypotension. The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> . Drug-related deaths associated with platinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported.</p><h3>Neurologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Neuropathy</span></p><p>Oxaliplatin injection is associated with two types of neuropathy:</p><p><span class="Bold">An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing.</span> The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received oxaliplatin injection with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the oxaliplatin injection with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6.</p><p>An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1 to 2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of oxaliplatin injection because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">A persistent (&gt;14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias, hypoesthesias, but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception).</span> These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receiving oxaliplatin injection with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of oxaliplatin injection.</p><p>In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows:</p><p>Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the oxaliplatin injection combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3). At the 28-day follow-up after the last treatment cycle, 60% of all patients had any grade (Grade 1=40%, Grade 2=16%, Grade 3=5%) peripheral sensory neuropathy decreasing to 39% at 6 months follow-up (Grade 1=31%, Grade 2=7%, Grade 3=1%) and 21% at 18 months of follow-up (Grade 1=17%, Grade 2=3%, Grade 3=1%).</p><p>In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2.0 (see below).</p><p>Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome</span></p><p>Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (&lt; 0.1%) and postmarketing experience. Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache, altered mental functioning, seizures, abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness, associated or not with hypertension <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> . Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging.</p><h3>Severe Neutropenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41 to 44% of patients with colorectal cancer treated with oxaliplatin injection in combination with 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin compared to 5% with 5-FU plus leucovorin alone. Sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock have been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin injection, including fatal outcomes <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> .<br/>
Delay oxaliplatin injection until neutrophils are ≥ 1.5 x 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L. Withhold oxaliplatin injection for sepsis or septic shock. Dose reduce oxaliplatin injection after recovery from Grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span> .</span></p><h3>Pulmonary Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Oxaliplatin injection has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (&lt;1% of study patients), which may be fatal. The combined incidence of cough and dyspnea was 7.4% (any grade) and &lt;1% (grade 3) with no grade 4 events in the oxaliplatin injection plus infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 4.5% (any grade) and no grade 3 and 0.1% grade 4 events in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone arm in adjuvant colon cancer patients. In this study, one patient died from eosinophilic pneumonia in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm. The combined incidence of cough, dyspnea and hypoxia was 43% (any grade) and 7% (grade 3 and 4) in the oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm compared to 32% (any grade) and 5% (grade 3 and 4) in the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of unknown duration for patients with previously untreated colorectal cancer. In case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as non-productive cough, dyspnea, crackles, or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, oxaliplatin injection should be discontinued until further pulmonary investigation excludes interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Hepatotoxicity as evidenced in the adjuvant study, by increase in transaminases (57% vs. 34%) and alkaline phosphatase (42% vs. 20%) was observed more commonly in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm than in the control arm. The incidence of increased bilirubin was similar on both arms. Changes noted on liver biopsies include: peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Hepatic vascular disorders should be considered, and if appropriate, should be investigated in case of abnormal liver function test results or portal hypertension, which cannot be explained by liver metastases <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Cardiovascular Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes have been reported in postmarketing experiences following oxaliplatin injection administration. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating oxaliplatin injection and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid oxaliplatin injection in patients with congenital long QT syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</span></p><h3>Rhabdomyolysis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Rhabdomyolysis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with oxaliplatin injection. Discontinue oxaliplatin injection if any signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis occur. <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</span></p><h3>Use in Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category D</p><p>Oxaliplatin injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of oxaliplatin injection in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with oxaliplatin injection. <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Recommended Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each oxaliplatin injection cycle <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)].</span></p><p>There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with oxaliplatin injection. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin Injection and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer</span></span></p><p>One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with oxaliplatin injection in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span> The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the oxaliplatin injection combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving oxaliplatin injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin injection are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin injection is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased.</p><p>The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the oxaliplatin injection combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the oxaliplatin injection combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the oxaliplatin injection combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture.</p><p>The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences ≥ 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences ≥ 1%.</p><p>The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the oxaliplatin injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences ≥ 5% but with incidences &lt;1% NCI grade 3/4 events.</p><p>Although specific events can vary, the overall frequency of adverse reactions was similar in men and women and in patients &lt;65 and ≥65 years. However, the following grade 3/4 events were more common in females: diarrhea, fatigue, granulocytopenia, nausea and vomiting. In patients ≥65 years old, the incidence of grade 3/4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race. The following additional adverse reactions, were reported in ≥2% and &lt;5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency): pain, leukopenia, weight decrease, coughing.</p><p>The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar; 62 in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1.96% in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm and 0.98% in infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. In addition, the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1.4% in the oxaliplatin injection combination arm as compared to 0.7% in the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm.

Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions. When oxaliplatin injection is administered in combination with 5-fluorouracil, the incidence of these events is increased.</p><p>The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study, regardless of causality, was 3% with the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3% with oxaliplatin injection plus irinotecan. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2.3% with the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination, 5.1% with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, and 3.1% with oxaliplatin injection plus irinotecan.<br/>

The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below.<br/>
Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm and 18% in the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal, or hematologic adverse reactions, or neuropathies. Both 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin injection are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions.

No pharmacokinetic interaction between 85 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin has been observed in patients treated every 2 weeks. Increases of 5-fluorouracil plasma concentrations by approximately 20% have been observed with doses of 130 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> oxaliplatin injection dosed every 3 weeks. Because platinum-containing species are eliminated primarily through the kidney, clearance of these products may be decreased by coadministration of potentially nephrotoxic compounds; although, this has not been specifically studied <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category D</p><p>Based on direct interaction with DNA, oxaliplatin injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of oxaliplatin injection in pregnant women. Reproductive toxicity studies in rats demonstrated adverse effects on fertility and embryo-fetal development at maternal doses that were below the recommended human dose based on body surface area. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant and use effective contraception while receiving treatment with oxaliplatin injection.</p><p>Pregnant rats were administered oxaliplatin at less than one-tenth the recommended human dose based on body surface area during gestation days 1 to 5 (pre-implantation), 6 to 10, or 11 to 16 (during organogenesis). Oxaliplatin caused developmental mortality (increased early resorptions) when administered on days 6 to 10 and 11 to 16 and adversely affected fetal growth (decreased fetal weight, delayed ossification) when administered on days 6 to 10. Administration of oxaliplatin to male and female rats prior to mating resulted in 97% post-implantation loss in animals that received approximately one-seventh the recommended human dose based on the body surface area.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether oxaliplatin injection or its derivatives are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from oxaliplatin injection, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of oxaliplatin in children has not been established. Oxaliplatin has been tested in 2 Phase 1 and 2 Phase 2 trials in 235 patients ages 7 months to 22 years with solid tumors (see below) and no significant activity observed.</p><p>In a Phase 1/2 study, oxaliplatin was administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks (1 cycle), for a maximum of 6 cycles, to 43 patients with refractory or relapsed malignant solid tumors, mainly neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. Twenty eight pediatric patients in the Phase 1 study received oxaliplatin at 6 dose levels starting at 40 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> with escalation to 110 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was sensory neuropathy at the 110 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> dose. Fifteen patients received oxaliplatin at a dose of 90 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> intravenous in the Phase 2 portion of the study. At this dose, paresthesia (60%, G3/4: 7%), fever (40%, G3/4: 7%) and thrombocytopenia (40%, G3/4: 27%) were the main adverse reactions. No responses were observed.</p><p>In a second Phase 1 study, oxaliplatin was administered to 26 pediatric patients as a 2-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks (1 cycle) at 5 dose levels starting at 100 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> with escalation to 160 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>, for a maximum of 6 cycles. In a separate cohort, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> was administered on day 1 every 2 weeks, for a maximum of 9 doses. Patients had metastatic or unresectable solid tumors mainly neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma. No responses were observed. The DLT was sensory neuropathy at the 160 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> dose. Based on these studies, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> as a 2-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks (1 cycle) was used in subsequent Phase II studies. A dose of 85 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> on day 1 every 2 weeks was also found to be tolerable.</p><p>In one Phase 2 study, 43 pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory embryonal CNS tumors received oxaliplatin 130 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> every 3 weeks for a maximum of 12 months in absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. In patients &lt; 10 kg the oxaliplatin dose used was 4.3 mg/kg. The most common adverse reactions reported were leukopenia (67%, G3/4: 12%), anemia (65%, G3/4: 5%), thrombocytopenia (65%, G3/4: 26%), vomiting (65%, G3/4: 7%), neutropenia (58%, G3/4: 16%) and sensory neuropathy (40%, G3/4: 5%). One partial response was observed.</p><p>In a second Phase 2 study, 123 pediatric patients with recurrent solid tumors, including neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma or peripheral PNET, ependymoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, hepatoblastoma, high grade astrocytoma, Brain stem glioma, low grade astrocytoma, malignant germ cell tumor and other tumors of interest received oxaliplatin 130 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> every 3 weeks for a maximum of 12 months or 17 cycles. In patients &lt;12 months old the oxaliplatin dose used was 4.3 mg/kg.

Oxaliplatin is an organoplatinum complex in which the platinum atom is complexed with 1,2-diaminocyclohexane(DACH) and with an oxalate ligand as a leaving group.</p><p>The molecular weight is 397.3. Oxaliplatin is slightly soluble in water at 6 mg/mL, very slightly soluble in methanol, and practically insoluble in ethanol and acetone.<br/></p><p>Oxaliplatin injection, USP is supplied in vials containing 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg of oxaliplatin as a sterile, preservative-free, aqueous solution at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. Water for Injection, USP is present as an inactive ingredient.</p><h2>Oxaliplatin Concentrate Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Oxaliplatin undergoes nonenzymatic conversion in physiologic solutions to active derivatives via displacement of the labile oxalate ligand. Several transient reactive species are formed, including monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum, which covalently bind with macromolecules. Both inter- and intrastrand Pt-DNA crosslinks are formed. Crosslinks are formed between the <span class="Italics">N7</span> positions of two adjacent guanines (GG), adjacent adenine-guanines (AG), and guanines separated by an intervening nucleotide (GNG). These crosslinks inhibit DNA replication and transcription. Cytotoxicity is cell-cycle nonspecific.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vivo</span> studies have shown antitumor activity of oxaliplatin against colon carcinoma. In combination with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin exhibits <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> antiproliferative activity greater than either compound alone in several tumor models [HT29 (colon), GR (mammary), and L1210 (leukemia)].</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The reactive oxaliplatin derivatives are present as a fraction of the unbound platinum in plasma ultrafiltrate. The decline of ultrafilterable platinum levels following oxaliplatin administration is triphasic, characterized by two relatively short distribution phases (t <span class="Sub">1/2α</span>; 0.43 hours and t <span class="Sub">1/2β</span>; 16.8 hours) and a long terminal elimination phase (t <span class="Sub">1/2γ</span>; 391 hours). Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained after a single 2-hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin injection at a dose of 85 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> expressed as ultrafilterable platinum were C <span class="Sub">max</span> of 0.814 mcg/mL and volume of distribution of 440 L.<br/>
Interpatient and intrapatient variability in ultrafilterable platinum exposure (AUC <span class="Sub">0–48hr</span>) assessed over 3 cycles was moderate to low (23% and 6%, respectively). A pharmacodynamic relationship between platinum ultrafiltrate levels and clinical safety and effectiveness has not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></span></p><p>At the end of a 2-hour infusion of oxaliplatin injection, approximately 15% of the administered platinum is present in the systemic circulation. The remaining 85% is rapidly distributed into tissues or eliminated in the urine. In patients, plasma protein binding of platinum is irreversible and is greater than 90%. The main binding proteins are albumin and gamma-globulins. Platinum also binds irreversibly and accumulates (approximately 2-fold) in erythrocytes, where it appears to have no relevant activity. No platinum accumulation was observed in plasma ultrafiltrate following 85 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> every two weeks.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></span></p><p>Oxaliplatin undergoes rapid and extensive nonenzymatic biotransformation.

At five days after a single 2-hour infusion of oxaliplatin injection, urinary elimination accounted for about 54% of the platinum eliminated, with fecal excretion accounting for only about 2%. Platinum was cleared from plasma at a rate (10 to 17 L/h) that was similar to or exceeded the average human glomerular filtration rate (GFR; 7.5 L/h). There was no significant effect of gender on the clearance of ultrafilterable platinum. The renal clearance of ultrafilterable platinum is significantly correlated with GFR.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric</span></p><p><span class="Italics">[See Use In Specific Patient Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>A study was conducted in 38 patients with advanced GI cancer and varying degrees of renal impairment.

No P450-mediated drug-drug interactions are therefore anticipated in patients. Since platinum-containing species are eliminated primarily through the kidney, clearance of these products may be decreased by co-administration of potentially nephrotoxic compounds, although this has not been specifically studied.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin was not mutagenic to bacteria (Ames test) but was mutagenic to mammalian cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay).

A dose of 2 mg/kg/day (less than one-seventh the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) did not affect pregnancy rate, but caused developmental mortality (increased early resorptions, decreased live fetuses, decreased live births) and delayed growth (decreased fetal weight).</p><p>Testicular damage, characterized by degeneration, hypoplasia, and atrophy, was observed in dogs administered oxaliplatin at 0.75 mg/kg/day x 5 days every 28 days for three cycles. A no effect level was not identified. This daily dose is approximately one-sixth of the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Combination Adjuvant Therapy with oxaliplatin injection and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer</h3><p class="First">An international, multicenter, randomized study compared the efficacy and evaluated the safety of oxaliplatin injection in combination with an infusional schedule of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin to infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, in patients with stage II (Dukes’ B2) or III (Dukes’ C) colon cancer who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor. The primary objective of the study was to compare the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) in patients receiving oxaliplatin injection and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin to those receiving 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. Patients were to be treated for a total of 6 months (i.e., 12 cycles). A total of 2246 patients were randomized; 1123 patients per study arm. Patients in the study had to be between 18 and 75 years of age, have histologically proven stage II (T <span class="Sub">3</span>-T <span class="Sub">4</span> N0 M0; Dukes’ B2) or III (any T N <span class="Sub">1-2</span> M0; Dukes’ C) colon carcinoma (with the inferior pole of the tumor above the peritoneal reflection, i.e., ≥15 cm from the anal margin) and undergone (within 7 weeks prior to randomization) complete resection of the primary tumor without gross or microscopic evidence of residual disease. Patients had to have had no prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy, and have an ECOG performance status of 0,1, or 2 (KPS ≥ 60%), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.5x 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L, platelets ≥100x 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L, serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 x ULN total bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN, AST/ALT &lt; 2 x ULN and carcino-embyrogenic antigen (CEA) &lt; 10 ng/mL.

The study had 7 arms at different times during its conduct, four of which were closed due to either changes in the standard of care, toxicity, or simplification. During the study, the control arm was changed to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. The results reported below compared the efficacy and safety of two experimental regimens, oxaliplatin injection in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and a combination of oxaliplatin injection plus irinotecan, to an approved control regimen of irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in 795 concurrently randomized patients previously untreated for locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. After completion of enrollment, the dose of irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin was decreased due to toxicity. Patients had to be at least 18 years of age, have known locally advanced, locally recurrent, or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma not curable by surgery or amenable to radiation therapy with curative intent, histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma, measurable or evaluable disease, with an ECOG performance status 0,1, or 2. Patients had to have granulocyte count ≥ 1.5 x 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L, platelets ≥ 100 x 10 <span class="Sup">9</span>/L, hemoglobin ≥9.0 gm/dL, creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN, total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, AST ≤ 5 x ULN, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN. Patients may have received adjuvant therapy for resected Stage II or III disease without recurrence within 12 months. The patients were stratified for ECOG performance status (0, 1 vs. 2), prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no), prior immunotherapy (yes vs. no), and age (&lt;65 vs. ≥65 years). Although no post study treatment was specified in the protocol, 65 to 72% of patients received additional post study chemotherapy after study treatment discontinuation on all arms. Fifty-eight percent of patients on the oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm received an irinotecan-containing regimen and 23% of patients on the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm received oxaliplatin-containing regimens. Oxaliplatin was not commercially available during the trial.</p><p>The following table presents the dosing regimens of the three arms of the study.</p><p>The following table presents the demographics of the patient population entered into this study.</p><p>The length of a treatment cycle was 2 weeks for the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen; 6 weeks for the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen; and 3 weeks for the oxaliplatin injection plus irinotecan regimen. The median number of cycles administered per patient was 10 (23.9 weeks) for the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen, 4 (23.6 weeks) for the irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen, and 7 (21.0 weeks) for the oxaliplatin injection plus irinotecan regimen. Patients treated with the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination had a significantly longer time to tumor progression based on investigator assessment, longer overall survival, and a significantly higher confirmed response rate based on investigator assessment compared to patients given irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. The following table summarizes the efficacy results.</p><p>Figure 4 illustrates the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the comparison of oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination and oxaliplatin injection plus irinotecan to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin.</p><p>A descriptive subgroup analysis demonstrated that the improvement in survival for oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin compared to irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin appeared to be maintained across age groups, prior adjuvant therapy, and number of organs involved. An estimated survival advantage in oxaliplatin injection plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin versus irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin was seen in both genders; however it was greater among women than men. Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis by race.</p><h3>Combination Therapy with oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer</h3><p class="First">A multicenter, open-label, randomized, three-arm controlled study was conducted in the US and Canada comparing the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin injection in combination with an infusional schedule of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin to the same dose and schedule of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone and to single agent oxaliplatin in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who had relapsed/progressed during or within 6 months of first-line therapy with bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and irinotecan. The study was intended to be analyzed for response rate after 450 patients were enrolled. Survival will be subsequently assessed in all patients enrolled in the completed study. Accrual to this study is complete, with 821 patients enrolled. Patients in the study had to be at least 18 years of age, have unresectable, measurable, histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma, with a Karnofsky performance status &gt;50%. Patients had to have SGOT(AST) and SGPT(ALT) ≤2x the institution’s upper limit of normal (ULN), unless liver metastases were present and documented at baseline by CT or MRI scan, in which case ≤5x ULN was permitted. Patients had to have alkaline phosphatase ≤2x the institution’s ULN, unless liver metastases were present and documented at baseline by CT or MRI scan, in which cases ≤5x ULN was permitted. Prior radiotherapy was permitted if it had been completed at least 3 weeks before randomization.<br/>
The dosing regimens of the three arms of the study are presented in the table below.</p><p>Patients entered into the study for evaluation of response must have had at least one unidimensional lesion measuring ≥20mm using conventional CT or MRI scans, or ≥10mm using a spiral CT scan. Tumor response and progression were assessed every 3 cycles (6 weeks) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) until radiological documentation of progression or for 13 months following the first dose of study drug(s), whichever came first. Confirmed responses were based on two tumor assessments separated by at least 4 weeks.<br/>
The demographics of the patient population entered into this study are shown in the table below.</p><p>The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 for the oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination and 3 each for 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone and oxaliplatin injection alone.</p><p>Patients treated with the combination of oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin had an increased response rate compared to patients given 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or oxaliplatin alone. The efficacy results are summarized in the tables below.</p><p>At the time of the interim analysis 49% of the radiographic progression events had occurred. In this interim analysis an estimated 2-month increase in median time to radiographic progression was observed compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone.</p><p>Of the 13 patients who had tumor response to the combination of oxaliplatin injection and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, 5 were female and 8 were male, and responders included patients &lt;65 years old and ≥65 years old. The small number of non-Caucasian participants made efficacy analyses in these populations uninterpretable.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>16.
