Because CYP3A4 inhibition elevates the serum levels of dihydroergotamine, the risk for vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities is increased.

It is a nasal solution used to help relieve migraine headaches. Nasal dihydroergotamine is not an ordinary pain reliever. It will not relieve any kind of pain other than throbbing headaches.</p><p>Nasal dihydroergotamine may cause blood vessels in the body to constrict (become narrower). This action can lead to serious effects that are caused by a decrease in the flow of blood (blood circulation) to many parts of the body. Be sure that you discuss with your doctor the risks of using this medicine as well as the good it can do.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Migranal</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Migranal</h2><p>It is important to use this medicine properly. Make sure that you read the patient directions carefully before using this medicine.</p><p>Do not use nasal dihydroergotamine for a headache that is different from your usual migraine. Instead, check with your doctor.</p><p>To relieve your migraine as soon as possible, use nasal dihydroergotamine as soon as the headache begins. Even if you get warning signals of a coming migraine (an aura), you should wait until the headache pain starts before using nasal dihydroergotamine.</p><p>Lying down in a quiet, dark room for a while after you use this medicine may help relieve your migraine.</p><p>If you feel much better after a dose of nasal dihydroergotamine, but your headache comes back or gets worse after a while, you may use more nasal dihydroergotamine. However, use this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, and do not use it more often, than directed.</p><p>Your doctor may direct you to take another medicine to help prevent headaches. It is important that you follow your doctor's directions, even if your headaches continue to occur. Headache-preventing medicines may take several weeks to start working. Even after they do start working, your headaches should occur less often, and they should be less severe, and easier to relieve. This can reduce the amount of nasal dihydroergotamine or other pain medicines that you need. If you do not notice any improvement after several weeks of headache-preventing treatment, check with your doctor.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
