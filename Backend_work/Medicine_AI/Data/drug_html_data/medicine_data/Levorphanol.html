Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p><b>Ask a doctor before using opioid medicine if you are breastfeeding.</b> Tell your doctor if you notice severe drowsiness or slow breathing in the nursing baby.</p><p>Levorphanol is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><h2>How should I take levorphanol?</h2><p>Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use levorphanol in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to take more of  levorphanol.</p><p>Your dose needs may be different if you recently used opioid medicine and your body is tolerant to it (ask your doctor if you're not sure).</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.</p><p>Do not stop using levorphanol suddenly after long-term use, or you could have serious withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Never crush or break a levorphanol pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. Doing so could result in death.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of your medicine. You should be aware if anyone is using it improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush the unused medicine down the toilet.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since levorphanol is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An opioid overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include severe drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, slow breathing, or no breathing.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you get naloxone (a medicine to reverse an opioid overdose) and keep it with you at all times. A person caring for you can give the naloxone if you stop breathing or don't wake up. Your caregiver must still get emergency medical help and may need to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on you while waiting for help to arrive.</p><p>Anyone can buy naloxone from a pharmacy or local health department. Make sure any person caring for you knows where you keep naloxone and how to use it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking levorphanol?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how  levorphanol will affect you. Dizziness or drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Levorphanol side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Opioid medicine can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur. A person caring for you should give naloxone and/or seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
