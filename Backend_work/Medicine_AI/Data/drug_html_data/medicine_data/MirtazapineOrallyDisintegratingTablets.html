</ul><h3>Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating treatment with Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span></p><h3>Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant</h3><p class="First">At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h3>Dosage Modifications Due to Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strong CYP3A Inducers</span></p><p>An increase in dosage of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets may be needed with concomitant strong CYP3A inducer (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) use. Conversely, a decrease in dosage of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets may be needed if the CYP3A inducer is discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Strong CYP3A Inhibitors</span></p><p>A decrease in dosage of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets may be needed with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin).

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are contraindicated in patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including the MAOIs linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)].</span></li>
<li>With a known hypersensitivity to mirtazapine or to any of the excipients in Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous dermatitis, erythema multiforme and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported following the use of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets<span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions 6.2].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults</h3><p class="First">In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1.</p><p>It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.</p><p>Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication of clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.</p><h3>Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="First">In premarketing clinical trials, 2 (1 with Sjögren's Syndrome) out of 2796 patients treated with mirtazapine developed agranulocytosis [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>with associated signs and symptoms, e.g., fever, infection, etc.] and a third patient developed severe neutropenia (ANC &lt;500/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>without any associated symptoms). For these 3 patients, onset of severe neutropenia was detected on days 61, 9, and 14 of treatment, respectively. All 3 patients recovered after mirtazapine was stopped. If a patient develops a sore throat, fever, stomatitis, or other signs of infection, along with a low white blood cell (WBC) count, treatment with Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be discontinued and the patient should be closely monitored.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonergic antidepressants, including Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).</p><p>The concomitant use of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets, discontinue Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p>Monitor all patients taking Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</p><h3>Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets, may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.</p><h3>QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes</h3><p class="First">The effect of mirtazapine on QTc interval was assessed in a clinical randomized trial with placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controls involving 54 healthy volunteers using exposure response analysis. This trial showed a positive relationship between mirtazapine concentrations and prolongation of the QTc interval. However, the degree of QT prolongation observed with both 45 mg and 75 mg (1.67 times the maximum recommended daily dose) doses of mirtazapine was not at a level generally considered to be clinically meaningful. During postmarketing use of mirtazapine, cases of QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death, have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>. The majority of reports occurred in association with overdose or in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation, including concomitant use of QTc-prolonging medicines <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Overdosage (10)]</span>. Exercise caution when Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other drugs thought to prolong the QTc interval.</p><h3>Increased Appetite and Weight Gain</h3><p class="First">In U.S. controlled clinical studies, appetite increase was reported in 17% of patients treated with mirtazapine, compared to 2% for placebo. In these same trials, weight gain of ≥7% of body weight was reported in 7.5% of patients treated with mirtazapine, compared to 0% for placebo. In a pool of premarketing U.S. clinical studies, including many patients for long-term, open-label treatment, 8% of patients receiving mirtazapine discontinued for weight gain.</p><p>In an 8-week-long pediatric clinical trial of doses between 15 to 45 mg/day, 49% of mirtazapine-treated pediatric patients had a weight gain of at least 7%, compared to 5.7% of placebo-treated patients. The safety and effectiveness of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets in pediatric patients with MDD have not been established <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Somnolence</h3><p class="First">In U.S. controlled studies, somnolence was reported in 54% of patients treated with mirtazapine, compared to 18% for placebo. In these studies, somnolence resulted in discontinuation for 10.4% of mirtazapine-treated patients, compared to 2.2% for placebo. It is unclear whether tolerance develops to the somnolent effect of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Because of the potentially significant effect of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets on impairment of performance, caution patients about engaging in activities that require alertness, including operating hazardous machinery and motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets do not affect them adversely. The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and alcohol with Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be avoided <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Activation of Mania or Hypomania</h3><p class="First">In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.2% of patients treated with mirtazapine. Prior to initiating treatment with Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets have not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. In premarketing clinical trials, 1 seizure was reported among the 2796 U.S. and non-U.S. patients treated with mirtazapine. Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.</p><h3>Elevated Cholesterol and Triglycerides</h3><p class="First">In U.S. controlled studies, nonfasting cholesterol increases to ≥20% above the upper limits of normal were observed in 15% of patients treated with mirtazapine, compared to 7% for placebo. In these same studies, nonfasting triglyceride increases to ≥500 mg/dL were observed in 6% of patients treated with mirtazapine, compared to 3% for placebo.</p><h3>Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with serotonergic antidepressants, including Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).</p><p>In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Transaminase Elevations</h3><p class="First">Clinically significant ALT (SGPT) elevations (≥3 times the upper limit of the normal range) were observed in 2.0% (8/424) of patients treated with mirtazapine in a pool of short-term, U.S. controlled trials, compared to 0.3% (1/328) of placebo patients. While some patients were discontinued for the ALT increases, in other cases, the enzyme levels returned to normal despite continued mirtazapine treatment. Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Discontinuation Syndrome</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of adverse reactions upon the discontinuation of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets (particularly when abrupt), including but not limited to the following: dizziness, abnormal dreams, sensory disturbances (including paresthesia and electric shock sensations), agitation, anxiety, fatigue, confusion, headache, tremor, nausea, vomiting, and sweating, or other symptoms which may be of clinical significance.</p><p>A gradual reduction in the dosage, rather than an abrupt cessation, is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><h3>Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness</h3><p class="First">Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets have not been systematically evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or other significant heart disease. Mirtazapine was associated with significant orthostatic hypotension in early clinical pharmacology trials with normal volunteers. Orthostatic hypotension was infrequently observed in clinical trials with depressed patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease that could be exacerbated by hypotension (history of myocardial infarction, angina, or ischemic stroke) and conditions that would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medication).</p><h3>Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets contain the following amount of phenylalanine: 3.22 mg per 15 mg orally disintegrating tablet, 6.44 mg per 30 mg orally disintegrating tablet, and 9.66 mg per 45 mg orally disintegrating tablet. Before prescribing Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are described in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below are from clinical trials in which Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets were administered to 2796 patients in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. The trials consisted of double-blind controlled and open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed dose, and titration studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment</span></p><p>Approximately 16% of the 453 patients who received mirtazapine in U.S. 6-week placebo-controlled clinical trials discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared to 7% of the 361 placebo-treated patients in those studies. The most common reactions leading to discontinuation (≥1% and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are included in Table 2.</p><p><span class="Bold">Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and twice placebo) associated with the use of mirtazapine are listed in Table 3.</p><p>Table 4 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in ≥1% of mirtazapine-treated patients, and were more frequent than the placebo-treated patients, who participated in 6-week, U.S. placebo-controlled trials in which patients were dosed in a range of 5 to 60 mg/day. This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least 1 episode of an adverse reaction at some time during their treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">ECG Changes</span></p><p>The electrocardiograms for 338 patients who received mirtazapine and 261 patients who received placebo in 6-week, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Mirtazapine was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 3.4 bpm, compared to 0.8 bpm for placebo. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of</span> <span class="Bold">Mirtazapine</span> The following list does not include reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general or excessively specific so as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.</p><p>Adverse reactions are categorized by body system according to the following definitions: <span class="Italics">frequent</span> adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients;

Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney (75%), and the risk of decreased clearance of this drug is greater in patients with impaired renal function. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance of mirtazapine in the elderly <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Sedating drugs, including Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets, may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. Caution is indicated when administering Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets to elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11), (5.14) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be conservative, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal or Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The clearance of mirtazapine is reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment. Consequently, plasma mirtazapine levels may be increased in these patient groups, compared to levels observed in patients without renal or hepatic impairment.

Mirtazapine has a tetracyclic chemical structure and belongs to the piperazino-azepine group of compounds. It is designated 1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro-2 methylpyrazino [2,1-a] pyrido [2,3-c][2] benzazepine and has the molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>. Its molecular weight is 265.35. The structural formula is the following and it is the racemic mixture:</p><p>Mirtazapine, USP is a white or slightly yellow powder which is practically insoluble in water.</p><p>Mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablet is available for oral administration as an orally disintegrating tablet containing 15, 30, or 45 mg of mirtazapine. Mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: aspartame, alpha-tocopherol, citric acid anhydrous, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, maltodextrin, povidone and sodium stearyl fumarate.</p><h2>Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of mirtazapine for the treatment of major depressive disorder, is unclear. However, its efficacy could be mediated through its activity as an antagonist at central presynaptic α<span class="Sub">2 </span>adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors and enhancing central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In preclinical studies, mirtazapine acts as an antagonist at α<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptors. Mirtazapine has no significant affinity for the 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B</span> receptors.</p><p>Mirtazapine also acts as an antagonist of histamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span>) receptors, peripheral α<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptors, and muscarinic receptors. Actions at these receptors may explain some of the other clinical effects of mirtazapine (e.g., its prominent somnolent effects and orthostatic hypotension may be explained by its inhibition of histamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span>) receptors and peripheral α<span class="Sub">1</span>-adrenergic receptors, respectively).</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of mirtazapine on QTc interval was assessed in healthy subjects. At a dose of 75 mg (1.67 times the maximum recommended dosage), mirtazapine does not prolong the QTc interval to a clinically meaningful extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Plasma levels of mirtazapine are linearly related to dose over a dose range of 15 to 80 mg (1.78 times the maximum recommended dose). Steady state plasma levels of mirtazapine are attained within 5 days, with about 50% accumulation (accumulation ratio=1.5). The (–) enantiomer has an elimination half-life that is approximately twice as long as the (+) enantiomer and therefore achieves plasma levels that are about 3 times as high as that of the (+) enantiomer.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Mirtazapine has an absolute bioavailability of about 50% following oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations of mirtazapine are reached within about 2 hours post dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></p><p>The presence of food in the stomach has a minimal effect on both the rate and extent of absorption.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Mirtazapine is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.01 to 10 mcg/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Mirtazapine has a half-life of about 20 to 40 hours following oral administration of Mirtazapine Orally Disintegrating Tablets.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Mirtazapine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. Major pathways of bio-transformation are demethylation and hydroxylation followed by glucuronide conjugation. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data from human liver microsomes indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the formation of the 8-hydroxy metabolite of mirtazapine, whereas CYP3A is considered to be responsible for the formation of the N-desmethyl and N-oxide metabolite. Several unconjugated metabolites possess pharmacological activity but are present in the plasma at very low levels.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Mirtazapine and its metabolites are eliminated predominantly (75%) via urine with 15% in feces.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>Following oral administration of mirtazapine tablets 20 mg/day for 7 days to subjects of varying ages (range 25 to 74 years old), oral clearance of mirtazapine was reduced in the elderly compared to the younger subjects.

Patients were titrated with mirtazapine from a dose range of 5 mg to 35 mg/day. The mean mirtazapine dose for patients who completed these 4 studies ranged from 21 to 32 mg/day. Overall, these studies demonstrated mirtazapine to be superior to placebo on at least 3 of the following 4 measures: 21-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score; HDRS Depressed Mood Item; CGI Severity score; and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Superiority of mirtazapine over placebo was also found for certain factors of the HDRS, including anxiety/somatization factor and sleep disturbance factor.</p><p>Examination of age and gender subsets of the population did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings.</p><p>In a longer-term study, patients meeting (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder who had responded during an initial 8 to 12 weeks of acute treatment on mirtazapine were randomized to continuation of mirtazapine or placebo for up to 40 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as having achieved a HAM-D 17 total score of ≤8 and a CGI-Improvement score of 1 or 2 at 2 consecutive visits beginning with week 6 of the 8 to 12 weeks in the open-label phase of the study. Relapse during the double-blind phase was determined by the individual investigators. Patients receiving continued mirtazapine treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 40 weeks compared to those receiving placebo.
