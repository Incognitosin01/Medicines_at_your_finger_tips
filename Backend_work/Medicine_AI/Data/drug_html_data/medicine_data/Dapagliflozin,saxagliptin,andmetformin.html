Dapagliflozin works in the kidneys to prevent absorption of glucose (blood sugar). This helps lower the blood sugar level. Saxagliptin helps to control blood sugar levels by making the pancreas gland release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar when there is too much sugar in the blood. Metformin reduces the absorption of sugar from the stomach, reduces the release of stored sugar from the liver, and helps your body use sugar better. Dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin does not help patients who have insulin-dependent or type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetic patients must use insulin injections.</p><p>Dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Under certain conditions, too much metformin can cause a serious condition called lactic acidosis. <i>The symptoms of lactic acidosis are severe and appear quickly</i>. Lactic acidosis usually occurs when other serious health problems are present, such as a heart attack or kidney failure. The symptoms of lactic acidosis include: abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast or shallow breathing, a general feeling of discomfort, muscle pain or cramping, and unusual sleepiness, tiredness, or weakness. <i>If you have more than one of these symptoms together, you should get immediate emergency medical help</i>.</p><p>Limit how much alcohol you drink while using dapagliflozin, saxagliptin, and metformin.

If you are a woman of childbearing potential, you should discuss birth control options with your doctor.</p><p>There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes.
