Concentrated (U-500) insulin is a long-acting insulin that starts to work several hours after injection and keeps working evenly for 24 hours. U-500 insulin is five times more concentrated than regular U-100 insulin.</p><p>U-500 insulin is used to improve blood sugar control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus who have significant daily insulin needs (more than 200 units per day).</p><p>U-500 insulin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Never share an injection pen, cartridge, or syringe with another person, even if the needle has been changed.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use  insulin regular, concentrated if you are allergic to insulin, or if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>liver or kidney disease; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low levels of potassium in your blood (hypokalemia).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>liver or kidney disease; or</p><p>low levels of potassium in your blood (hypokalemia).</p><p>Tell your doctor if you also take pioglitazone or rosiglitazone (sometimes contained in combinations with glimepiride or metformin). Taking certain oral diabetes medicines while you are using insulin may increase your risk of serious heart problems.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about using insulin <b>if you are pregnant or you become pregnant.</b> Controlling diabetes is very important during pregnancy, and having high blood sugar may cause complications in both the mother and the baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use U-500 insulin?</h2><p>U-500 insulin is concentrated and contains 500 units of insulin in each milliliter (mL). <b>This is five times more concentrated than regular U-100 insulin, which contains 100 units per mL. Measure each dose of U-500 insulin carefully.</b> Using too much insulin can lead to insulin shock or death. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Insulin is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider can teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p><b>U-500 insulin must not be given with an insulin pump, or mixed with other insulins.</b> Do not inject U-500 insulin into a vein or a muscle.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine looks cloudy, has changed colors, or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Your healthcare provider will show you where on your body to inject U-500 insulin. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row.</p><p>Do not inject this medicine into skin that is damaged, tender, bruised, pitted, thickened, scaly, or has a scar or hard lump.</p><p>After using U-500 insulin, you should eat a meal within 30 minutes.</p><p>If you use an injection pen, use only the injection pen that comes with U-500 insulin. Attach a new needle before each use. Do not transfer the insulin from the pen into a syringe. The injection pen has a dial on it that allows you to set your correct doses of U-500 insulin.</p><p>If you use U-500 insulin from a vial (bottle), use only a U-500 insulin syringe to inject the medicine. Do not use any other type of syringe.</p><p>Do not convert your dose when using a U-500 injection pen or U-500 insulin syringe.</p><p><b>Never share an injection pen, cartridge, or syringe with another person, even if the needle has been changed.</b> Sharing these devices can allow infections or disease to pass from one person to another.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>You may have low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> and feel very hungry, dizzy, irritable, confused, anxious, or shaky. To quickly treat hypoglycemia, eat or drink a fast-acting source of sugar (fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda).</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe a glucagon injection kit in case you have severe hypoglycemia. Be sure your family or close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>U-500 insulin is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, blood sugar testing, and special medical care.
