Inactive ingredients: glycerin, propylene glycol, purified water, hypophosphorous acid, calcium hypophosphite; about 8.5% ethyl alcohol and about 0.5% benzyl alcohol.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Dermatologic Solution Tresaderm is indicated as an aid in the treatment of certain bacterial, mycotic, and inflammatory dermatoses and otitis externa in dogs and cats. Both acute and chronic forms of these skin disorders respond to treatment with Tresaderm. Many forms of dermatosis are caused by bacteria (chiefly <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>, <span class="Italics">Proteus vulgaris</span> and <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>). Moreover, these organisms often act as opportunistic or concurrent pathogens that may complicate already established mycotic skin disorders, or otoacariasis caused by <span class="Italics">Otodectes cynotis</span>. The principal etiologic agents of dermatomycoses in dogs and cats are species of the genera <span class="Italics">Microsporum</span> and <span class="Italics">Trichophyton</span>. The efficacy of neomycin as an antibacterial agent, with activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, is well documented. Detailed studies in various laboratories have verified the significant activity thiabendazole displays against the important dermatophytes. Dexamethasone, a synthetic adrenocorticoid steroid, inhibits the reaction of connective tissue to injury and suppresses the classic inflammatory manifestations of skin disease. The formulation for Tresaderm combines these several activities in a complementary form for control of the discomfort and direct treatment of dermatitis and otitis externa produced by the above-mentioned infectious agents.</p><h2>Tresaderm Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Prior to the administration of Dermatologic Solution Tresaderm, remove the ceruminous, purulent or foreign materials from the ear canal, as well as the crust which may be associated with dermatoses affecting other parts of the body. The design of the container nozzle safely allows partial insertion into the ear canal for ease of administration. The amount to apply and the frequency of treatment are dependent upon the severity and extent of the lesions. Five to 15 drops should be instilled in the ear twice daily. In treating dermatoses affecting other than the ear the surface of the lesions should be well moistened (2 to 4 drops per square inch) with Dermatologic Solution Tresaderm twice daily. The volume required will be dependent upon the size of the lesion.</p><p>Application of Tresaderm should be limited to a period of not longer than one week.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">On rare occasions dogs may be sensitive to neomycin. In these animals, application of the drug will result in erythema of the treated area, which may last 24 to 48 hours. Also, evidence of transient discomfort has been noted in some dogs when the drug was applied to fissured or denuded areas. The expression of pain may last 2 to 5 minutes. Application of Dermatologic Solution Tresaderm should be limited to periods not longer than one week.</p><p>While systemic side effects are not likely with topically applied corticosteroids, such a possibility should be considered if use of the solution is extensive and prolonged. If signs of salt and water retention or potassium excretion are noticed (increased thirst, weakness, lethargy, oliguria, gastrointestinal disturbances or tachycardia), treatment should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken to correct the electrolyte and fluid imbalance.</p><p class="First">Store in a refrigerator 36 - 46°F (2 - 8°C).</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">For topical use in dogs and cats.<br/>
