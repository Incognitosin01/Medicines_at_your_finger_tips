It causes the pituitary gland to release hormones needed to stimulate ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).</p><p>Clomiphene is used to cause ovulation in women with certain medical conditions (such as polycystic ovary syndrome) that prevent naturally occurring ovulation.</p><p>Clomiphene may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use clomiphene if you are already pregnant.</b></p><p>You should not use clomiphene if you have: liver disease, unexplained abnormal vaginal bleeding, an uncontrolled adrenal gland or thyroid disorder, an ovarian cyst (unrelated to polycystic ovary syndrome), or if you are pregnant.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use clomiphene if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>

</li>
</ul><p>endometriosis or uterine fibroids.</p><p><b>Do not use clomiphene if you are already pregnant.</b> Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about the possible effects of this medicine on a new pregnancy.</p><p>Clomiphene can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. This medication may slow breast milk production in some women. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Using clomiphene for longer than 3 treatment cycles may increase your risk of developing an ovarian tumor. Ask your doctor about your specific risk.</p><p>Higher doses of clomiphene can also lead to visual disturbances, which may be irreversible, or a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS can be a life threatening condition. Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, weight gain, and trouble breathing.</p><p>Fertility treatment may increase your chance of having multiple births (twins, triplets). These are high-risk pregnancies both for the mother and the babies. Ask your doctor about this risk.</p><h2>How should I take clomiphene?</h2><p>Use clomiphene exactly as directed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Your doctor will perform medical tests to make sure you do not have conditions that would prevent you from safely using clomiphene.</p><p>Clomiphene is usually taken for 5 days, starting on the 5th day of your menstrual period. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>You will need to have a pelvic examination before each treatment cycle. You must remain under the care of a doctor while you are using this medicine.</p><p>You will most likely ovulate within 5 to 10 days after you take clomiphene. To improve your chance of becoming pregnant, you should have sexual intercourse while you are ovulating. Follow your doctor’s instructions regarding timed intercourse.</p><p>Your doctor may have you use over-the-counter ovulation tests or check your temperature each morning and record your daily readings on a chart. This will help you determine when you can expect ovulation to occur.</p><p>In most cases, clomiphene should not be used for more than 3-6 treatment cycles (3 ovulatory cycles). If ovulation occurs but you do not get pregnant after 3 treatment cycles, your doctor may stop treatment and evaluate your infertility further.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss a dose of clomiphene.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.
