When the body develops antibodies or "inhibitors" to the clotting factor, this treatment becomes less effective in preventing bleeding episodes. Feiba works by bypassing the effects of these inhibitors to improve blood clotting and decrease the risk of bleeding.</p><p>Feiba is used to treat or prevent bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia A or B who have developed inhibitors.  Feiba is also used to control bleeding related to surgery in people with hemophilia and inhibitors. This medicine is not for treating bleeding episodes in people who do not have inhibitors.</p><p>Feiba may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Feiba may increase your risk of having a stroke or heart attack.</p><p><b>Call your doctor or seek emergency medical help right away if you have</b>--sudden numbness or weakness, sudden headache, slurred speech, chest pain, trouble breathing, sudden cough with blood, warmth or swelling in your leg.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Feiba if:</p><ul>
