</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p>Each teaspoonful (5 mL) for oral administration contains:<br/>
Chlorpheniramine Maleate ..... 4 mg<br/>
Scopolamine Methyl Nitrate ..... 1.25 mg</p><p><span class="Bold">INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:</span> Citric Acid, Grape flavor, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, Sodium Citrate, Sodium<br/>
Saccharin, and Sorbitol.</p><p>RYNEZE® LIQUID contains ingredients from the following classes: antihistamine, and anticholinergic.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an antihistamine with the chemical name: 2-Pyridinepropanamine, γ-(4-chlorphenyl)-<br/>
<span class="Italics">N,N</span>-dimethyl-, (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1), and has the following chemical structure:</p><p>Scopolamine Methyl Nitrate is an anticholinergic belldonna alkaloid derivative with the chemical name:<br/>
[7(s)-(α,2β,4β,5α,7β,)]–7–(3–hydroxy–1-oxo – 2- Phenylpropoxy)-9, 9-dimethyl–3-oxa– 9-azoniatricyclo<br/>
[3.3.1.0 2,4] nonane nitrate.It has the following chemical structure:</p><p><br/></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Chlorpheniramine maleate competitively antagonizes most of the smooth muscle stimulating actions of histamine on the<br/>
H1 receptors of the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. It also antagonizes the action of histamine<br/>
that results in increased capillary permeability and the formation of edema. Chlorpheniramine maleate is analkylamine-type antihistamine.<br/>
This group of antihistamines are among the most active histamine antagonists and are<br/>
generally effective in relatively low doses. They thereby prevent, but do not reverse, responses mediated by histamine<br/>
alone. The anticholinergic actions of most antihistamines provide a drying effect on the nasal mucosa. These drugs are<br/>
not so prone to produce drowsiness and are among the most suitable agents for daytime use, but a significant proportion<br/>
of patients do experience this effect.</p><p>Scopolamine methyl nitrate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna<br/>
alkaloids that exhibits antisecretory activity. Scopolamine methyl nitrate inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine<br/>
on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and<br/>
atrioventricular nodes, and exocrine glands. In general, the smaller doses of anticholinergics inhibit salivary and<br/>
bronchial secretions, sweating, and accommodation; cause dilation of the pupil; and may affect the heart rate.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">This product is indicated for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with seasonal and<br/>
perennial allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis.Chlorpheniramine Maleate temporarily relieves runny nose<br/>
and reduces sneezing, itching of the nose or throat, and itchy,watery eyes due to hay fever or other upper respiratory<br/>
allergies. Scopolamine Methyl Nitrate further augments the anti-secretory activity of this product.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p>This product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to any of its<br/>
ingredients. It is also contraindicated in women who are pregnant or nursing.</p><p>It is also contraindicated in newborn or premature infants, because this age group has an increased susceptibility to the<br/>
anticholinergic side effects of chlorpheniramine maleate. Geriatric patients may be more sensitive to the effects of this medication.</p><p>Risk-benefit should be considered when the following conditions exist: Acute asthma; Bladder neck obstruction;<br/>
Brain damage in children; Cardiac disease, especially cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,<br/>
and mitral stenosis; Cardiovascular disease; Diabetes mellitus; Down’s Syndrome; Esophagitis, reflux; Narrow angle<br/>
glaucoma; Acute hemorrhage with unstable cardiovascular status; Hepatic function impairment; Hernia; Hypertension;<br/>
Hyperthyroidism; Intestinal atony in the elderly or debilitated patient; Chronic lung disease; Myasthenia gravis; Autonomic<br/>
neuropathy; Paralytic ileus; Prostatic hypertrophy; Psychiatric disorders; Pyloric obstruction; Renal function impairment;<br/>
Spastic paralysis, in children; Tachycardia; Toxemia of pregnancy; Ulcerative colitis; Urinary retention, or<br/>
predisposition to; Uropathy; Xerostomia.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">This product may cause drowsiness or blurred vision. Patients taking this product should be warned not to<br/>
engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform<br/>
hazardous tasks while taking this drug.</p><p><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dosage.</span></p><p>Heat prostration can occur with the use of scopolamine methyl nitrate when the environmental temperature is high.<br/>
Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or<br/>
colostomy; in this instance, use of scopolamine methyl nitrate would be inappropriate and possibly harmful.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> Antihistamines have an atropine-like action and should be used with caution in<br/>
patients with a history of bronchial asthma, emphysema, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism,<br/>
cardiovascular disease and hypertension.</p><p>Use scopolamine methyl nitrate with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux Esophagitis. Use<br/>
extreme caution and only when needed in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart<br/>
disease, congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmia.</p><h2>Information for patients:</h2><p class="First">Patient consultation should include the following information regarding proper use of this medication:<br/>
• Do not take more medication than the amount recommended.<br/>
• This medication should be used with caution during exercise or hot weather, overheating may result in heat<br/>
stroke.<br/>
• Do not drive or operate machinery if drowsiness or dizziness occurs.<br/>
• Do not ingest alcoholic beverages, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, or CNS depression producing<br/>
medications (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers) while taking this medication.<br/>
• This medication possibly increases sensitivity of eyes to light.<br/>
• Scopolamine methyl nitrate may cause blurred vision.<br/>
• If a dose is missed, the medication should be taken as soon as possible unless it is almost time for the next<br/>
dose. Do not double dose.</p><p>Caution patients about the signs of potential side effects,<br/>
especially:<br/>
• Anticholinergic effects – clumsiness or unsteadiness;severe drowsiness; severe dryness of mouth, nose, or<br/>
throat; flushing or redness of face; shortness of breath or trouble breathing.<br/>
• Blood dyscrasias-sore throat and fever; unusual bleeding or bruising; unusual tiredness or weakness.<br/>
• Fast or irregular heartbeat.<br/>
• Psychotic episodes.<br/>
• Tightness in chest.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> When anticholinergics are given to patients, especially children, where the environmental temperature<br/>
is high there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of suppression of sweat gland<br/>
activity. Infants, patients with Down’s syndrome, and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage may show<br/>
an increased response to anticholinergics, thus increasing the potential for side effects.</p><p>Geriatric or debilitated patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation,<br/>
drowsiness, or confusion.</p><h2>Laboratory Tests:</h2><p>The following may be especially important in patient monitoring (other tests may be<br/>
warranted in some patients, depending on conditions): Blood pressure determination – recommended at<br/>
frequent intervals during therapy: Electrocardiogram (ECG) – monitoring may be required: Intraocular<br/>
pressure determination – recommended at periodic intervals, as these medications may increase the<br/>
intraocular pressure.</p><h2>Drug Interactions:</h2><p class="First">Do not take this product if you are presently taking, or have taken within the preceding<br/>
two weeks, a prescription drug for high blood pressure or depression without first consulting your physician.<br/>
Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics<br/>
due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying.</p><p>Combinations containing any of the following medications, depending on the amount present, may<br/>
also interact with this product:<br/>
• Alkalizers, such as: calcium and/or magnesium-containing antacids; Carbonic inhibitors;<br/>
citrates; sodium bicarbonate-urinary excretion of anticholinergics may be delayed by alkalization of the<br/>
urine, thus potentiating scopolamine methyl nitrate therapeutic and/or side effects.<br/>
• Antacids or adsorbent antidiarrheals-simultaneous use of these medications may reduce absorption of<br/>
scopolamine methyl nitrate, resulting in decreased therapeutic effectiveness; doses of these should be<br/>
spaced 2 or 3 hours apart from doses of scopolamine methyl nitrate.<br/>
• Anticholinergics – Concurrent use with anticholinergic effects; patients should be advised to report<br/>
occurrence of gastrointestinal problems promptly since paralytic ileus may occur with concurrent therapy.<br/>
• CNS Depressants – Concurrent use of alcohol, antihistamines with alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants,<br/>
barbiturates and other CNS depressants may have an additive effect.<br/>
• Ketoconazole – Anticholinergics may increase gastrointestinal pH, possibly resulting in a marked<br/>
reduction in ketoconazole absorption during concurrent use with anticholinergics; patients should be advised<br/>
to take these medications at least 2 hours after ketoconazole.<br/>
• MAO inhibitors – Concurrent use may prolong and intensify cardiac stimulate and vasopressor effects of<br/>
chlorpheniramine, resulting in headache, cardiac arrhythmias, vomiting or sudden and severe<br/>
hypertensive and/or hyperpyretic crisis. These medications should not be administered during<br/>
or within 14 days following the administration of MAO inhibitor therapy.<br/>
• Metoclopramide – Concurrent use of metoclopramide with anticholinergics may antagonize<br/>
metoclopramide’s effects on gastrointestinal motility.<br/>
• Potassium chloride – Concurrent use with anticholinergics may increase the severity of<br/>
potassium chloride-induced gastrointestinal lesions.</p><h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2><p>No data is available on the long-term potential of the components of this product for Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis or Impairment of Fertility in animals or humans.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Pregnancy:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Category C:</span> It is not known whether Ryneze® Liquid can cause fetal harm when administered<br/>
to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Ryneze® Liquid should be given to a pregnant<br/>
woman only if clearly needed.</p><h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2><p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted<br/>
in human milk, caution should be exercised when Ryneze Liquid is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h2>Pediatric Use:</h2><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Ryneze® Liquid in children below the age of 6 have not been established.</p><p>Use is not recommended for children under six years of age. A paradoxical reaction characterized by<br/>
hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics.</p><h2>Geriatric Use:</h2><p class="First">Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation,<br/>
drowsiness, or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects,<br/>
such as constipation, dryness of the mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). If these side effects occur<br/>
and continue or are severe, medication should probably be discontinued.</p><p>Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of<br/>
precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, with the<br/>
continued use of anticholinergics, since these drugs block the action of acetylcholine, which is responsible for<br/>
many functions of the brain, including memory function.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p>The following adverse reactions have been observed with the use of chlorpheniramine and<br/>
scopolamine methyl nitrate; Arrhytmias, blood dyscrasias, CNS depression, CNS stimulation, dizziness, drowsiness,<br/>
dryness of mouth, hallucinations, hypotension, hypertension, increased sweating, loss of appetite,<br/>
paradoxical reaction, restlessness, skin rash, stomach upset or pain, thickening of mucus, tingling in hands or<br/>
feet, trembling, troubled breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, vomiting.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> Agitation; confusion; difficult or painful urination; drowsiness; dizziness; and dryness of mouth, nose and<br/>
throat are more likely to occur in the elderly. Nightmares, unusual excitement, nervousness,<br/>
restlessness, or irritability are more likely to occur in children and the elderly. When anticholinergics are given<br/>
to patients, especially children, where the environmental temperature is high, there is risk of a rapid increase in<br/>
body temperature.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">In all cases of suspected overdose, immediately call your regional poison center and/or<br/>
contact a physician immediately. The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or induction of emesis with<br/>
syrup of ipecac. The installation of activated charcoal into he stomach also should be considered. The treatment of<br/>
overdose is essentially sypmptomatic and supportive. If respiratory depression is present treat promptly with oxygen and/or<br/>
mechanical support of ventilation. If convulsions or marked CNS excitement occurs, only short-acting benzodiazepine-type<br/>
drugs should be used.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and children 12 years of age and older:</span></p><p>1 teaspoonful (5 mL) every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 6 teaspoonfuls in 24 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Children 6 to under 12 years of age:</span> <span class="Bold"><br/></span></p><p>½ teaspoonful (2.5 mL) every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 3 teaspoonfuls in 24 hours.</p><p>RYNEZE® LIQUID is not recommended for children under 6 years of age.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span>Geriatric patients may be more sensitive to the effects of the usual adult dose.
