Insulin is a hormone that works by lowering levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Afrezza inhalation is a fast-acting insulin that starts to work about 15 minutes after inhalation, peaks in about 1 hour, and keeps working for 2 to 4 hours.</p><p>Afrezza inhalation is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>If you have type 1 diabetes, you will also need to use a long-acting injectable insulin.</p><p>If you have type 2 diabetes, Afrezza may be the only medicine you need to control your blood sugar. However, your doctor may prescribe a long-acting injectable insulin or a diabetes medicine you take by mouth.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Afrezza can cause sudden or serious lung problems.</b> You should not use this medicine if you smoke or have recently quit, or if you have chronic lung disease such as COPD or asthma.</p><h2>Before using this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Afrezza inhalation if you are allergic to insulin, or if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). <b>Afrezza inhalation can cause sudden or serious lung problems.

Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Use Afrezza at the beginning of a meal.</p><p>Afrezza inhalation is a powder contained inside a plastic cartridge that fits into the inhaler device supplied with this medicine. Only one cartridge can be placed in the inhaler device at one time. You may use each inhaler device for up to 15 days before replacing it with a new one.</p><p>Each blue cartridge of Afrezza powder is equal to 4 units of injectable insulin. Each green cartridge is equal to 8 units of injectable insulin. If your dose is more than 8 units, you will need to use more than one cartridge. Always use the least number of cartridges possible to get your correct dose. For example, if your dose is 12 units, use one 4-unit cartridge and one 8-unit cartridge to equal 12 units. For a dose of 16 units, use two 8-unit cartridges. Follow the dosing chart provided with this medicine to learn about combining cartridges to get the correct dose.</p><p>Afrezza cartridges are packaged in a plastic blister card that is sealed inside a foil package. Store each unopened foil package in a refrigerator. <b>An unopened foil package that is not refrigerated must be used within 10 days.</b></p><p>When you open the foil package, remove only the number of cartridges needed for your dose, put the rest of the blister card back into the foil package and return it to the refrigerator. <b>Leave the cartridges needed for your dose at room temperature for 10 minutes before using them</b>.</p><p>Once you have opened a foil package, you may store it at room temperature. After tearing open an individual blister-card strip, you must use the cartridges in that strip within 3 days.</p><p>While using Afrezza, your blood sugar will need to be checked often. You may also need to have lung function tests every 6 to 12 months.</p><p>Low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> can happen to everyone who has diabetes. Symptoms include headache, hunger, sweating, irritability, dizziness, nausea, fast heart rate, and feeling anxious or shaky. To quickly treat low blood sugar, always keep a fast-acting source of sugar with you such as fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda.</p><p>Your doctor can prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit to use in case you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink. Be sure your family and close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</p><p>Insulin is only part of a treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care. Follow your doctor's instructions very closely.</p><p>In case of emergency, wear or carry medical identification to let others know you have diabetes.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you forget to use your dose at the beginning of a meal, use the medicine as soon as you remember. <b>Do not</b> use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>Insulin overdose can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia.</b> Symptoms include drowsiness, confusion, blurred vision, numbness or tingling in your mouth, trouble speaking, muscle weakness, clumsy or jerky movements, seizure (convulsions), or loss of consciousness.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>Do not smoke while using Afrezza.

Some drugs can also cause you to have fewer symptoms of hypoglycemia, making it harder to tell when your blood sugar is low.
