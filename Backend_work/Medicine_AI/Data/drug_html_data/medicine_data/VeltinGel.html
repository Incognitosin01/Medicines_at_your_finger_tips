</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Veltin Gel</h2><p class="First">VELTIN™ (clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin) Gel, 1.2%/0.025% is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older.</p><h2>Veltin Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Veltin Gel should be applied once daily in the evening, gently rubbing the medication to lightly cover the entire affected area. Approximately a pea-sized amount will be needed for each application. Avoid the eyes, lips, and mucous membranes.</p><p>Veltin Gel is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Veltin Gel, containing clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025%, is a yellow, opaque topical gel. Each gram of Veltin Gel contains, as dispensed, 10 mg (1%) clindamycin as clindamycin phosphate, and 0.25 mg (0.025%) tretinoin solubilized in an aqueous-based gel.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Veltin Gel is contraindicated in patients with regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, or history of antibiotic-associated colitis.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Colitis</h3><p class="First">Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, Veltin Gel should be discontinued.</p><p>Severe colitis has occurred following oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death.</p><p>Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> and stool assay for <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> toxin may be helpful diagnostically.</p><h3>Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure</h3><p class="First">Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be avoided during the use of Veltin Gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Daily use of sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., a hat) are recommended. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with Veltin Gel.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety data reflect exposure to Veltin Gel in 1,104 subjects with acne vulgaris. Subjects were 12 years and older and were treated once daily in the evening for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions that were reported in ≥1% of subjects treated with Veltin Gel are presented in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Veltin Gel</span><br/>

In vitrostudies have shown antagonism between these 2 antimicrobials. The clinical significance of this in vitroantagonism is not known.</p><h3>Neuromuscular Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, Veltin Gel should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C.</p><p>There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with Veltin Gel. Veltin Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. A limit teratology study performed in Sprague Dawley rats treated topically with Veltin Gel or 0.025% tretinoin gel at a dose of 2 mL/kg during gestation days 6 to 15 did not result in teratogenic effects. Although no systemic levels of tretinoin were detected, craniofacial and heart abnormalities were described in drug-treated groups. These abnormalities are consistent with retinoid effects and occurred at 16 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to human exposure, the recommended clinical dose is defined as 1 g of Veltin Gel applied daily to a 50-kg person.</p><p>With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during 2 decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, 5 of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to fetus is not known.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of Veltin Gel. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. It is not known whether tretinoin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Veltin Gel is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Veltin Gel in pediatric patients younger than 12 years have not been established.</p><p>Clinical trials of Veltin Gel included 2,086 subjects aged 12 through 17 years with acne vulgaris. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14).]</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of Veltin Gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>Veltin Gel Description</h2><p class="First">VELTIN (clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin) Gel, 1.2%/0.025%, is a fixed combination of 2 solubilized active ingredients in an aqueous-based gel. Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi-synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin.</p><p>The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is methyl 7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-(1-methyl-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-4-propyl-L-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamido)-1-thio-L-<span class="Italics">threo</span>-α-D-<span class="Italics">galacto</span>-octopyranoside 2-(dihydrogen phosphate).

It is a member of the retinoid family of compounds.</p><p>The structural formula for tretinoin is represented below:</p><p>Molecular Formula: C<span class="Sub">20</span>H<span class="Sub">28</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span></p><p>Molecular Weight: 300.44</p><p>Veltin Gel contains the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous citric acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer homopolymer (type C), edetate disodium, laureth 4, methylparaben, propylene glycol, purified water, and tromethamine.</p><h2>Veltin Gel - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">In an open-label trial of 17 subjects with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, topical administration of approximately 3 grams of Veltin Gel once daily for 5 days, clindamycin concentrations were quantifiable in all 17 subjects starting from 1 hour post-dose. All plasma clindamycin concentrations were ≤5.56 ng/mL on Day 5, with the exception of 1 subject who had a maximum clindamycin concentration of 8.73 ng/mL at 4 hours post-dose. There was no appreciable increase in systemic exposure to tretinoin, as compared with the baseline value. The average tretinoin concentration across all sampling times on Day 5 ranged from 1.19 to 1.23 ng/mL compared with the corresponding baseline mean tretinoin concentration range of 1.16 to 1.30 ng/mL.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">No microbiology studies were conducted in the clinical trials with this product.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Veltin Gel or the effect of Veltin Gel on fertility. Veltin Gel was negative for mutagenic potential when evaluated in an in vitroAmes <span class="Italics">Salmonella</span> reversion assay. Veltin Gel was equivocal for clastogenic potential in the absence of metabolic activation when tested in an in vitrochromosomal aberration assay.</p><p>Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day of clindamycin (240 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability.</p><p>In a study in female SENCAR mice, papillomas were induced by topical exposure to DMBA followed by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or mezerein for up to 20 weeks. Topical application of tretinoin prior to each application of promoting agent resulted in a reduction in the number of papillomas per mouse. However, papillomas resistant to topical tretinoin suppression were at higher risk for pre-malignant progression.</p><p>Tretinoin has been shown to enhance photocarcinogenicity in properly performed specific studies, employing concurrent or intercurrent exposure to tretinoin and UV radiation. The photocarcinogenic potential of the clindamycin tretinoin combination is unknown. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should avoid exposure to sun.</p><p>The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitroAmes <span class="Italics">Salmonella</span> reversion test and an in vitrochromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both tests were negative.</p><p>In oral fertility studies in rats treated with tretinoin, the no-observed-effect-level was 2 mg/kg/day (64 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Veltin Gel, applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris, was evaluated in 12-week multi-center, randomized, blinded trials in subjects 12 years and older.</p><p>Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a 2-grade improvement from baseline to Week 12 based on the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) and a mean absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in 2 out of 3 (total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory) lesion counts. The IGA scoring scale used in all the clinical trials for Veltin Gel is as follows:</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Clear</p><p class="First">Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris.</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">Almost Clear</p><p class="First">Skin almost clear; rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink-red) requiring no further treatment in the Investigator’s opinion.</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Mild</p><p class="First">Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodulo-cystic lesions).</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Moderate</p><p class="First">Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident; several-to-many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 1 small nodulo-cystic lesion.</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">Severe</p><p class="First">Inflammatory lesions are more apparent; many comedones and papules/pustules, there may or may not be a few nodulo-cystic lesions.</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Very Severe</p><p class="First">Highly inflammatory lesions predominate; variable numbers of comedones, many papules/pustules and nodulo-cystic lesions.</p><p>In Trial 1, 1,649 subjects were randomized to Veltin Gel, clindamycin gel, tretinoin gel, and vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 17 years and 58% were females. At baseline, subjects had an average of 71 total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 25.5 lesions and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 45.1 lesions. The majority of subjects enrolled with a baseline IGA score of 3.
