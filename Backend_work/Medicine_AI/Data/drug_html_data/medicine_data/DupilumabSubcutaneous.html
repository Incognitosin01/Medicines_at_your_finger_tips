Dupilumab helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. Dupilumab will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>Dupilumab injection is also used as additional treatment for poorly controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).</p><p>Dupilumab is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using dupilumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For dupilumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to dupilumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of dupilumab injection to <i>treat asthma in children younger than 12 years of age</i>, to <i>treat atopic dermatitis in children younger than 6 years of age</i>, or to <i>treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in children</i>. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of dupilumab injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking dupilumab, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using dupilumab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of dupilumab. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Asthma attack or</li>
<li>Bronchospasm (breathing problem) or</li>
<li>Status asthmaticus (severe asthma attack)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Conjunctivitis (pink eye) or</li>
<li>Heart problems or</li>
<li>Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea of the eye)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Parasitic infection—Use with caution. It is not known if dupilumab may affect patients with this condition. Treat the infection first before using dupilumab.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of dupilumab</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you dupilumab. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the thigh, abdomen (stomach) area, or upper arm. Dupilumab may also be given at home to patients who do not need to be in a hospital or clinic. You or your caregiver may be trained to prepare and inject the medicine at home. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>Dupilumab should come with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>If you use Dupixent® at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, damaged, bruised, or scarred.</p><p>Dupilumab is available as a prefilled pen or syringe. <i>Use the prefilled pen only for adults and children 12 years of age and older</i>.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for 30 or 45 minutes before using it.</p><p>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe. It should be clear or colorless to slightly yellow. Do not use it if it is cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of dupilumab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of dupilumab. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
