The follicular phase FSH and midcycle surge of gonadotropins are inhibited. In addition, combination hormonal contraceptives produce alterations in the genital tract, including changes in the cervical mucus, rendering it unfavorable for sperm penetration even if ovulation occurs. Changes in the endometrium may also occur, producing an unfavorable environment for nidation. Combination hormonal contraceptive drugs may alter the tubal transport of the ova through the fallopian tubes. Progestational agents may also alter sperm fertility.</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p><b>Mestranol:</b> Hepatic via demethylation to ethinyl estradiol (Orme, 1983)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Contraception:</b> For the prevention of pregnancy</p><p>Limitations of use: Products containing the equivalent of estrogen 50 mcg should not be used unless medically indicated. </p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Abnormal uterine bleeding</h3><p>Based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists committee opinion on the management of acute abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-aged women, norethindrone and mestranol (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the management of abnormal uterine bleeding <sup>[ACOG 2013]</sup>.</p><h3>Dysmenorrhea</h3><p>Based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on Noncontraceptive Uses of Hormonal Contraceptives, norethindrone and mestranol (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the management of dysmenorrhea <sup>[ACOG 2010]</sup>.</p><h3>Menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)</h3><p>Based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on Noncontraceptive Uses of Hormonal Contraceptives, norethindrone and mestranol (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the management of menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) <sup>[ACOG 2010]</sup>.</p><h3>Pain associated with endometriosis</h3><p>Based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on Noncontraceptive Uses of Hormonal Contraceptives, norethindrone and mestranol (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the management of pain associated with endometriosis <sup>[ACOG 2010]</sup>.</p><h3>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women with menstrual irregularities and hirsutism/acne</h3><p>Based on the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, norethindrone and mestranol (among other oral contraceptive combinations) is effective and recommended for the treatment of menstrual irregularities and hirsutism/acne in women with PCOS <sup>[ES [Legro 2013]]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-dependent neoplasms (current or a history of), hepatic tumors (benign or malignant) or hepatic disease, pregnancy, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy, jaundice with prior combination hormonal contraceptive use</p><p>Use is also contraindicated in women at high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases, for example, women with: cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (current or history of); thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders.</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for estrogens and progestins is limited.

This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (at least 15 cigarettes daily) and is quite marked in women older than 35 years. Women who use OCs should not smoke.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Breast cancer: In women at risk for breast cancer due to family history or susceptibility genes (<i>BRCA1, BRCA2</i>), the use of combination hormonal contraceptives has not been shown to modify the risk for breast cancer. However, breast cancer is a hormonal sensitive tumor and the prognosis for women with a current or recent history of breast cancer may be worse with combination hormonal contraceptive use (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in women with (or history of) breast cancer.</p><p>• Cervical cancer: The use of combination hormonal contraceptives has been associated with a slight increased risk of cervical cancer; however, studies are not consistent and may be related to additional risk factors (Gierisch 2013). Theoretically, use may affect prognosis of existing disease. Women awaiting treatment for cervical cancer may use combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Chloasma: Combination hormonal contraceptives, as well as sun exposure and pregnancy, are triggers for chloasma. Women with a susceptibility to chloasma or additional risk factors should avoid exposure to sun or ultraviolet radiation during therapy (Handel, 2014).</p><p>• Cholestasis: Risk of cholestasis may be increased with previous cholestasis of pregnancy or cholestasis with prior oral contraceptive use; use is contraindicated with cholestatic jaundice or jaundice or pregnancy.</p><p>• Lipid effects: Combination hormonal contraceptives may adversely affect lipid levels, including serum triglycerides.</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: Discontinue if unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions occur and immediately evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis.</p><p>• Thromboembolic disorders: Discontinue use of combination hormonal contraceptives if an arterial or venous thrombotic event occurs. Oral contraceptives may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (risk is greatest during first year of use and less than the risk associated with pregnancy); some studies suggest this risk may be higher in preparations with third- or fourth-generation progestins and/or high dose ethinyl estradiol. Women with inherited thrombophilias (eg, protein C or S deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin mutation, antithrombin deficiency) may have increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Age &gt;35 years, hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use also increase the risk of thrombotic events in women taking combination hormonal contraceptives (ASRM 2017; Curtis 2016b; DeSancho 2010; van Vlijmen 2011). Combination hormonal contraceptives may also increase the risk of arterial thrombosis (eg, MI, stroke) and should not be used in women with a history of stroke or ischemic heart disease (Curtis 2016b). Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated in women with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic disease.</p><p>• Vaginal bleeding: Breakthrough or intracyclic bleeding and spotting may occur, especially during the first 3 months of therapy. In addition, occasional missed periods may occur. Presentation of irregular, unresolving vaginal bleeding warrants further evaluation to rule out malignancy or pregnancy. Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur after discontinuing combination hormonal contraceptives, especially when such a condition was preexistent.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns: </i></b></p><p>• Bariatric surgery:</p><p>– Altered absorption: Consider nonoral contraceptive options in patients who had specific bariatric procedures (Roux-en-Y, biliopancreatic diversion); malabsorptive procedures can potentially decrease absorption of oral contraceptives (Kominiarek 2017; Mechanick 2013; Schlatter 2017). It is difficult to recommend against the use of oral contraceptives in restrictive procedures (sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding) as the evidence is limited (Merki-Feld 2015).</p><p>–­ Venous thromboembolism risk: Consider discontinuation of estrogen-containing medications 30 days prior to bariatric surgery to reduce risk of venous thromboembolism; however, practice may vary based upon institutional protocols (Mechanick 2013).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, hypertension, low HDL, high LDL, high triglycerides, older age, diabetes, women who smoke); use of combination hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (Curtis 2016b). Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be contraindicated in women at high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases.</p><p>• Depression: Use with caution in patients with a history of depression; discontinue if serious depression recurs.</p><p>• Diabetes: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in women with diabetes or prediabetes. In general, use of combination oral contraceptives has limited effects on daily insulin needs and no long term effects on diabetes control in women with nonvascular disease. However, use in women with concomitant nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, other vascular disease, or diabetes &gt;20 years' duration should be evaluated for contraceptive use based on the severity of the condition (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Diseases exacerbated by fluid retention: Use with caution in patients with diseases that may be exacerbated by fluid retention.</p><p>• Endometrial or ovarian cancer: The risk of endometrial or ovarian cancer is decreased in women using combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b; Walker 2015). Oral contraceptives may be used to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer including those women with <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutations (Walker 2015). Women awaiting treatment for endometrial or ovarian cancer may use combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Gallbladder disease: Combination hormonal contraceptives may cause a small increased risk of gallbladder disease or may worsen existing gallbladder disease (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas: Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is associated with hepatic adenomas (rare); rupture may cause fatal intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Long-term use may be associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (rare). Use is contraindicated with preexisting hepatic tumors.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Combination hormonal contraceptives may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment. Discontinue if jaundice develops during therapy or if liver function becomes abnormal. Use is contraindicated in women with hepatic disease. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered in women with mild (compensated) cirrhosis but should not be used in women with severe (decompensated) cirrhosis (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hepatitis: Initiation of combination hormonal contraceptives is not recommended in women with acute viral hepatitis or during a flare. Continuation of use in women with chronic hepatitis has not been shown to increase the rate or severity of cirrhotic fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Continuation of use in women who are carriers has not been shown to trigger liver failure or severe hepatic dysfunction (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hereditary angioedema: Estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms in women with hereditary angioedema (Geng, 2013; Zuraw, 2013).</p><p>• Hypertension: The risk of hypertension may be increased with age, dose, and duration of use. Combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used in women with hypertension and vascular disease, or persistent blood pressure values ≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥100 mm Hg diastolic. The risks of use may not outweigh the benefits of treatment in women with less severe hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg systolic or 90 to 99 mm Hg diastolic) or those with hypertension that is adequately controlled (Curtis 2016a). Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, older age, smoking, diabetes) should be considered when prescribing contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Migraine: Evaluate new, recurrent, severe, or persistent headaches. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered in women who have migraines without aura (including menstrual migraines) (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Renal impairment: Women with renal disease should be encouraged to use a nonhormonal form of contraception.</p><p>• Solid organ transplant: Although data is limited, serious medical complications have been reported in women with complicated organ transplants (eg, graft failure, rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy); use of combination hormonal contraceptives is not recommended in women with complicated organ transplants (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Systemic lupus erythematosus: Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and VTE. Combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used in women with SLE who have positive (or unknown) antiphospholipid antibodies, due to an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (Curtis 2016b).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Thyroid replacement therapy: Estrogens may increase thyroid-binding globulin levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels. Women on thyroid-replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone while receiving estrogens.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Contact lens wearers: Any changes with lens tolerance or vision should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.</p><p>• Obese: Available evidence suggests efficacy of combination hormonal contraceptives may be decreased in women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; however, reductions in effectiveness are considered minimal and information is conflicting. The risk of VTE may be increased in obese women using combination hormonal contraceptives. In general, the benefits of combination hormonal contraceptives may outweigh the risks in obese women who otherwise are eligible for this method (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Pediatric: Not for use prior to menarche.</p><p>• Postmenopausal women: Use is not indicated in postmenopausal women.</p><p>• Smokers: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: The risk of cardiovascular side effects is increased in women who smoke cigarettes; risk increases with age (especially women &gt;35 years) and the number of cigarettes smoked; women who use combination hormonal contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. </b></p><p>• Surgical patients: Whenever possible, should be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to and for 2 weeks following elective surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: When initiating a combination oral contraceptive, consideration should be given to safety, effectiveness, availability and acceptance to the patient (CDC, 2013). Consider initiating with a monthly bleeding monophasic formulation containing ethinyl estradiol 30 to 35 mcg plus a progestin, and adjusting based on adverse events and patient preference (Ott, 2014).</p><p>• HIV infection protection: Combination hormonal contraceptives do not protect against HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases (Curtis 2016a; Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Assessment of pregnancy status (prior to therapy); blood pressure (prior to therapy and yearly); weight (optional; body mass index at baseline may be helpful to monitor changes during therapy); assess potential health status changes at routine visits (Curtis 2016a).</p><p>If all doses have not been taken on schedule and one menstrual period is missed, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered. If two consecutive menstrual periods are missed, assess pregnancy status before a new dosing cycle is started.</p><p>Monitor patient for vision changes; blood pressure; signs and symptoms of thromboembolic disorders; signs or symptoms of depression; glycemic control in patients with diabetes; lipid profiles in patients being treated for hyperlipidemias. Adequate diagnostic measures should be performed to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>The manufacturer states that combination hormonal contraceptives should not be started until ≥4 to 6 weeks after delivery in women who choose not to breastfeed. Due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) postpartum, combination hormonal contraceptives should not be started in any woman &lt;21 days following delivery. The risk decreases to baseline by postpartum day 42. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives in women between 21 and 42 days after delivery should take into consideration the individual woman’s risk factors for VTE (eg, age ≥35 years, previous VTE, thrombophilia, immobility, preeclampsia, transfusion at delivery, cesarean delivery, peripartum cardiomyopathy, BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, postpartum hemorrhage, smoking) (Curtis 2016b).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use is contraindicated in pregnant women. Combination hormonal contraceptives are used to prevent pregnancy; treatment should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs. In general, the use of combination hormonal contraceptives, when inadvertently used early in pregnancy, have not been associated adverse fetal or maternal effects (Curtis 2016b).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
