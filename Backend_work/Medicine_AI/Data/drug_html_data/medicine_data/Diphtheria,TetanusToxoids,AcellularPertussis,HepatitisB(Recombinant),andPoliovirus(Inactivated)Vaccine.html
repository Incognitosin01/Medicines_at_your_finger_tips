In general, simultaneous administration of all vaccines for which a patient is eligible (according to current immunization schedules/guidelines) is recommended (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). However, outpatient visits solely for vaccination should be delayed in persons in quarantine due to close contact with COVID-19 or persons who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection (regardless of symptoms); refer to the CDC's "Interim Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic" for current recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html). Additional information is available from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Immunization Action Coalition.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Consult CDC/ACIP annual immunization schedules for additional information including specific detailed recommendations for catch-up scenarios and/or care of patients with high-risk conditions. According to ACIP, doses administered ≤4 days before minimum interval or age are considered valid; however, local or state mandates may supersede this timeframe (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b>Primary immunization:</b> Infants ≥6 weeks and Children &lt;7 years: IM: 0.5 mL per dose for a total of three doses administered as follows: 2, 4, and 6 months of age in 6- to 8-week intervals (preferably 8-week intervals). Vaccination usually begins at 2 months, but may be started as early as 6 weeks of age. Preterm infants should be vaccinated according to their chronological age from birth.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Pediarix is approved for the first 3 doses of polio vaccine. Per the ACIP, polio vaccine is given at 2, 4, and 6 to 18 months of age. Use of the minimum age and minimum intervals during the first 6 months of life should only be done when the vaccine recipient is at risk for imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (shorter intervals and earlier start dates may lead to lower seroconversion) (CDC 58[30] 2009).</p><p><b>Previous</b><b> vaccination with one or more components and scheduled to receive all vaccine components: </b>Infants and Children &lt;7 years:</p><p>Hepatitis B vaccine: If previously vaccinated with 1 or 2 doses of another hepatitis B vaccine may use Pediarix to complete the 3-dose series. Not for use as birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine; infants who received a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine may receive a 3-dose series of Pediarix (total of 4 hepatitis B vaccine doses). Infants born to HBsAg-positive women should begin dosing with DTaP-HepB-IPV by age 6 to 8 weeks after receiving the single antigen hepatitis B vaccine at birth (CDC/ACIP [Schillie 2018]).</p><p>Diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP): If previously vaccinated with 1 or 2 doses of Infanrix may use Pediarix to complete the first 3 doses of the series; use of Pediarix to complete DTaP vaccination started with products other than Infanrix has not been studied.</p><p>Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV): If previously vaccinated with 1 or 2 doses of IPV may use Pediarix to complete the first 3 doses of the series.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze.

Per the manufacturer, antipyretic prophylaxis may be considered for patients at high risk for seizures. However, antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen to prevent fever prior to vaccination decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Reactions from previous pertussis vaccine: Carefully consider use in patients with history of any of the following effects from previous administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine: Fever ≥105°F (40.5°C) within 48 hours of unknown cause; seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days; persistent, inconsolable crying episodes lasting ≥3 hours and occurring within 48 hours; collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) occurring within 48 hours (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p>• Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration: Vaccine administration that is too high on the upper arm may cause shoulder injury (eg, shoulder bursitis or tendinopathy) resulting in shoulder pain and reduced range of motion following injection. Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Guillain-Barré syndrome: Use with caution if Guillain-Barré syndrome occurred within 6 weeks of prior tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p>• Neurologic disorders: According to the manufacturer, use is contraindicated in patients with, progressive neurologic disease including infantile spasms, uncontrolled seizure, or a progressive encephalopathy. ACIP guidelines recommend deferring immunization until health status can be assessed and condition stabilized (CDC/ACIP [Liang 2018]).</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</b></i></p><p>• Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible; however, vaccination should not be deferred because a specific brand name is unavailable (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; (IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p>• Pediatric: Infants born of HBsAg-positive mothers should receive monovalent hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin; infants born of HBsAg-unknown mothers should receive monovalent hepatitis B vaccine; use of the combination product to complete a series is acceptable once patient is old enough to receive (ie, &gt;6 weeks old) (CDC/ACIP [Schillie 2018]).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Aluminum: Product may contain aluminum.</p><p>• Latex: Packaging may contain natural latex rubber.</p><p>• Neomycin: Product may contain neomycin.</p><p>• Polymyxin B: Product may contain polymyxin B.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Product may contain polysorbate 80. Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p>• Yeast protein: Product may contain yeast protein.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Booster dose: Not approved for the fourth dose of the IPV series or the fourth and fifth doses of the DTaP series.</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Pediarix is not approved for use in patients &gt;5 years of age.</p><h2>More about diphtheria toxoid / hepatitis b pediatric vaccine / pertussis, acellular / poliovirus vaccine, inactivated / tetanus toxoid</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
