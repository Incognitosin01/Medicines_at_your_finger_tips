</ul><h2>Description</h2><p class="First">Each tablet contains:</p><p><br/>
Methenamine, USP ..... 81.6 mg<br/>
Monobasic Sodium Phosphate, USP ..... 40.8 mg<br/>
Methylene Blue ..... 10.8 mg<br/>
Hyoscyamine Sulfate ..... 0.12 mg</p><h2>Inactive Ingredients include:</h2><p class="First">Microcrystalline<br/>
Cellulose, Mannitol, Croscarmellose Sodium, Magnesium<br/>
Stearate, FD&amp;C Blue #1</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">HYOSCYAMINE SULFATE</span> is an alkaloid of belladonna.<br/>
Exists as a white crystalline powder. Affected by light It<br/>
is very soluble in water; freely soluble in alcohol;<br/>
practically insoluble in ether.<br/>
METHENAMINE exists as colorless, lustrous crystals or<br/>
white crystalline powder. Its solutions are alkaline to<br/>
litmus. Freely soluble in water; soluble in alcohol and in<br/>
chloroform.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">METHYLENE BLUE</span> exists as dark green crystals. It is<br/>
soluble in water and in chloroform; sparingly soluble in<br/>
alcohol.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">MONOBASIC SODIUM PHOSPHAT</span>E exists as a white<br/>
crystalline powder. Its solutions are acidic to litmus. It is<br/>
freely soluble in water and practically insoluble in<br/>
alcohol.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">This product is not an Orange Book (OB) rated<br/>
product, therefore all prescriptions using this<br/>
product shall be pursuant to state statutes as<br/>
applicable. There are no claims of bioequivalence<br/>
or therapeutic equivalence.</span></p><h2>Me NaPhos MB Hyo 1 Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HYOSCYAMINE</span> is a parasympatholytic which relaxes<br/>
smooth muscles and thus produces an antispasmodic<br/>
effect. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract<br/>
and is rapidly distributed throughout body tissues. Most<br/>
is excreted in the urine within 12 hours, 13% to 50%<br/>
being unchanged.</p><p><br/>
Its biotransformation is hepatic. Its protein binding is<br/>
moderate.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">METHENAMINE</span> degrades in an acidic urine environment<br/>
releasing formaldehyde which provides bactericidal or<br/>
bacteriostatic action. It is well absorbed from the<br/>
gastrointestinal tract. 70% to 90% reaches the urine<br/>
unchanged at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is<br/>
acidic. Within 24 hours it is almost completely (90%)<br/>
excreted; of this amount at pH 5, approximately 20% is<br/>
formaldehyde. Protein binding: some formaldehyde is<br/>
bound to substances in the urine and surrounding<br/>
tissues. Methenamine is freely distributed to body tissue<br/>
and fluids but is not clinically significant as it does not<br/>
hydrolyze at pH greater than 6.8.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">METHYLENE BLU</span>E possesses weak antiseptic properties.<br/>
It is well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and is<br/>
rapidly reduced to leukomethylene blue which is<br/>
stabilized in some combination form in the urine. 75%<br/>
is excreted unchanged.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">MONOBASIC SODIUM PHOSPHATE</span> helps to maintain an<br/>
acid pH in the urine necessary for the degradation of<br/>
methenamine.</p><h2>INDICATION AND USAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ME/NaPhos/MB/Hyo 1 Tablets</span> is indicated for the<br/>
treatment of symptoms of irritative voiding. Indicated<br/>
for the relief of local symptoms, such as hypermotility<br/>
which accompany lower urinary tract infections and as<br/>
antispasmodic. Indicated for the relief of urinary tract<br/>
symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Do not exceed recommended dosage. If rapid pulse,<br/>
dizziness, or blurring of vision occurs <span class="Bold">discontinue use<br/>
immediately.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">(Pregnancy Category C)<br/>
hyoscyamine and methenamine cross the placenta.<br/>
Studies have not been done in animals or humans. It is<br/>
not known whether <span class="Bold">ME/NaPhos/MB/Hyo 1</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Tablets</span> cause fetal harm when administered to a<br/>
pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.<br/>
<span class="Bold">ME/NaPhos/MB/Hyo 1 Tablets</span> should be given to<br/>
a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h2>Breast-feeding</h2><p class="First">problems in humans have not been documented;<br/>
however, methenamine and traces of hyoscyamine are<br/>
excreted in breast milk.</p><h2>Prolonged use</h2><p class="First">there have been no studies to establish the safety of<br/>
prolonged use in humans. No known long-term animal<br/>
studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic<br/>
potential.</p><h2>Pediatric</h2><p class="First">infants and young children are especially susceptible to<br/>
the toxic effect of the belladonna alkaloids.</p><h2>Geriatric</h2><p class="First">use with caution in elderly patients as they may respond<br/>
to usual doses of hyoscyamine with excitement,<br/>
agitation, drowsiness, or confusion.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">because of this product's effect on gastrointestinal</p><p>motility and gastric emptying, it may decrease the<br/>
absorption of other oral medications during concurrent<br/>
use such as: urinary alkalizers; thiazide diuretics (may<br/>
cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the<br/>
effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its<br/>
conversion to formaldehyde); antimuscarinics<br/>
(concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of<br/>
hyoscyamine because of secondary antimuscarinic<br/>
activities of these medications); antacids/antidiarrheals<br/>
(may reduce absorption of hyoscyamine, concurrent use<br/>
with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline<br/>
reducing effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its<br/>
conversion to formaldehyde) doses of these medications<br/>
should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of<br/>
hyoscyamine; antimyasthenics (concurrent use with<br/>
hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility);<br/>
ketoconazole (patients should be advised to take this<br/>
combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole);<br/>
monoamine oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors (concurrent use<br/>
may intensify antimuscarinic side effects, opioid<br/>
(narcotic) analgesics may result in increased risk of<br/>
severe constipation); sulfonamides (these drugs may<br/>
precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine, increasing<br/>
the danger of crystalluria).<br/>
Patients should be advised that the urine may become<br/>
blue to blue green and the feces may be discolored as a<br/>
result of the excretion of methylene blue.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiovascula</span>r – rapid pulse, flushing</p><p><br/>
