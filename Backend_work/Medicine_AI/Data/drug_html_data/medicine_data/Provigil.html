Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p><b>Provigil can make certain birth control less effective.</b> Hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings) may not be effective enough to prevent pregnancy during your treatment.

Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Provigil is not approved for use by anyone younger than 17 years old.</p><h2>How should I take Provigil?</h2><p>Take Provigil exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Modafinil may be habit-forming. <b>Never share Provigil with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.</p><p>Provigil is usually taken each morning to prevent daytime sleepiness, or 1 hour before the start of a work shift to treat work-time sleep disorders.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>You may take the tablet with or without food.</p><p>Provigil is usually given for 12 weeks or less.</p><p>If you are taking Provigil to treat sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea, you may also be treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. This machine is an air pump connected to a mask that gently blows pressurized air into your nose while you sleep. The pump does not breathe for you, but the gentle force of air helps keep your airway open to prevent obstruction.</p><p>Do not stop using your CPAP machine during sleep unless your doctor tells you to. The combination of treatment with CPAP and Provigil may be necessary to best treat your condition.</p><p>Provigil will not cure obstructive sleep apnea or treat its underlying causes. Follow your doctor's instructions about all your other treatments for this disorder.</p><p>Call your doctor if you continue to have excessive sleepiness even while taking this medicine.</p><p>Taking Provigil does not take the place of getting enough sleep.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Modafinil is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Narcolepsy:</b></p><p>200 mg orally daily in the morning</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Obstructive Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome:</b></p><p>200 mg orally daily in the morning</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Shift Work Sleep Disorder:</b></p><p>200 mg orally daily one hour prior to the start of the work shift</p><p><b>Usual Pediatric Dose for Attention Deficit Disorder:</b></p><p>Not FDA approved.<br/>
Reports of serious dermatologic adverse effects and psychiatric events has resulted in the FDA's Pediatric Advisory Committee unanimously recommending that a specific warning against the use of modafinil in children be added to the manufacturer's labeling; use only if first- and second-line treatments have failed and the benefits outweigh the risks.<br/>
Children less than 30 kg: 200-340 mg once daily<br/>
Children more than 30 kg: 300-425 mg<br/>
<br/>
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pediatric studies have utilized an 85 mg film-coated tablet (currently not commercially available) to provide these dosages. All studies utilized a titration method but varied the length of titration (3 weeks vs 7-9 days); clinical improvement was noted earlier in the shorter titration period.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Talk with your doctor about what to do if you miss a dose of Provigil.
