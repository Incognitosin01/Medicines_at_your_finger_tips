</ul><h2>Rubratope-57 Description</h2><p class="First">DESCRIPTION Rubratrope-57 diagnostic capsules for oral administration provide radioactive cyanocobalamin in which a portion of the molecules contain Co 57 in the molecular structure vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-<span class="Sup">57</span>Co. The chemical structure of cyanocobalamin is given below:</p><p>Each Rubratope-57 capsule contains approximately 18.5 to 37 kBq (0.5 to 1.0 microcurie) of cyanocobalamin Co 57; the cyanocobalamin content of each capsule will vary with the specific activity of the cyanocobalamin Co 57 used. Complete assay data are provided on the vial label.</p><h2>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2><p class="First">Cobalt 57 decays by electron capture with a physical half-life of 270.9 days.1 Photons that are useful for detection and imaging studies are listed in Table 1.</p><h3>External Radiation</h3><p class="First">The specific gamma ray constant for Co 57 is 0.96 R/hour-millicurie at 1 cm. The first half-value thickness of Pb (lead) for Co 57 is 0.006 cm. To facilitate control of the radiation exposure, a range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2. For example, the use of 1.6 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1,000.</p><h2>Rubratope-57 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">After oral administration, cyanocobalamin is normally bound by intrinsic factor and absorbed by the distal ileum. It is then bound to plasma proteins, stored in the liver, and slowly released when needed to carry out normal cellular metabolic functions. Absorbed cyanocobalamin is ultimately excreted in the urine; any cyanocobalamin not bound by intrinsic factor is excreted in the stool.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Rubratope-57</h2><p class="First">Rubratope-57 (Cyanocobalamin Co 57 Capsules) is intended for the diagnosis of pernicious anemia and as a diagnostic adjunct in other defects of intestinal vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">In the use of any radioactive material, care should be taken to insure minimum radiation exposure to the patient and occupational workers consistent with proper patient management.</p><p>Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides.</p><p>Because a large parenteral dose of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> may temporarily affect subsequent intestinal absorption and excretion of the vitamin, tests employing radioactive vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> should not be performed for at least 24 hours after either a flushing dose for the Schilling test or a therapeutic injection (1000 micrograms) of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Most antibiotics, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid, or excessive alcohol intake for longer than two weeks may result in malabsorption of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or whether this agent affects fertility in males or females.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Category C</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Cyanocobalamin Co 57 Capsules. It is also not known whether this agent can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Since vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-<span class="Sup">57</span>Co is taken up by the fetus, radiocyanocobalamin absorption tests in pregnant women should be postponed until after delivery unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Ideally, examinations using radiopharmaceuticals, especially those elective in nature, in women of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few (approximately 10) days following the onset of menses.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Since vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-<span class="Sup">57</span>Co is excreted in human milk during lactation, formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No adverse reactions specifically attributable to Cyanocobalamin Co 57 Capsules have been reported.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been reported with nonradioactive cyanocobalamin: mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, peripheral vascular thrombosis, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of the entire body, congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema, anaphylactic shock, and death.</p><h2>Rubratope-57 Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The suggested oral dose range for the average patient (70 kg) when performing a Schilling urinary excretion test is between 18.5 to 37 kBq (0.5 to 1 microcurie) of cyanocobalamin Co 57.</p><p>The patient dose in each Cyanocobalamin Co 57 Capsule should be measured by a suitable radioacttivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.</p><h3>Schilling Urinary Excretion Test1,2</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Test Procedure</span></p><p>The patient should be instructed to fast (patient may have water) for 12 hours prior to the test. Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> should not be administered orally or parenterally during the preceding 24 hours. It is important to establish the absence of any potentially interfering gamma-emitting radioisotopes in the patient’s urine prior to starting the study.</p><p>After the patient voids, administer one Rubratope- 57 (Cyanocobalamin Co 57) capsule. Inject 1000 µg non-radioactive Cyanocobalamin Injection USP intramuscularly as a flushing dose two hours following administration of the capsule. Collect and pool all urine for 24 hours and mix thoroughly. Collect an additional 24 hour sample separately if renal function is impaired or if urinary excretion is delayed.</p><p>Determine 10-minute net radioactivity counts for a 4 mL sample of urine from each excretion period, and a 4 mL sample of diluted Cobatope-57 (Cobaltous Chloride Co 57 Reference Standard Solution). The working standard is prepared by diluting 0.5 mL Cobatope-57, which contains the equivalent of 1 percent of the total radioactivity in the oral dose, with 3.5 mL of water. Calculate as follows:</p><p>                          counts per                    volume<br/>

The test should be repeated if a lower result is obtained.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Retest Procedure</span></p><p>The need for repeating a test should be carefully evaluated, especially in younger patients. A retest can be conducted four or five days following the primary test. Administer one Intrinsic Factor Concentrate capsule with a Rubratope-57 (Cyanocobalamin Co 57) capsule. Repeat all other steps of the primary procedure. Retest values greater than 9 percent are indicative of pernicious anemia; values of less than 9 percent are indicative of bacterial interference, malabsorption or ileal lesion.</p><p>An additional retest can be conducted to determine malabsorption or bacterial interference. Administer antibiotics, in lieu of Intrinsic Factor, 10 to 14 days prior to the second retest. Repeat all other steps of the primary procedure. Values greater than 9 percent are indicactive of bacterial interference; values of less than 9 percent are indicative of lack of ileal absorption sites.</p><h2>Radiation Dosimetry</h2><p class="First">The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average patient (70 kg) from an oral dose of 37 kBq (1 microcurie) of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-<span class="Sup">57</span> Co are shown in Table 4.</p><p>Method of Calculation: “S” Absorbed Dose per Unit Cumulated Activity for Selected Radionuclides and Organs, MIRD Pamphlet No. 11 (1975).</p><p>*The administration of a flushing dose of nonradioactive vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> will decrease the dose to the liver, gonads, and whole-body from Co 57 by about 30 percent.</p><h2>How is Rubratope-57 Supplied</h2><p class="First">Rubratope-57 (Cyanocobalamin Co 57 Capsules) is available in bottles of 5 and 10 capsules. Each two-piece blue/red capsule contains approximately 18.5 to 37 kBq (0.5 to 1 microcurie) at the time of calibration. Complete assay data are provided on the container.</p><h3>Also Available</h3><p class="First">Cobatope-57 (Cobaltous Chloride Co 57 Reference Standard Solution), supplied in 10 mL vials, is manufactured in companion lots to the diagnostic capsules. Cobatope-57 is intended for laboratory use only as a standard of comparison to the diagnostic capsules.
