<li><span class="Bold">NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></span></li>
</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Diclofenac Oral Solution</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac potassium for oral solution is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults (18 years of age or older).</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Diclofenac potassium for oral solution is not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine.</li>
<li>The safety and effectiveness of diclofenac potassium for oral solution have not been established for cluster headache, which is present in an older, predominantly male population.</li>
</ul><h2>Diclofenac Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Acute Treatment of Migraine</h3><p class="First">Administer one packet (50 mg) of diclofenac potassium for oral solution for the acute treatment of migraine. Empty the contents of one packet into a cup containing 1 to 2 ounces or 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 mL) of water, mix well and drink immediately.</p><p>Do not use liquids other than water.</p><p>Taking diclofenac potassium for oral solution with food may cause a reduction in effectiveness compared to taking diclofenac potassium for oral solution on an empty stomach <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. The safety and effectiveness of a second dose have not been established.</p><h3>Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Diclofenac</h3><p class="First">Different formulations of oral diclofenac (e.g., diclofenac potassium for oral solution, diclofenac sodium enteric-coated tablets, diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, or diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets) may not be bioequivalent even if the milligram strength is the same. Therefore, it is not possible to convert dosing from any other formulation of diclofenac to diclofenac potassium for oral solution.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac potassium for oral solution is available in individual packets each designed to deliver a 50 mg dose when mixed in water.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Diclofenac potassium for oral solution is contraindicated in the following patients:</span></p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to diclofenac or any components of the drug product <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.9)]</span></li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)]</span></li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction(MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac potassium for oral solution is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risk in NSAID-treated patients:</span></p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac potassium for oral solution until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of one or more liver tests may occur during therapy with diclofenac potassium for oral solution. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may persist, or may only be transient with continued therapy. Borderline elevations (less than 3 times the upper limit of the normal [ULN] range) or greater elevations of transaminases occurred in about 15% of diclofenac-treated patients. Of the markers of hepatic function, ALT (SGPT) is recommended for the monitoring of liver injury.</p><p>In clinical trials, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In an open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of the 3,700 patients and included marked elevations (&gt;8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In this open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (&gt;8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].</span></p><p>Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of NSAID therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p><p>Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac potassium for oral solution immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver-related event in patients treated with diclofenac potassium for oral solution, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac potassium for oral solution with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, certain antibiotics, antiepileptics). Caution patients to avoid taking nonprescription acetaminophen-containing products while using diclofenac potassium for oral solution.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium for oral solution, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Use NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium for oral solution, with caution in patients with hypertension. Monitor blood pressure closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><p>Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p>Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac potassium for oral solution is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac potassium for oral solution may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac potassium for oral solution. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac potassium for oral solution <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Avoid the use of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac potassium for oral solution is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span></p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac potassium is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> When diclofenac potassium for oral solution is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac potassium for oral solution at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p><p>Diclofenac potassium is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Medication Overuse Headache</h3><p class="First">Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.<br/></p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac potassium for oral solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Starting at 30 weeks gestation, diclofenac potassium for oral solution and other NSAIDs should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur. If this drug is used during this time period in pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [<span class="Italics">see Use in Special Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac potassium for oral solution has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients and any patient who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function for signs of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First"> The pharmacological activity of diclofenac potassium in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)</span>].</p><p> Discontinue diclofenac potassium for oral solution if abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen.</p><h3>Phenylketonurics</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac potassium for oral solution contains phenylalanine 22.45 mg per each 50 mg packet.<br/></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of a single dose of diclofenac potassium for oral solution was evaluated in 2 placebo-controlled trials with a total of 634 migraine patients treated with diclofenac potassium for oral solution for a single migraine headache. Following treatment with diclofenac potassium (either diclofenac potassium for oral solution or diclofenac potassium immediate-release tablets [as a control]), 5 subjects (0.8%) withdrew from the studies; following placebo exposure, 1 subject (0.2%) withdrew.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (i.e., that occurred in 1% or more of diclofenac potassium for oral solution-treated patients) and more frequent with diclofenac potassium for oral solution than with placebo were nausea and dizziness (see Table 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adverse Reactions With Incidence &gt;1% and Greater Than Placebo in Studies 1 and 2 Combined</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Diclofenac Potassium for Oral Solution</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p class="First">N=634</p><p class="First">N=646</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal</span></p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">3%</p><p class="First">2%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nervous </span><span class="Bold">System</span></p><p class="First">Dizziness</p><p class="First">1%</p><p class="First">0.5%</p><p>The most common adverse events resulting in discontinuation of patients following diclofenac potassium for oral solution dosing in controlled clinical trials were urticaria (0.2%) and flushing (0.2%). No withdrawals were due to a serious reaction.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of diclofenac or other NSAIDs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Reported With Diclofenac and Other NSAIDs</span></p><p>In patients taking diclofenac or other NSAIDs, the most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1% to 10% of patients are: GI reactions (including abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, nausea, GI ulcers [gastric/duodenal], and vomiting), abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, edema, elevated liver enzymes, headaches, increased bleeding time, pruritus, rashes, and tinnitus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Additional adverse reactions reported in patients taking NSAIDs include occasionally:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Body as a Whole:</span> Fever, infection, sepsis</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular System:</span> Congestive heart failure, hypertension, tachycardia, syncope</p><p><span class="Bold">Digestive System:</span> Dry mouth, esophagitis, gastric/peptic ulcers, gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, glossitis, hematemesis, hepatitis, jaundice</p><p><span class="Bold">Hemic and Lymphatic System:</span> Ecchymosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, melena, purpura, rectal bleeding, stomatitis, thrombocytopenia</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolic and Nutritional:</span> Weight changes</p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous System:</span> Anxiety, asthenia, confusion, depression, dream abnormalities, drowsiness, insomnia, malaise, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, tremors, vertigo</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory System:</span> Asthma, dyspnea</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and Appendages:</span> Alopecia, photosensitivity, sweating increased</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Senses:</span> Blurred vision</p><p><span class="Bold">Urogenital System:</span> Cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, interstitial nephritis, oliguria/polyuria, proteinuria, renal failure</p><p>Other adverse reactions in patients taking NSAIDs, which occur rarely, are:</p><p><span class="Bold">Body as a Whole:</span> Anaphylactic reactions, appetite changes, death</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular System:</span> Arrhythmia, hypotension, myocardial infarction, palpitations, vasculitis</p><p><span class="Bold">Digestive System:</span> Colitis, eructation, liver failure, pancreatitis</p><p><span class="Bold">Hemic and Lymphatic System:</span> Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolic and Nutritional:</span> Hyperglycemia</p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous System:</span> Convulsions, coma, hallucinations, meningitis</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory System:</span> Respiratory depression, pneumonia</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and Appendages:</span> Angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Senses:</span> Conjunctivitis, hearing impairment</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table <span class="Italics">2</span>: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with diclofenac</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clinical Impact:</span></p><ul class="Disc">

In rats, maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The effects of diclofenac potassium for oral solution on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. In rat studies, maternal exposure to NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, increased the incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from diclofenac potassium for oral solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions.

There is insufficient information available to support dosing recommendations for diclofenac potassium for oral solution in patients with hepatic insufficiency <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac potassium for oral solution is not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease. If diclofenac potassium for oral solution therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient’s renal function is advisable.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred.

There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><p>Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.</p><h2>Diclofenac Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac potassium for oral solution is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, available as a flavored powder, designed to be mixed with water prior to oral administration. Diclofenac potassium for oral solution is a white to off-white, flavored powder for oral solution packaged in individual unit dose packets.</p><p>The chemical name is 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino] benzeneacetic acid monopotassium salt. The molecular weight is 334.25. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>NKO<span class="Sub">2</span>, and it has the following structure.</p><p> </p><p>The inactive ingredients in diclofenac potassium for oral solution include: aspartame (equivalent to 22.45 mg phenylalanine), glyceryl behenate, mannitol, peppermint flavor, polacrilin potassium, and saccharin sodium.</p><h2>Diclofenac Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac potassium has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of diclofenac potassium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to intravenous administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available. In fasting volunteers, measurable plasma levels were observed within 5 minutes of dosing with diclofenac potassium for oral solution. Peak plasma levels were achieved at approximately 0.25 hour in fasting normal volunteers, with a range of 0.17 to 0.67 hours. High fat food had no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption, but there was a reduction in peak plasma levels of approximately 70% after a high fat meal. Decreased C<span class="Sub">max</span> may be associated to decreased effectiveness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac potassium is 1.3 L/kg.</p><p>Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15 to 105 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4’hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3’-hydroxy-, 4’,5-dihydroxy-and 3’-hydroxy-4’-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4’-hydroxydiclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4’-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3’-hydroxy-diclofenac. In patients with renal impairment, peak concentrations of metabolites 4’-hydroxy- and 5-hydroxydiclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Race:</span> There are no pharmacokinetic differences due to race.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span> The liver metabolizes almost 100% of diclofenac; there is insufficient information available to support dosing recommendations for diclofenac potassium for oral solution in patients with hepatic insufficiency <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment:</span></span>In patients with renal impairment (inulin clearance 60 to 90, 30 to 60, and &lt;30 mL/min; N=6 in each group), AUC values and elimination rate were comparable to those in healthy subjects<span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin:</span> When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered.
