People with a condition called hereditary angioedema do not have enough of this protein. Hereditary angioedema can cause attacks of swelling and symptoms such as stomach problems or trouble breathing.</p><p>Cinryze is used to prevent attacks of angioedema.</p><p>The Berinert brand of complement C1 esterase inhibitor is used to treat attacks of angioedema.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Cinryze if have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to complement C1 esterase inhibitor.</p><p>Before you receive Cinryze, tell your doctor if you have a history of stroke or blood clot.</p><p>Do not give this medication to a child without medical advice.</p><p>You may be shown how to use Cinryze in an IV at home.
