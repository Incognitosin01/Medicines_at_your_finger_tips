It works by helping the liver reduce levels of "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) circulating in your blood.</p><p>Repatha is used together with a low-fat diet and other cholesterol-lowering medications in people with homozygous or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (inherited types of high cholesterol). These conditions can cause high blood levels of LDL cholesterol, and can also cause plaque to build up inside your arteries.</p><p>Repatha is also used to help lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other heart complications in people with heart or blood vessel problems caused by plaque build-up or hardening in the arteries (also called atherosclerosis, or arteriosclerosis).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all your medical conditions, allergies, and all medicines you use.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Repatha if you are allergic to evolocumab.</p><p>To make sure Repatha is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.</p><p>Repatha is injected under the skin. You may be shown how to use injections at home. Do not give yourself this medicine if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes.</p><p>Repatha is usually given once a month, or once every 2 weeks. Depending on your dose amount, you may need to use up to 3 separate injections at one time. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Repatha is available in a prefilled syringe, a SureClick prefilled autoinjector, or a Pushtronex on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge. Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about your injection device, or call the manufacturer at 1-844-737-2842.</p><p>It may take up to 15 seconds to inject this medicine using a prefilled syringe or a SureClick autoinjector. If you use more than one injection at a time, be sure to finish all injections within 30 minutes.</p><p>The Pushtronex on-body infusor is a special hands-free device placed on the skin that delivers your evolocumab dose slowly. Read and carefully follow all instructions for using this product. You will need to wear the device for about 9 minutes to get the full dose. While wearing the on-body infusor, you may perform moderate activities such as walking, bending, or reaching.</p><p>Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject Repatha or place the on-body infusor. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row.</p><p>Each single-use prefilled syringe, cartridge, or injection device is for one use only. Throw away after one use, even if there is still some medicine left inside. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes. Use a puncture-proof "sharps" container (ask your pharmacist where to get one and how to throw it away). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Store Repatha in the refrigerator in its original carton and protect from light and heat. Do not freeze. Throw away any medicine that has been frozen.</p><p>Take the medicine out of the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before injecting your dose. Do not heat a syringe or injection device.</p><p>You may also store Repatha in the original carton at cool room temperature, away from light and heat. Use the medicine within 30 days if it is kept at room temperature.</p><p>Handle this medicine carefully. Dropping an injection device can cause it to break. Do not use an injection device that has been dropped onto a hard surface, even if you cannot see a break in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Do not shake this medicine. Do not use if the medicine has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p><b>You should not stop using Repatha without your doctor's advice,</b> or your LDL cholesterol levels may increase.</p><p>Repatha is only part of a complete treatment program that also includes diet, statin medication, and regular blood testing.
