Immune globulin contains antibodies that make your immune system stronger. It is used for patients who have primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura, or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). It is also used to improve muscle strength and disability in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). Immune globulin injection belongs to a group of medicines known as immunizing agents.</p><p>This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Octagam 10%</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of immune globulin injection in children. Some of the products are only used in children who are 2, 3, or 15 years of age and older, and other products are not approved for use in children. Immune globulin injection is used to treat primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established for use in <i>chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)</i> or <i>multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)</i>.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Gamastan®</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of immune globulin injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related blood clotting problems, kidney disease, or heart disease, which may require caution for patients receiving immune globulin injection.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Gamastan®</i> in the elderly. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) should not be treated with <i>Gammaked™</i> or <i>Gamunex®-C</i> that is injected under the skin (subcutaneously). Doing so may increase the risk of having a hematoma (buildup of blood under the skin).</p><p>This medicine may cause fever, chills, flushing, headaches, nausea, and vomiting, especially if you are receiving it for the first time or if you have not received it for more than 8 weeks. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms.</p><p>This medicine is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low.

Tell your doctor right away if you have stomach or back pain, dark urine, decreased urination, difficulty with breathing, an increased heart rate, tiredness, or yellow eyes or skin after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you start having chest pain, difficult, fast, or noisy breathing, blue lips and fingernails, fever, pale skin, increased sweating, coughing that sometimes produces a pink frothy sputum, trouble breathing, or swelling of the legs and ankles after receiving this medicine. These may be symptoms of a serious lung problem, including transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).</p><p>This medicine may cause blood clots. This is more likely to occur if you have a history of blood clotting problems, heart disease, or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), or if you are obese, take medicines containing estrogen, or must stay in bed for a long time because of surgery or illness. Check with your doctor right away if you suddenly have chest pain, severe headache, leg pain, or problems with vision, speech, or walking.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you start having red or dark brown urine, lower back or side pain, sudden weight gain, swollen face, arms, or legs, decreased urine output, or any problems with urination after you receive this medicine.
