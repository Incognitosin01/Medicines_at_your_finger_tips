Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p><b>Do not breast-feed</b> while you are using this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Abstral?</h2><p>Abstral dissolves under your tongue and will be absorbed by your body to help provide relief for your breakthrough cancer pain.</p><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Fentanyl can slow or stop your breathing. Never use this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Fentanyl may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away Abstral is against the law.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p><b>If you have been using another form of fentanyl (injection, skin patch, "lollipop" device), your buccal or sublingual dose may be different.</b></p><p>Abstral comes in a blister card with four blister units. Each blister unit contains an Abstral tablet. It is important that the tablet stays sealed in the blister unit until you are ready to use it.</p><p>When you get an episode of breakthrough pain, take the dose prescribed by your healthcare provider as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If your mouth is dry, take a sip of water to moisten it. Spit out or swallow the water. Dry your hands if they are wet before you handle Abstral tablets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are ready to take a tablet, pull apart one of the blister units from the blister card by tearing along the dotted lines (perforations) until it is fully separated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the blister unit is fully separated, peel back the foil starting at the unsealed area where indicated. Gently remove the tablet. Do not try to push Abstral tablets through the foil. This will damage the tablet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as you remove the Abstral tablet from the blister unit, place it on the floor of your mouth, under your tongue, as far back as you can. Do not suck, chew or swallow the tablet. Let the tablet dissolve completely. Do not drink or eat anything until the tablet has completely dissolved under your tongue and you can no longer feel it in your mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If more than one tablet is required, spread them around the floor of your mouth under your tongue.</p>

If your breakthrough pain does not get better within 30 minutes after taking the first dose of Abstral, you can take one more dose as instructed by your healthcare provider.</p><p>If your breakthrough pain does not get better after the second dose of Abstral, call your healthcare provider for instructions. Do not take another dose at this time.</p><p>Wait at least 2 hours before treating a new episode of breakthrough cancer pain with Abstral.</p><p>If you only need to take one dose of Abstral for an episode of breakthrough pain, you must wait 2 hours from the time of that dose to take a dose for new episode of breakthrough pain.</p><p>If you need to take two doses for an episode of breakthrough pain, you must wait 2 hours after the second dose to take a dose for a new episode of breakthrough pain.</p><p>It is important for you to keep taking your around-the-clock opioid pain medicine while taking Abstral.</p><p>Talk to your healthcare provider if you have more than four episodes of breakthrough cancer pain per day. The dose of your around- the-clock opioid pain medicine may need to be adjusted.</p><p>Talk to your healthcare provider if your dose of Abstral does not relieve your breakthrough cancer pain. Your healthcare provider will decide if your dose needs to be changed.</p><p>Do not stop using Abstral suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Never crush or break a Abstral tablet to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze. Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Keep your medicine in a place where others cannot get to it. Fentanyl is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Keep this medicine out of the reach of children or pets. <b>The amount of fentanyl in each sublingual tablet can be fatal to a child or pet who accidentally sucks on or swallows it.</b> Seek emergency medical attention if this happens.</p><p><b>Carefully follow disposal instructions when this medicine is no longer needed.</b> Do not keep leftover opioid medication. Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly. Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, throw away any unused Abstral tablets by removing them from the blister pack and flushing them down a toilet.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Abstral is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A fentanyl overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include extreme weakness or drowsiness, weak pulse, cold and clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, and slow breathing (breathing may stop).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Abstral?</h2><p>This medicine may impair your thinking or reactions. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Abstral will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.</p><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interact with fentanyl and lead to unwanted side effects. Avoid the use of grapefruit products while taking Abstral.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Abstral side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Abstral:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Like other narcotic medicines, fentanyl can slow your breathing.
