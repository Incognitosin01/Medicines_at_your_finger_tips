Resuscitation equipment, medication, and trained personnel should be available. An uneventful test dose does not ensure an anaphylactic-type reaction will not occur during administration of the therapeutic dose.</p><p>IM (INFeD, DexIron [Canadian product]): Use Z-track technique (displacement of the skin laterally prior to injection); injection should be deep into the upper outer quadrant of buttock; alternate buttocks with subsequent injections. Administer test dose at same recommended site using the same technique.</p><p>IV: Test dose should be administered gradually over at least 30 seconds (INFeD) or 5 minutes (DexIron [Canadian product]), or over 1 to 2 minutes (INFeD) for cancer-/chemotherapy-associated anemia (Auerbach 2004). Subsequent dose(s) may be administered undiluted at a slow gradual rate not to exceed 50 mg/minute (maximum: 100 mg).</p><p>Avoid dilutions with dextrose (increased incidence of local pain and phlebitis).</p><p><i>Total dose infusion (off-label administration):</i> A retrospective analysis in patients with iron deficiency anemia suggests that a total dose infusion of 1,000 mg (diluted in 250 mL of NS) over 1 hour (after an initial test dose) is safe and effective (Auerbach 2011). Another retrospective analysis in patients with chronic kidney disease and iron deficiency anemia administered the total dose (after the initial test dose) over 4 to 6 hours (Dossabhoy 2014). Total dose infusions may be associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects 24 to 48 hours after the infusion. In patients with cancer-/chemotherapy-associated anemia, 1 hour after the test dose, administer the balance of the dose diluted in 500 mL NS and infuse at 175 mL/hour (Auerbach 2004).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Iron Dextran Complex. Specifically, patients receiving an ACE inhibitor may be at an increased risk for anaphylactic-type reactions. Management: Follow iron dextran recommendations closely regarding both having resuscitation equipment and trained personnel on-hand prior to iron dextran administration and the use of a test dose prior to the first therapeutic dose.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Dimercaprol: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Iron Preparations.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Test Interactions</h2><p>May cause falsely elevated values of serum bilirubin and falsely decreased values of serum calcium.

Administer only where resuscitation equipment and personnel trained in detection and treatment of hypersensitivity are available during administration. Administer a test dose prior to the first therapeutic dose. If no signs/symptoms of anaphylactic-type reactions follow the test dose, administer the full therapeutic dose. Monitor for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity during infusion. Fatal reactions have occurred following a test dose and have occurred in patients who tolerated the test dose. Patients with a history of drug allergy or multiple drug allergies may be at increased risk of anaphylactic-type reactions.</b> The risk of adverse events (including life threatening) was higher with the high-molecular-weight iron dextran formulation (which is no longer commercially available) compared to low-molecular-weight iron dextran (INFeD) (Chertow 2006). Concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may also increase the risk of hypersensitivity.</p><p>• Infusion reaction: Delayed (1 to 2 days) infusion reaction (including arthralgia, back pain, chills, dizziness, fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, nausea, and/or vomiting) may occur with large doses (eg, total dose infusion) of IV iron dextran; symptoms usually subside within 3 to 4 days.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Allergies/asthma: Use with caution in patients with a significant history of allergies and/or asthma.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease; iron dextran may exacerbate cardiovascular complications.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with extreme caution in patients with serious hepatic impairment.</p><p>• Renal disease/impairment: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring iron supplementation, the IV route is preferred for hemodialysis patients; either oral iron or IV iron may be used for nondialysis and peritoneal dialysis CKD patients, although an initial 1- to 3-month trial of oral iron therapy is recommended (KDIGO 2012). Avoid use during acute kidney infection.</p><p>• Rheumatoid arthritis: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may experience acute exacerbation of joint pain and swelling.</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</b></i></p><p>• Drug-drug/drug-food interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy. Consult drug interactions database for more detailed information.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Anemia in the elderly is often caused by “anemia of chronic disease” or associated with inflammation rather than blood loss. Iron stores are usually normal or increased, with a serum ferritin &gt;50 ng/mL and a decreased total iron binding capacity. IV administration of iron dextran is often preferred over IM in the elderly secondary to a decreased muscle mass and the need for daily injections.</p><p>• Pediatric: Intramuscular iron dextran use in neonates may be associated with an increased incidence of gram-negative sepsis.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Use iron dextran only in patients where clinical and laboratory evidence has established the iron deficient state is not amenable to oral iron therapy.</b> Discontinue oral iron prior to initiating parenteral iron therapy.</p><p>• Carcinogenicity: Cases of tumor development at prior intramuscular injection sites of iron-carbohydrate complexes have been reported.</p><p>• Iron overload: Exogenous hemosiderosis may result from excess iron stores; patients with refractory anemias and/or hemoglobinopathies may be prone to iron overload with unwarranted iron supplementation.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, serum iron, TIBC; monitor for anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reaction (during test dose, for 1 hour after test dose, and during and after therapeutic dose)</p><p>Cancer patients with anemia: Monitor iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, or ferritin levels at baseline and periodically (Rizzo 2010).</p><p>Chronic kidney disease: Monitor transferrin saturation more frequently following a course of IV iron (KDIGO 2012)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Iron dextran may cross the placenta.</p><p>There is a risk of adverse maternal reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, hypotension, shock) following use of parenteral iron that may result in fetal bradycardia, especially during the second and third trimesters. Although the risk is rare, immediate treatment for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available (BSH [Pavord 2019]).</p><p>Maternal iron requirements increase during pregnancy. Adequate iron concentrations to the fetus can be maintained regardless of maternal iron status, except in severe cases of anemia (IOM 2001). Untreated iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in a pregnant patient may be associated with adverse events, including low birth weight, preterm birth, or increased perinatal mortality (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2020]; IOM 2001).</p><p>In general, treatment of iron deficiency or IDA in pregnancy is the same as in nonpregnant females (USPSTF [Siu 2015]). The majority of studies note iron therapy improves maternal hematologic parameters; however, information related to clinical outcomes in the mother and neonate is limited (Auerbach 2017a; FIGO 2019; Reveiz 2011; USPSTF [Siu 2015]; Wong 2016). Oral preparations are generally sufficient; however, parenteral iron therapy may be used in pregnant patients who cannot tolerate or will not take oral iron, in cases of severe iron deficiency, or when malabsorption is present (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2020]). Due to limited safety data in early pregnancy, use of IV iron is generally not started until the second or third trimester (BSH [Pavord 2020]; FIGO 2019). Iron dextran has been evaluated for the treatment of IDA in pregnancy (Auerbach 2017a; Darwish 2017; Reveiz 2011; Wong 2016).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent low iron in the body.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
