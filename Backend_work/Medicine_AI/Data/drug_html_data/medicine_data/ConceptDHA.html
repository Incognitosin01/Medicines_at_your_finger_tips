Polysaccharide Iron Complex is clinically non-toxic. Prior studies in rats demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron Complex (PIC), administered as a single oral dose to Sprague Dawley rats did not produce evidence of toxicity at a dosage level of 5000 mg Iron/kg: (An Acute Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with Polysaccharide-Iron Complex. T.N.Merriman, M. Aikman and R.E. Rush, Springborn Laboratories, Inc. Spencerville, Ohio Study No. 3340.1 March - April 1994). Other clinical studies had demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron gives a good hematopoietic response with an almost complete absence of the side effects usually associated with oral iron therapy. Picinni and Ricciotti suggested in 1982, that "the therapeutic effectiveness of Polysaccharide Iron Complex when compared with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, appears to be as active as the iron fumarate and as well tolerated, however, it exerted a greater influence on the level of hemoglobin and on the number of red cells..." and that, "it has been exceptionally well tolerated by all patients" (Picinni, L.-Ricciotti, M. 1982. Therapeutic effectiveness of an iron-polysaccharide complex in comparison with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemias):    PANMINERVA MEDICA-EUROPA MEDICA, Vol. 24, No. 3, pp. 213-220 (July - September 1982). As mentioned above, the patented source of iron used in Concept DHATM (Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex) provides a high level of elemental iron with a low incidence of gastric distress.<br/>
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, the oral combination of Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex was better tolerated and safer than the oral administration of Ferrous Fumarate alone. The conclusion of this research stated, that the addition of PIC to Ferrous Fumarate surprisingly allows the same concentration of Ferrous Fumarate to be better tolerated than the Ferrous Fumarate alone.</p><p class="First">INDICATIONS: Concept DHATM is a prescription prenatal vitamin-mineral preparation containing omega-3 fatty acid supplements designed to supply nutritional supplementation for women throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period to lactating and non-lactating mothers. Concept DHATM may also be used to improve the nutritional status of women before conception.</p><p class="First">WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. WARNING: Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils per day may have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and INR (international normalized ratio). DHA should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diatheses, including those taking anticoagulants.<br/>
WARNING: Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient.<br/>
PRECAUTIONS: General: Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg - 0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p class="First">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Adults (persons over 12 years of age), one (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician.
