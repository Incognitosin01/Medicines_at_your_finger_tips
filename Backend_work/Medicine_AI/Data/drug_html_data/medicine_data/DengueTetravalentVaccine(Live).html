Those not previously infected are at increased risk for severe dengue disease when vaccinated and subsequently infected with dengue virus. Previous dengue infection can be assessed through a medical record of a previous laboratory-confirmed dengue infection or through serological testing prior to vaccination. The safety and effectiveness of dengue tetravalent vaccine (live) have not been established in individuals living in dengue nonendemic areas who travel to dengue endemic areas.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Severe hypersensitivity to dengue tetravalent vaccine (live) or any component of the formulation; severe immunodeficiency or immunosuppression due to disease or therapy</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Dengue disease (fever) prevention (immunization): Note:</b> Should only be used in individuals with previous dengue disease (laboratory-confirmed) and living in endemic areas. Administration to individuals without previous infection increases the risk of severe dengue disease.</p><p>Children ≥9 years and Adolescents ≤16 years: SubQ: 0.5 mL/dose for 3 doses administered at 0, 6, and 12 months.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store lyophilized vaccine antigen and diluent refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze. Protect from light. After reconstitution, use immediately or store refrigerated for up to 30 minutes; discard if not used within 30 minutes of reconstitution.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Atoltivimab, Maftivimab, and Odesivimab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Live).

Management: Two or more injectable or nasally administered live vaccines not administered on the same day should be separated by at least 28 days (ie, 4 weeks). If not, the vaccine administered second should be repeated at least 4 week later.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Venetoclax: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vaccines (Live). Venetoclax may diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Live). Management: Avoid use of live, attenuated vaccines before, during, or after (prior to B-cell recovery) venetoclax treatment.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Headache (30%), malaise (19% to 21%)</p><p>Local: Pain at injection site (23% to 32%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Myalgia (20% to 29%), asthenia (18% to 25%)</p><p>1% to 10%: Local: Swelling at injection site (2% to 4%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Abdominal pain, anaphylaxis, dyspnea, erythema of skin, hematoma at injection site, hypersensitivity reaction, injection site pruritus, local anesthesia (injection site), status asthmaticus, urticaria, vertigo, vomiting</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available during vaccine use (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Adults: Not intended for use in patients &gt;16 years of age.</p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Use is contraindicated in severely immunocompromised patients (eg, patients receiving chemo-/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination or may have an adverse event secondary to replication.</p><p>• Persons not previously infected with dengue virus: Do not administer to persons not previously infected with dengue virus; administration to these persons is associated with an increased risk of severe dengue disease when the vaccinated individual is subsequently infected with any dengue virus serotype. Prior to vaccination, evaluate individuals for prior dengue infection (ie, documentation of previous laboratory-confirmed infection or perform serotesting).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Only for use in patients with laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and living in endemic areas.</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Observe for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Information related to the use of dengue tetravalent vaccine (live) in pregnancy is limited (Skipetrova 2018). It is not known if the live virus from this vaccine can be transmitted from mother to fetus; however, vertical transmission of dengue virus has been reported in infected females with viremia at delivery</p><p>Maternal infection with dengue virus may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following maternal immunization with dengue tetravalent vaccine (live) is ongoing. Healthcare providers are encouraged to enroll females vaccinated during pregnancy in the Pregnancy Registry (800-822-2463); females may also enroll themselves.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent dengue.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
