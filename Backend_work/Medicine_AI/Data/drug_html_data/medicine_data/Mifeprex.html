Then, you must sign a Patient Agreement form stating that you understand the risks and benefits of using this medicine.</p><p>Complete treatment to end the pregnancy will require at least 2 visits to your doctor.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>At the first visit (Day 1) you will be given a Mifeprex tablet. You will also be given or prescribed 4 misoprostol tablets. If you receive only a prescription for misoprostol, be sure to get the prescription filled right away so you will be ready to take the medicine on schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 24 to 48 hours, you will take 4 misoprostol tablets at one time. For treatment to be effective, you must take misoprostol 24 to 48 hours after you took Mifeprex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Misoprostol can cause cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and other side effects. Your doctor may give you medicine to treat or prevent these side effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your uterus should begin to pass the pregnancy within 2 to 24 hours after taking misoprostol. Be sure you are in a place where you will be ready for this to happen. You will likely have fairly heavy vaginal bleeding while your uterus is passing the pregnancy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the second visit (Day 7 to 14 after you took Mifeprex), your doctor will check your uterus to make sure the pregnancy has completely ended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your body has not completely passed the pregnancy, you may be given another dose of misoprostol. If you take a second dose of misoprostol, you should have a follow-up visit 7 days later.</p>

But sometimes you can have cramping and bleeding and still be pregnant. <b>Only your doctor can confirm whether your pregnancy has completely ended.</b> Using a home pregnancy test kit is not effective in confirming that your uterus has been completely cleared of the pregnancy. Do not miss any of your follow-up visits.</p><p>You may need surgery to end the pregnancy completely. Carrying a pregnancy to term after taking Mifeprex or misoprostol may cause birth defects or death of the baby. Talk with your doctor about your treatment options.</p><p>Bleeding and spotting are normal side effects of Mifeprex and misoprostol. It is possible to continue bleeding for up to 30 days. Bleeding may be heavier than a normal heavy period, and you may also pass blood clots and tissue.</p><p><b>Call your doctor if you bleed enough to soak through 2 full-size sanitary pads per hour for 2 hours in a row.</b> In rare cases, serious and sometimes fatal bleeding or infection may occur after termination of a pregnancy. <b>Call your doctor if you have heavy vaginal bleeding or a general ill feeling.</b> You may also have a fever, stomach pain, or fast heartbeats.</p><p><b>Go to an emergency room if you still have any of the following symptoms more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol:</b> fever, severe stomach pain, heavy or prolonged vaginal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or feeling like you might pass out. <b>Be sure to tell your caregivers when you last took misoprostol.</b></p><p>It is possible to get pregnant again right after terminating a pregnancy. You may begin using birth control after your doctor has confirmed that treatment with Mifeprex has effectively ended your pregnancy.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Mifeprex is used as a single dose, it does not have a daily dosing schedule.</p><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss any follow-up appointment.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since Mifeprex is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after taking Mifeprex?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><p>Grapefruit and grapefruit juice can make it harder for your body to metabolize Mifeprex. Avoid the use of grapefruit products shortly before or after taking Mifeprex.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Mifeprex side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
