Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>SubQ: For SubQ administration in the arms, abdomen, hips, or thighs; rotate injection sites to possibly minimize the occurrence of lipoatrophy. Do not administer IV. Administer the 40 mg dose on the same 3 days each week (eg, Monday, Wednesday, Friday) at least 48 hours apart. Allow syringe to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes prior to injection. Discard unused portions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). If needed, may store at 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) for up to 1 month (refrigeration is preferred). Avoid exposure to high temperatures; protect from intense light. Do not freeze.

Episodes usually begin ≥1 month after initiation of treatment.</p><p>• Hepatic toxicity: Liver failure and hepatitis with jaundice (sometimes severe) have occurred from days to years after initiation of therapy; consider discontinuation of therapy if signs and symptoms occur.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactoid reactions (rare) have been reported.</p><p>• Immune response: Although there has not been a systematic evaluation of glatiramer’s potential to affect other immune functions, it may interfere with recognition of foreign antigens undermining the body's tumor surveillance and defense system against infection.</p><p>• Lipoatrophy: May occur locally at injection site at various times after treatment (sometimes after several months) and may not resolve; to possibly minimize occurrence, advise patients to follow proper injection technique and rotate site with each injection. Skin necrosis has also been observed.</p><p>• Systemic reactions: Postinjection systemic reactions may occur immediately (within seconds to minutes of injection; majority of reactions observed within 1 hour) and in a substantial percentage of patients (~16% [20 mg/mL] and ~2% [40 mg/mL] in studies); symptoms (anxiety, chest pain, constriction of the throat, dyspnea, flushing, palpitations, tachycardia, urticaria) are usually self-limited and transient. These symptoms generally occur several months after initiation of treatment.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Antigenic: Glatiramer acetate is antigenic and may possibly lead to the induction of untoward host responses. Glatiramer acetate-reactive antibodies (IgG subtype) form in most patients.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>In general, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) are stopped prior to a planned pregnancy, except in females at high risk of MS activity (AAN [Rae-Grant 2018]). When disease-modifying therapy is needed in females planning a pregnancy (eg, high risk of disease reactivation), glatiramer acetate may be considered until pregnancy is confirmed. Delaying pregnancy is recommended for females with persistent high disease activity (ECTRIMS/EAN [Montalban 2018]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Information related to the use of glatiramer acetate in pregnancy is available (Fragoso 2014; Herbstritt 2016; MacDonald 2019; Nguyen 2019; Sandberg-Wollheim 2018).</p><p>In general, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) are not initiated during pregnancy, except in females at high risk of MS activity (AAN [Rae-Grant 2018]). When disease-modifying therapy is needed in females planning a pregnancy (eg, high risk of disease reactivation), glatiramer acetate may be considered until pregnancy is confirmed, and in select cases (eg, women with active disease), use may be continued during pregnancy (ECTRIMS/EAN [Montalban 2018]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to lower the number of setbacks with MS (multiple sclerosis).</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
