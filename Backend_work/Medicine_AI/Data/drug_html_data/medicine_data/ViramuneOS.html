Women, including pregnant women, or patients with higher CD4+ cell counts are at higher risk of hepatotoxicity. Permanently discontinue nevirapine following severe hepatic, skin, or hypersensitivity reactions. Check transaminase levels immediately for all patients who develop a rash during the first 18 weeks of treatment. Monitor patients intensively during the first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine to detect potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity or skin reactions. Extra vigilance is warranted during the first 6 weeks of therapy, which is the period of greatest risk for adverse events.

HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). It works by lowering the amount of HIV in the blood.</p><p>Nevirapine will not cure HIV infection or AIDS, however, it helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. Nevirapine will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive this medicine may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Viramune O/S</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

However, safety and efficacy have not been established in infants younger than 15 days of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nevirapine <i>extended-release tablets</i> in children 6 years of age and older with a body surface area of 1.17 square meter (m) or greater. However, use is not recommended in children younger than 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 6 years of age with a body surface area of less than 1.17 m.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nevirapine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving nevirapine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
