Monitor closely for signs and symptoms of adrenocorticoid insufficiency, which could be masked by adverse events associated with mineralocorticoid excess. Diagnostic testing for adrenal insufficiency may be clinically indicated. Increased corticosteroid doses may be required before, during, and after stress.</p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: Severe hepatotoxicity (eg, fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure, and death) has been reported. Significant increases in liver enzymes (including grade 3 and 4 events) have also been observed (higher likelihood in patients with baseline elevations), generally occurring in the first 3 months of treatment. May require dosage reduction, treatment interruption, and/or discontinuation. ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be monitored prior to treatment, every 2 weeks for 3 months and monthly thereafter; patients with hepatic impairment, elevations in liver function tests, or experiencing hepatotoxicity require more frequent monitoring (see dosage adjustment for hepatic impairment and monitoring parameters). Evaluate liver function promptly with signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity. The safety of retreatment after significant elevations (ALT or AST ≥20 times the ULN and/or total bilirubin ≥10 times ULN) has not been evaluated.</p><p>• Mineralocorticoid excess: Increased mineralocorticoids due to CYP17 inhibition may result in hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention (including grade 3 and 4 events). Monitor at least monthly for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention (if necessary, control blood pressure and correct hypokalemia prior to and during treatment). Concomitant administration with corticosteroids reduces the incidence and severity of these adverse events.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: May cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention. Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia prior to and during treatment. QT prolongation and torsades de pointes have been observed rarely (postmarketing reports) in patients who developed hypokalemia during abiraterone administration. Monitor patients with cardiovascular disease closely, particularly those with heart failure, recent MI, or ventricular arrhythmia. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% or NYHA class II, III, or IV heart failure were excluded from clinical trials. Monitor at least monthly for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes; severe hypoglycemia has been reported, particularly in patients receiving concomitant therapy with thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) or repaglinide. Monitor blood glucose during and after discontinuation of abiraterone therapy; antidiabetic medication dosage adjustments may be needed.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Do not use in patients with preexisting severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C); dosage reduction is recommended in patients with baseline moderate impairment.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues: </i></b></p><p>• Radium Ra 223 dichloride: Due to an increased risk of fractures and mortality, the use of abiraterone plus a corticosteroid in combination with radium Ra 223 dichloride is not recommended.</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Tablet formulations: Abiraterone acetate is available in different tablet formulations (the conventional formulation [Zytiga] and a micronized [fine particle] formulation [Yonsa]); use caution when selecting dosage form as dosing and food effects vary between products. The formulations are NOT interchangeable; do not substitute between formulations.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Food: Abiraterone (Zytiga) must be administered on an empty stomach (administer at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after any food); abiraterone AUC (exposure) may be increased up to 10-fold if administered with a meal. Abiraterone micronized (Yonsa) may be administered without regard to food.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to treatment, every 2 weeks for 3 months and monthly thereafter; if baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to treatment, weekly for the first month, every 2 weeks for 2 months then monthly thereafter. If hepatotoxicity develops during treatment (and only after therapy is interrupted and liver function tests have returned to safe levels), monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin every 2 weeks for 3 months and monthly thereafter. Monitoring of testosterone levels is not necessary. Serum potassium (prior to treatment and at least monthly).</p><p>Monitor for signs and symptoms of adrenocorticoid insufficiency; if clinically indicated, consider appropriate diagnostics to confirm adrenal insufficiency. Monitor blood pressure and for fluid retention (prior to treatment and at least monthly). Monitor adherence.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 weeks after the last abiraterone dose.</p><p>Abiraterone is available in uncoated and film-coated tablets and in micronized tablets; the manufacturer recommends females who may become pregnant wear gloves if handling uncoated tablets, micronized tablets, or tablets that are broken, crushed, or damaged. NIOSH recommends single gloving for administration of hazardous intact oral tablets (NIOSH 2016).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on the mechanism of action and adverse effects observed in animal reproduction studies, abiraterone may cause fetal harm or fetal loss if administered during pregnancy.
