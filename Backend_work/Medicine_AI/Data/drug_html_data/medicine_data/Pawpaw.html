It is common in the temperate woodlands of the eastern United States and is an orchard crop in several states.3 Its large, drooping leaves give the plant a tropical appearance. The dark brown, velvety flowers, which can bloom for up to 6 weeks, are approximately 5 cm across and grow in umbrella-like whorls similar to those of some magnolia species. The fruit is smooth-skinned and yellow to greenish-brown in color, measures from approximately 8 to 15 cm long, and can reach up to 0.45 kg in weight. It resembles a short, thick banana and is similar in nutrient value but has a very short shelf life, which currently limits culinary and commercial uses.3 The yellow, soft, custard-like pulp is edible but sickly sweet in flavor and contains dark seeds.4, 5, 6</p><h2>History</h2><p>Pawpaw bark has been used medicinally due its useful alkaloid content. It has also been used as food by American Indians and the thin, fibrous, inner bark has been used to make fishing nets.4</p><p>The seeds of several Annonaceous species have an emetic properties, and in 1898 Eli Lilly Inc. sold an A. triloba extract for inducing emesis.6 Topical preparations exploit the pesticidal properties of the plant. An ointment for use in oral herpes is commercially available.7, 8</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>The bark, roots, twigs, and seeds of A. triloba contain acetogenins, long-chain, aliphatic compounds with 35 to 39 carbon atoms ending with a gamma-lactone, cyclized in tetrahydrofuran rings. Acetogenins are polyketide-derived molecules and are unique to the Annonaceae family. About 400 acetogenins from Asimina and other genera have been identified.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14</p><p>A variety of essential oils and other extracts from the leaf of the pawpaw plant have been described, with sesquiterpenes dominating the oil composition (83%).15, 16 The fruit, which contains phenolic acids and flavonoids, is a dietary source of antioxidants, although flavonoid content decreases greatly with ripening.3, 17, 18, 19 The fruit contains fatty acids ranging from C6 to C20.20</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Antimicrobial</h3><p>The pawpaw tree is usually insect- or disease-resistant because of its acetogenin content, which deters the feeding of many organisms.21 Antifungal and pesticidal properties have been demonstrated, with different plant parts having differing potencies. Small twigs yielded the most potent extract, while the leaves were the least potent. Unripe fruits, seeds, root wood and bark, and stem bark were also potent.22 Extracts of the plant were anthelminthic in vitro.23</p><p>Despite the availability of topical preparations, no clinical data exist regarding the use of A. triloba for antimicrobial effects.8</p><h3>Cancer</h3><p>Certain acetogenins have exhibited cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines.9, 24, 25, 26 A mechanism of action may be inhibition of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: ubiquinone oxidoreductase,  causing a decrease in cellular adenosine triphosphate levels.21, 27 Acetogenins may also inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor-1, resulting in the suppression of angiogenesis in tumors.28  Despite concerns regarding the toxicity of A. triloba extracts, limited studies have been conducted in rodents. Acetogenins may be less toxic than standard chemotherapy.7</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of A. triloba in cancer; however, a trial has been conducted using acetogenins from an unrelated plant.29</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Clinical trials are lacking to provide guidance on dosing, and concerns of toxicity persist.30</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Handling of the fruit may produce a skin rash in sensitive individuals.1 The sensitizing potential of the pawpaw was examined in guinea pigs; the crude extract of the stem bark was found to be a weak sensitizer and to elicit allergic contact dermatitis. This report also determined the active compound asimicin to be a weak irritant.31 Acetogenins may also be irritating to the eyes.1</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Pawpaw fruit contains the neurotoxins annonacin and squamocin,32 and has been linked to Parkinsonism in some reports;30 however, case studies are lacking.10 Neurotoxicity has been reported in rodents.8, 33 Ames tests for mutagenicity have largely been negative.8</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
