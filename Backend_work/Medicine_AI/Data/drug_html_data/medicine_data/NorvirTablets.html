</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Co-administration of NORVIR with several classes of drugs including sedative hypnotics, antiarrhythmics, or ergot alkaloid preparations may result in potentially serious and/or life-threatening adverse events due to possible effects of NORVIR on the hepatic metabolism of certain drugs. Review medications taken by patients prior to prescribing NORVIR or when prescribing other medications to patients already taking NORVIR <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Norvir Tablets</h2><p class="First">Norvir Tablets and oral solution are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.</p><p>NORVIR oral powder is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection.</p><h2>Norvir Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Administration Recommendations</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>NORVIR must be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents.</li>
<li>NORVIR is administered orally. Norvir Tablets should be swallowed whole, and not chewed, broken or crushed. Take NORVIR with meals.</li>
<li>Patients may improve the taste of NORVIR oral solution by mixing with chocolate milk, Ensure<span class="Sup">®</span>, or Advera<span class="Sup">®</span> within one hour of dosing.</li>
<li>NORVIR oral powder should be mixed with soft food such as apple sauce or vanilla pudding, or mixed with liquid such as water, chocolate milk, or infant formula <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Instructions for Use]</span>. The bitter aftertaste of NORVIR oral powder may be lessened if administered with food.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Dosing Guidelines</span></p><p>Patients who take the 600 mg twice daily soft gel capsule NORVIR dose may experience more gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea when switching from the soft gel capsule to the tablet formulation because of greater maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) achieved with the tablet formulation relative to the soft gel capsule <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Patients should also be aware that these adverse events (gastrointestinal or paresthesias) may diminish as therapy is continued.</p><h3>Administering Oral Solution by Feeding Tube</h3><p class="First">Because NORVIR oral solution contains ethanol and propylene glycol, it is not recommended for use with polyurethane feeding tubes due to potential incompatibility. Feeding tubes that are compatible with ethanol and propylene glycol, such as silicone and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) feeding tubes, can be used for administration of NORVIR oral solution. Follow instructions for use of the feeding tube to administer the medicine.</p><h3>Dosage Recommendations in Adults</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Recommended Dosage for Treatment of HIV-1:</span></p><p>The recommended dosage of NORVIR is 600 mg twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals. Use of a dose titration schedule may help to reduce treatment-emergent adverse events while maintaining appropriate ritonavir plasma levels. NORVIR should be started at no less than 300 mg twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 100 mg twice daily. The maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily should not be exceeded upon completion of the titration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnant Women</span></p><p>NORVIR oral solution is not recommended during pregnancy due to its ethanol content. NORVIR oral solution contains the excipients ethanol (approx. 43% v/v) and propylene glycol (approx. 27% w/v) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Recommendations in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">NORVIR must be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. The recommended dosage of NORVIR in pediatric patients older than 1 month is 350 to 400 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily. NORVIR should be started at 250 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily. If patients do not tolerate 400 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily due to adverse events, the highest tolerated dose may be used for maintenance therapy in combination with other antiretroviral agents, however, alternative therapy should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Dosage Guidelines for Oral Solution</span></p><p>NORVIR oral solution should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age (first day of the mother’s last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth) of 44 weeks has been attained <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>NORVIR oral solution contains the excipients ethanol (approx. 43% v/v) and propylene glycol (approx. 27% w/v). Special attention should be given to accurate calculation of the dose of NORVIR, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors, and overdose. This is especially important for young children. Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to pediatric patients 1 to 6 months of age should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)]</span>. When possible, dose should be administered using a calibrated dosing syringe.</p><p>Body surface area (BSA) can be calculated as follows<span class="Sup">1</span>:</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Dosage Guidelines for Oral Powder</span></p><p>NORVIR oral powder should be used only for dosing increments of 100 mg. NORVIR powder should not be used for doses less than 100 mg or for incremental doses between 100 mg intervals. NORVIR oral solution is the preferred formulation for patients requiring doses less than 100 mg or incremental doses between 100 mg intervals.</p><h3>Preparation of Norvir Oral Powder</h3><p class="First">For details on the preparation and administration of NORVIR oral powder (see <span class="Italics">Instructions for Use</span>). NORVIR oral powder should only be used for dosing increments of 100 mg.</p><p>Prepare the dose using the required number of packets. For example, use one packet for doses of 100 mg and two packets for doses of 200 mg. Pour and mix the entire contents of each packet over soft food or liquid. All of the powder mixed with soft food or liquid should be administered within 2 hours of preparation. If not administered within 2 hours of preparation, the mixture should be discarded and a new dose prepared.</p><p>The prescribed dose of NORVIR oral powder can be administered via a feeding tube after being mixed with water (see <span class="Italics">Instructions for Use</span>). Follow the instructions for the feeding tube to administer the medicine.</p><h3>Dose Modification due to Drug Interaction</h3><p class="First">Dose reduction of NORVIR is necessary when used with other protease inhibitors: atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir.</p><p>Prescribers should consult the full prescribing information and clinical study information of these protease inhibitors if they are co-administered with a reduced dose of ritonavir <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>, and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Initiation of NORVIR, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving NORVIR, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of NORVIR, respectively. These interactions may lead to:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.</li>
<li>Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of NORVIR.</li>
<li>Loss of therapeutic effect of NORVIR and possible development of resistance.</li>
</ul><p>When co-administering NORVIR with other protease inhibitors, see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important Warnings and Precautions.</p><p>See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during NORVIR therapy; review concomitant medications during NORVIR therapy, and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Toxicity in Preterm Neonates</h3><p class="First">NORVIR oral solution contains the excipients ethanol (approx. 43% v/v) and propylene glycol (approx. 27% w/v). When administered concomitantly with propylene glycol, ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations. Preterm neonates may be at an increased risk of propylene glycol-associated adverse events due to diminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol, thereby leading to accumulation and potential adverse events. Postmarketing life-threatening cases of cardiac toxicity (including complete AV block, bradycardia, and cardiomyopathy), lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, CNS depression and respiratory complications leading to death have been reported, predominantly in preterm neonates receiving lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution which also contains the excipients ethanol and propylene glycol.</p><p>NORVIR oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities. However, if the benefit of using NORVIR oral solution to treat HIV infection in infants immediately after birth outweighs the potential risks, infants should be monitored closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine, and for toxicity related to NORVIR oral solution including: hyperosmolality, with or without lactic acidosis, renal toxicity, CNS depression (including stupor, coma, and apnea), seizures, hypotonia, cardiac arrhythmias and ECG changes, and hemolysis. Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to infants should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Hepatic transaminase elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving NORVIR alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Table 3). There may be an increased risk for transaminase elevations in patients with underlying hepatitis B or C. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering NORVIR to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in these patients, especially during the first three months of NORVIR treatment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction, including some fatalities. These have generally occurred in patients taking multiple concomitant medications and/or with advanced AIDS.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving NORVIR therapy, including those who developed hypertriglyceridemia. In some cases fatalities have been observed. Patients with advanced HIV disease may be at increased risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>. Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or abnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of pancreatitis should occur. Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and NORVIR therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made.</p><h3>Allergic Reactions/Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Allergic reactions including urticaria, mild skin eruptions, bronchospasm, and angioedema have been reported. Cases of anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reactions develop.</p><h3>PR Interval Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in some patients. Post marketing cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported in patients.</p><p>NORVIR should be used with caution in patients with underlying structural heart disease, preexisting conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, as these patients may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities.</p><p>The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, digoxin and atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Lipid Disorders</h3><p class="First">Treatment with NORVIR therapy alone or in combination with saquinavir has resulted in substantial increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating NORVIR therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate, taking into account any potential drug-drug interactions with NORVIR and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)</span>and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established. Consider monitoring for hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes mellitus, or an exacerbation of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with NORVIR.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including NORVIR. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci</span> pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Fat Redistribution</h3><p class="First">Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.</p><h3>Patients with Hemophilia</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis, in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.</p><h3>Resistance/Cross-resistance</h3><p class="First">Varying degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed. Continued administration of ritonavir 600 mg twice daily following loss of viral suppression may increase the likelihood of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Ritonavir has been shown to increase triglycerides, cholesterol, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), GGT, CPK, and uric acid. Appropriate laboratory testing should be performed prior to initiating NORVIR therapy and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms occur during therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><p>When co-administering NORVIR with other protease inhibitors, see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including adverse reactions.</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Adults</span></p><p>The safety of NORVIR alone and in combination with other antiretroviral agents was studied in 1,755 adult patients. Table 2 lists treatment-emergent Adverse Reactions (with possible or probable relationship to study drug) occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of adult patients receiving NORVIR in combined Phase II/IV studies.</p><p>The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions among patients receiving NORVIR alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs were gastrointestinal (including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (upper and lower)), neurological disturbances (including paresthesia and oral paresthesia), rash, and fatigue/asthenia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Laboratory Abnormalities in Adults</span></p><p>Table 3 shows the percentage of adult patients who developed marked laboratory abnormalities.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>NORVIR has been studied in 265 pediatric patients greater than 1 month to 21 years of age. The adverse event profile observed during pediatric clinical trials was similar to that for adult patients.</p><p>Vomiting, diarrhea, and skin rash/allergy were the only drug-related clinical adverse events of moderate to severe intensity observed in greater than or equal to 2% of pediatric patients enrolled in NORVIR clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Italics">Laboratory Abnormalities in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>The following Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities occurred in greater than 3% of pediatric patients who received treatment with NORVIR either alone or in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors: neutropenia (9%), hyperamylasemia (7%), thrombocytopenia (5%), anemia (4%), and elevated AST (3%).</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse events (not previously mentioned in the labeling) have been reported during post-marketing use of NORVIR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to NORVIR exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Body as a Whole</span></p><p>Dehydration, usually associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, and sometimes resulting in hypotension, syncope, or renal insufficiency has been reported. Syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and renal insufficiency have also been reported without known dehydration.</p><p>Co-administration of ritonavir with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>First-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, third-degree AV block, right bundle branch block have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Cardiac and neurologic events have been reported when ritonavir has been co-administered with disopyramide, mexiletine, nefazodone, fluoxetine, and beta blockers.

Also, see Cardiovascular System.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal and Urinary Disorders</span></p><p>Nephrolithiasis</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span></p><p>Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has been reported.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">When co-administering NORVIR with other protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir), see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important information for drug interactions.</p><h3>Potential for NORVIR to Affect Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">Ritonavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC (greater than 3-fold) when co-administered with ritonavir. Thus, co-administration of NORVIR with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 4.</p><p>Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 to a lesser extent. Co-administration of substrates of CYP2D6 with ritonavir could result in increases (up to 2-fold) in the AUC of the other agent, possibly requiring a proportional dosage reduction. Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 as well as other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase.</p><p>These examples are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with ritonavir. The healthcare provider should consult appropriate references for comprehensive information.</p><h3>Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Table 4 provides a list of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. Alteration in dose or regimen may be recommended based on drug interaction studies or predicted interaction <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> for magnitude of interaction.</p><ul class="Disc">

The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7%-2.9%) following first-trimester exposure to ritonavir-containing regimens and 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3%-3.5%) following second and third trimester exposure to ritonavir-containing regimens.</p><p>While placental transfer of ritonavir and fetal ritonavir concentrations are generally low, detectable levels have been observed in cord blood samples and neonate hair.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Ritonavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 0, 15, 35, and 75 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (at 0, 25, 50, and 110 mg/kg/day) during organogenesis (on gestation days 6 through 17 and 6 through 19, respectively). No evidence of teratogenicity due to ritonavir was observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing systemic exposures (AUC) equivalent to approximately 1/3 lower than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Developmental toxicity observed in rats (early resorptions, decreased fetal body weight and ossification delays and developmental variations) occurred at a maternally toxic dose, at an exposure equivalent to approximately 1/3 lower than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. A slight increase in the incidence of cryptorchidism was also noted in rats (at a maternally toxic dose) at an exposure approximately 1/5 lower than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Developmental toxicity was observed in rabbits (resorptions, decreased litter size and decreased fetal weights) at maternally toxic doses approximately 1.8 times higher than the recommended daily dose, based on a body surface area conversion factor. In pre-and postnatal development study in rats, ritonavir was administered at doses of 0, 15, 35, and 60 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20. At doses of 60 mg/kg/day, no developmental toxicity was noted with ritonavir dosage equivalent to 1/2 of the recommended daily dose, based on a body surface area conversion factor.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV.</p><p>Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk.</p><p>There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants) and (3) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving NORVIR.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p>Use of NORVIR may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">In HIV-infected patients age greater than 1 month to 21 years, the antiviral activity and adverse event profile seen during clinical trials and through postmarketing experience were similar to that for adult patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of NORVIR did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment of ritonavir is necessary for patients with either mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore, ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acute Overdosage - Human Overdose Experience</span></p><p>Human experience of acute overdose with NORVIR is limited. One patient in clinical trials took NORVIR 1500 mg per day for two days. The patient reported paresthesias which resolved after the dose was decreased. A post-marketing case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported with ritonavir overdose.</p><p>The approximate lethal dose was found to be greater than 20 times the related human dose in rats and 10 times the related human dose in mice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Management of Overdosage</span></p><p>NORVIR oral solution contains approx. 43% ethanol (v/v) and approx. 27% (w/v) propylene glycol. Ingestion of the product over the recommended dose by a young child could result in significant toxicity and could potentially be lethal.</p><p>Treatment of overdose with NORVIR consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose with NORVIR. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed drug. Since ritonavir is extensively metabolized by the liver and is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the drug. However, dialysis can remove both ethanol and propylene glycol in the case of overdose with ritonavir oral solution. A Certified Poison Control Center should be consulted for up-to-date information on the management of overdose with NORVIR.</p><h2>Norvir Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">NORVIR (ritonavir) is an inhibitor of HIV protease with activity against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).</p><p>Ritonavir is chemically designated as 10-Hydroxy-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-1- [2-(1-methylethyl)-4-thiazolyl]-3,6-dioxo-8,11-bis(phenylmethyl)-2,4,7,12- tetraazatridecan-13-oic acid, 5-thiazolylmethyl ester, [5S-(5R*,8R*,10R*,11R*)].

Inhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor which leads to production of non-infectious immature HIV particles.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture</span></p><p>The activity of ritonavir was assessed in acutely infected lymphoblastoid cell lines and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The concentration of drug that inhibits 50% (EC<span class="Sub">50</span>) value of viral replication ranged from 3.8 to 153 nM depending upon the HIV-1 isolate and the cells employed. The average EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value for low passage clinical isolates was 22 nM (n = 13). In MT<span class="Sub">4</span> cells, ritonavir demonstrated additive effects against HIV-1 in combination with either didanosine (ddI) or zidovudine (ZDV). Studies which measured cytotoxicity of ritonavir on several cell lines showed that greater than 20 microM was required to inhibit cellular growth by 50% resulting in a cell culture therapeutic index of at least 1000.</p><p><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to ritonavir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed mutations in the HIV-1 protease gene leading to amino acid substitutions I84V, V82F, A71V, and M46I. Phenotypic (n = 18) and genotypic (n = 48) changes in HIV-1 isolates from selected patients treated with ritonavir were monitored in phase I/II trials over a period of 3 to 32 weeks. Substitutions associated with the HIV–1 viral protease in isolates obtained from 43 patients appeared to occur in a stepwise and ordered fashion at positions V82A/F/T/S, I54V, A71V/T, and I36L, followed by combinations of substitutions at an additional 5 specific amino acid positions (M46I/L, K20R, I84V, L33F and L90M). Of 18 patients for whom both phenotypic and genotypic analysis were performed on free virus isolated from plasma, 12 showed reduced susceptibility to ritonavir in cell culture. All 18 patients possessed one or more substitutions in the viral protease gene. The V82A/F substitution appeared to be necessary but not sufficient to confer phenotypic resistance. Phenotypic resistance was defined as a greater than or equal to 5-fold decrease in viral sensitivity in cell culture from baseline.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cross-Resistance to Other Antiretrovirals</span></p><p>Among protease inhibitors variable cross-resistance has been recognized. Serial HIV-1 isolates obtained from six patients during ritonavir therapy showed a decrease in ritonavir susceptibility in cell culture but did not demonstrate a concordant decrease in susceptibility to saquinavir in cell culture when compared to matched baseline isolates. However, isolates from two of these patients demonstrated decreased susceptibility to indinavir in cell culture (8-fold). Isolates from 5 patients were also tested for cross-resistance to amprenavir and nelfinavir; isolates from 3 patients had a decrease in susceptibility to nelfinavir (6- to 14-fold), and none to amprenavir. Cross-resistance between ritonavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors is unlikely because of the different enzyme targets involved. One ZDV-resistant HIV-1 isolate tested in cell culture retained full susceptibility to ritonavir.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been carried out on ritonavir. In male mice, at levels of 50, 100 or 200 mg per kg per day, there was a dose dependent increase in the incidence of both adenomas and combined adenomas and carcinomas in the liver. Based on AUC measurements, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 0.3-fold for males that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose (600 mg twice-daily). There were no carcinogenic effects seen in females at the dosages tested. The exposure at the high dose was approximately 0.6-fold for the females that of the exposure in humans. In rats dosed at levels of 7, 15 or 30 mg per kg per day there were no carcinogenic effects. In this study, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 6% that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose.

NORVIR 600 mg twice-daily or placebo was added to each patient's baseline antiretroviral therapy regimen, which could have consisted of up to two approved antiretroviral agents. The study accrued 1,090 patients, with mean baseline CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell count at study entry of 32 cells per μL. After the clinical benefit of NORVIR therapy was demonstrated, all patients were eligible to switch to open-label NORVIR for the duration of the follow-up period. Median duration of double-blind therapy with NORVIR and placebo was 6 months. The median duration of follow-up through the end of the open-label phase was 13.5 months for patients randomized to NORVIR and 14 months for patients randomized to placebo.</p><p>The cumulative incidence of clinical disease progression or death during the double-blind phase of Study 247 was 26% for patients initially randomized to NORVIR compared to 42% for patients initially randomized to placebo.

This difference in rates was statistically significant. However, since the analysis at the end of the open-label phase includes patients in the placebo arm who were switched from placebo to NORVIR therapy, the survival benefit of NORVIR cannot be precisely estimated.</p><p>During the double-blind phase of Study 247, CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts increases from baseline for patients randomized to NORVIR at Week 2 and Week 4 were observed.
