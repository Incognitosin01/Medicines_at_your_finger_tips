</ul><p class="First">This product is intended for use only by physicians who are experienced in the use of Allergenic Extracts, or for use under the guidance of an allergist.<br/></p><p>Allergenic Extracts may potentially elicit a severe life-threatening systemic reaction, rarely resulting in death.7 Therefore, emergency measures and personnel trained in their use should be available immediately in the event of such a reaction. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms and cautioned to contact the physician's office if symptoms occur.<br/></p><p>Scratch, prick or puncture test first. Test intradermally only to those antigens giving negative or questionable reactions on scratch, prick or puncture testing.<br/></p><p>This product should never be injected intravenously.<br/></p><p>Patients on non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.6</p><p>Refer also to the WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS Sections below for further discussion.<br/></p><h2>Allergenic Extracts Description</h2><h2>Allergenic Extracts - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Allergenic Extracts for intradermal testing used according to the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Section, produce erythema or erythema and wheal reactions in patients with significant IgE-mediated sensitivity to the relevant allergen. This allergic inflammatory response, although not completely understood, is thought to begin with the reaction of antigen with IgE on the surface of basophils, or mast cells, which initiates a series of biochemical events resulting in the production of histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis and other mediators. These, in turn, produce the immediate-type wheal and flare skin reaction.<br/></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Allergenic Extracts</h2><p class="First">Certain diagnostics carry labeling which states <span class="Bold">Allergenic Extract for Diagnostic Use Only</span>. Data to support the therapeutic use of products labeled with this statement have not been established.15</p><p>In addition to a carefully taken history, the use of intradermal testing extracts is an accepted method in the diagnosis of allergenic conditions.1, 2, 3 When scratch, prick or puncture reactions are small, or if the patient gives a history of allergic symptoms to a substance but scratch, prick or puncture tests are inconclusive, intradermal tests may be indicated. However, ANTIGENS PRODUCING LARGE 3 TO 4+ SCRATCH, PRICK OR PUNCTURE TESTS SHOULD NOT BE TESTED INTRADERMALLY.<br/></p><p>Extracts of all allergens do not produce equivalent results in intradermal testing. The intensity of the skin reaction produced will be determined by two factors: the degree of sensitivity of the patient and the nature of the antigenic extract applied. In general, pollen extracts produce whealing reactions, whereas other inhalants produce erythematous reactions with wheals less often. Skin tests to foods seldom produce whealing reactions except for infrequent instances of severe sensitivity to fish, nuts or spices, and rarely other foods.<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">There are no known absolute contraindications to allergy skin testing. Patients with cardiovascular diseases or pulmonary diseases such as symptomatic asthma, and/or who are receiving cardiovascular drugs such as beta blockers, may be at higher risk for severe adverse reactions. These patients may also be more refractory to the normal anaphylaxis treatment regime.<br/></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Scratch, prick or puncture test first. Test intradermally only to those antigens giving negative or questionable reactions on scratch, prick or puncture testing. Excessively large local reactions or systemic reactions are more likely to occur if the patient is skin tested shortly after exposure to large amounts of antigen to which he or she is sensitive. Therefore, use caution when applying pollen tests to patients during their active pollen season, or after an exposure to inhalant allergens that produce symptoms. Refer to boxed WARNINGS Section.<br/></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>1. General</h3><h3>2. Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be instructed in the recognition of adverse reactions to diagnostic testing. Patients should be made to understand the importance of a 30 to 45 minute observation period and be warned to return to the office promptly if symptoms occur after leaving.<br/>
<br/></p><h3>3. Carcinogenesis, Mutagensis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted with Allergenic Extracts to determine their potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or impairment of fertility.</p><h3>4. Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">4,5 Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Allergenic Extracts. It is also not known whether Allergenic Extracts can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Allergenic Extracts should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>5. Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">There are no current studies on secretion of the allergenic extract components in human milk or effect on the nursing infant. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Allergenic Extracts are administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>6. Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Patients on non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.6<br/>
Certain medications may lessen the skin test wheal and erythema responses elicited by allergens and histamine for varying time periods. Conventional antihistamines should be discontinued at least 5 days before skin testing. Long acting antihistamines should be discontinued for at least 3 weeks prior to skin testing.10Topical steroids should be discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3 weeks before skin testing. 10, 11 Tricyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin should be withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing.12Topical local anesthetics may suppress the flare responses and should be avoided in skin test sites. 13</p><h3>7. Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Skin test wheal size decreases with age. The decrease in allergeninduced skin test reaction parallels that to histamine; therefore, appropriate positive skin test controls should always be performed.1</p><h3>8. Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Wheal sizes in response to allergen skin testing can be smaller in infants than in adults. The skin response to histamine parallels that for allergens; therefore, appropriate postitive control skin tests should always be performed.1</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">1. Local Reactions</span><br/>
Large, persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient's allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and/or the use of oral antihistamines, but they should be considered a warning of possible severe systemic reactions.</p><p><span class="Bold">2. Systemic Reactions</span><br/>
With careful attention to dosage and administration, such reactions occur infrequently, but it must be remembered that Allergenic Extracts are highly potent in sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians administering Allergenic Extracts understand and be prepared for the treatment of severe reactions. Adverse reaction frequency data for allergenic extract administration for testing and treatment show that risk is low.7, 8 It cannot be overemphasized that, under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances, anaphylactic shock is a possibility. Other possible systemic reaction symptoms, in varying degrees of severity, are fainting, pallor, bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, cough, wheezing, conjunctivitis, rhinitis and urticaria. <span class="Bold">If a systemic or anaphylactic reaction does occur, apply a tourniquet above the site of injection, if tests are performed on the arms, and inject the 1:1000 epinephrine-hydrochloride intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the opposite arm. Loosen the tourniquet at least every 10 minutes. Do not obstruct arterial blood flow with the tourniquet.</span></p><h2>OVERDOSE SECTION</h2><h2>Allergenic Extracts Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>5. Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The dose is the same in patients of all age groups. Because the wheal size in response to allergen skin testing decreases with age, appropriate histamine positive control skin tests must be performed.1</p><h3>6. Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The dose is the same in patients of all age groups. Wheal size in response to allergen skin testing can be smaller in infants than in adults. Appropriate histamine positive control skin tests must be performed.1<br/></p><p>Refer to the following table to determine the skin test sensitivity grade. The corresponding ∑E (sum of the longest diameter and the mid-point orthogonal diameters of erythema) is also presented.</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> or with pseudopods</p><p><span class="Sup">b</span> or with many pseudopods<br/></p><p>A positive skin reaction to any allergen must be interpreted in light of the patient’s history of symptoms, time of year, known exposures, and eating habits.<br/>
