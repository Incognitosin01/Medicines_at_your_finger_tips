Increase by 15 mg per day every 2 to 3 weeks to achieve normal serum T3 and T4 levels.<br/>
<br/>
Maintenance: 60 to 120 mg per day.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Thyroid Cancer:</b></p><p>In follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid:<br/>
Doses larger than the ones suggested for replacement therapy (30 mg to 120 mg per day) are required . TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for TSH Suppression:</b></p><p>Doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone.<br/>
<br/>
Iodine (131) uptake is determined before and after the administration of exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.</p><p><b>Usual Pediatric Dose for Hypothyroidism:</b></p><p>Administered orally on an empty stomach:<br/>
0 to 6 months: 4.8 to 6 mg/kg/day<br/>
<br/>
6 to 12 months: 3.6 to 4.8 mg/kg/day<br/>
