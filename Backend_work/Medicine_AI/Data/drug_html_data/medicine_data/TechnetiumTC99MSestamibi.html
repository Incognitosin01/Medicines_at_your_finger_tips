</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi</h2><p class="First">Myocardial Imaging: Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi Injection is a myocardial perfusion agent that is indicated for detecting coronary artery disease by localizing myocardial ischemia (reversible defects) and infarction (non-reversible defects), in evaluating myocardial function and developing information for use in patient management decisions. Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi evaluation of myocardial ischemia can be accomplished with rest and cardiovascular stress techniques (e.g., exercise or pharmacologic stress in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agent’s labeling).</p><p>It is usually not possible to determine the age of a myocardial infarction or to differentiate a recent myocardial infarction from ischemia.</p><p>Breast Imaging: Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi is indicated for planar imaging as a second line diagnostic drug after mammography to assist in the evaluation of breast lesions in patients with an abnormal mammogram or a palpable breast mass.</p><p>Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi is not indicated for breast cancer screening, to confirm the presence or absence of malignancy, and it is not an alternative to biopsy.</p><h2>Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">For Myocardial Imaging: The suggested dose range for I.V. administration of Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi in a single dose to be employed in the average patient (70 Kg) is 370–1110 MBq (10–30 mCi).</p><p>For Breast Imaging: The recommended dose range for I.V. administration of Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi is a single dose of 740–1110 MBq (20–30 mCi).</p><h3>Image Acquisition</h3><p class="First">Breast Imaging: <span class="Bold"> </span>It is recommended that images are obtained with a table overlay to separate breast tissue from the myocardium and liver, and to exclude potential activity that may be present in the opposite breast. For lateral images, position the patient prone with the isolateral arm comfortably above the head, shoulders flat against the table, head turned to the side and relaxed, with the breast imaged pendent through an overlay cutout. The breast should not be compressed on the overlay. For anterior images, position the patient supine with both arms behind the head. For either lateral or anterior images, shield the chest and abdominal organs, or remove them from the field of view.</p><p>For complete study, sets of images should be obtained five minutes after the injection, and in the following sequence:</p><p>Beginning five minutes after the injection of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi:</p><h3>Radiation Dosimetry</h3><p class="First">The radiation doses to organs

product with radiochemical purity of at least 90% was used in the clinical trials that established safety and effectiveness. The radiochemical purity was determined by the following method.</p><h3>Determination of Radiochemical Purity in Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Figure 1 TLC Plate Diagram</span></p><p><span class="Sup">1</span>The ethanol used in this procedure should be 95% or greater. Absolute ethanol (99%) should remain at ≥ 95% ethanol content for one week after opening if stored tightly capped, in a cool dry place.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Kit for Preparation of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi Injection is supplied as a lyophilized mixture in a 5 mL vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Warnings</h3><p class="First">In studying patients in whom cardiac disease is known or suspected, care should be taken to assure continuous monitoring and treatment in accordance with safe, accepted clinical procedure. Infrequently, death has occurred 4 to 24 hours after Tc 99m Sestamibi use and is usually associated with exercise stress testing [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><p>Pharmacologic induction of cardiovascular stress may be associated with serious adverse events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction and cerebrovascular events. Caution should be used when pharmacologic stress is selected as an alternative to exercise; it should be used when indicated and in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agent’s labeling.</p><p>Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi has been rarely associated with acute severe allergic and anaphylactic events of angioedema and generalized urticaria. In some patients the allergic symptoms developed on the second injection during Tc 99m Sestamibi imaging. Patients who receive Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi for either myocardial or breast imaging are receiving the same drug. Caution should be exercised and emergency equipment should be available when administering Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi. Also, before administering Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi Injection, patients should be asked about the possibility of allergic reactions to the drug.</p><h3>General Precautions</h3><p class="First">The contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi and are not to be administered directly to the patient without first undergoing the preparative procedure.</p><p>Radioactive drugs must be handled with care and appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize radiation exposure to clinical personnel. Also, care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the patients consistent with proper patient management.</p><p>Contents of the kit before preparation are not radioactive. However, after the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is added, adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained. The components of the kit are sterile and non-pyrogenic. It is essential to follow directions carefully and to adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation.</p><p>Technetium Tc 99m labeling reactions depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state. Hence, Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection containing oxidants should not be used.</p><p>Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi should not be used more than six hours after preparation.</p><p>Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides.</p><p>Stress testing should be performed only under the supervision of a qualified physician and in a laboratory equipped with appropriate resuscitation and support apparatus.</p><p>The most frequent exercise stress test endpoints sufficient to stop the test reported during controlled studies (two-thirds were cardiac patients) were:</p><p class="First">Fatigue</p><p class="First">35%</p><p class="First">Dyspnea</p><p class="First">17%</p><p class="First">Chest Pain</p><p class="First">16%</p><p class="First">ST-depression</p><p class="First">7%</p><p class="First">Arrhythmia</p><p class="First">1%</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse events were evaluated in 3741 adults who were evaluated in clinical studies.

A few cases of flushing, edema, injection site inflammation, dry mouth, fever, pruritus, rash, urticaria and fatigue have also been attributed to administration of the agent.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Specific drug-drug interactions have not been studied.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi. It is also not known whether Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. There have been no studies in pregnant women. Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Technetium Tc 99m Pertechnetate is excreted in human milk during lactation. It is not known whether Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi is excreted in human milk. Therefore, formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established.</p><p>No evidence of diagnostic efficacy or clinical utility of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi scan was found in clinical studies of children and adolescents with Kawasaki disease.</p><p>A prospective study of 445 pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease was designed to determine the predictive value of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging to define a pediatric population with Kawasaki disease that was at risk of developing cardiac events. Cardiac events were defined as cardiac death, MI, hospitalization due to cardiac etiology, heart failure, CABG or coronary angioplasty. The standard of truth was defined as cardiac events occurring 6 months following the administration of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi. Only three cardiac events were observed at six months in this study. In all three cases, the scan was negative. No clinically meaningful measurements of sensitivity, specificity or other diagnostic performance parameters could be demonstrated in this study.</p><p>A ten year retrospective case history study of pediatric Kawasaki disease patients who completed Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging and who had coronary angiography within three months of the Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi scan was designed to measure sensitivity and specificity of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi scan. Out of 72 patients who had both evaluable Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi scans and evaluable angiographic images, only one patient had both an abnormal angiogram and an abnormal Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi scan. No clinically meaningful measurements of sensitivity, specificity or other diagnostic performance parameters could be demonstrated in this study.</p><p>In a clinical pharmacology study, 46 pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease received Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi administration at the following doses: 0.1–0.2 mCi/kg for rest, 0.3 mCi/kg for stress in one day studies; 0.2 mCi/kg for rest and 0.2 mCi/kg for stress in two day studies.</p><p>The radioactivity both in younger children and in adolescents exhibited PK profiles similar to those previously reported in adults [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12)</span>].</p><p>The radiation absorbed doses in adolescents, both at rest and stress, were similar to those observed in adults [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>]. When comparing weight-adjusted radioactivity (up to 0.3 mCi/kg) doses administered to adolescents and younger children to the recommended dose administered to adults (up to 30 mCi), the radiation absorbed doses in both adolescents and younger children were similar to those in adults.</p><p>Adverse events were evaluated in 609 pediatric patients from the three clinical studies described above. The frequency and the type of the adverse events were similar to the ones observed in the studies of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi in adults. Two of the 609 had a serious adverse event: one patient received a Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi overdose but remained asymptomatic, and one patient had an asthma exacerbation following administration.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of 3068 patients in clinical studies of Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi for myocardial imaging, 693 patients were 65 or older and 121 were 75 or older.</p><p>Of 673 patients in clinical studies of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi for breast imaging, 138 patients were 65 or older and 30 were 75 or older.</p><p>Based on the evaluation of the frequency of adverse events and review of vital signs data, no overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Not applicable.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Not applicable.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Not applicable.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The clinical consequences of overdosing with Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi are not known.</p><h2>Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi Description</h2><p class="First">Each 5 mL vial contains a sterile, non-pyrogenic, lyophilized mixture of:</p><p>Prior to lyophilization the pH is 5.3 to 5.9.

To facilitate control of the radiation exposure from Megabequerel (millicurie) amounts of this radionuclide, the use of a 0.25 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of 1,000.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Shield Thickness (Pb) cm</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Coefficient of Attenuation</span></p><p class="First">0.017</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.08</p><p class="First">10<span class="Sup">–1</span></p><p class="First">0.16</p><p class="First">10<span class="Sup">–2</span></p><p class="First">0.25</p><p class="First">10<span class="Sup">–3</span></p><p class="First">0.33</p><p class="First">10<span class="Sup">–4</span></p><p>To correct for physical decay of this radionuclide, the fractions that remain at selected intervals after the time of calibration are shown in Table 5.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hours</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fraction Remaining</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hours</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Fraction Remaining</span></p><p class="First">0*</p><p class="First">1.000</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">0.447</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.891</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">0.398</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">0.794</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">0.355</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">0.708</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">0.316</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">0.631</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">0.282</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">0.562</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">0.251</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">0.501</p><p class="First"> </p><p class="First"> </p><h2>Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi is a cationic Tc 99m complex which has been found to accumulate in viable myocardial tissue in a manner analogous to that of thallous chloride Tl-201. Scintigraphic images obtained in humans after the intravenous administration of the drug have been comparable to those obtained with thallous chloride Tl-201 in normal and abnormal myocardial tissue.</p><p>Animal studies have shown that myocardial uptake is not blocked when the sodium pump mechanism is inhibited. Although studies of subcellular fractionation and electron micrographic analysis of heart cell aggregates suggest that Tc 99m Sestamibi cellular retention occurs specifically within the mitochondria as a result of electrostatic interactions, the clinical relevance of these findings has not been determined.</p><p>The mechanism of Tc 99m Sestamibi localization in various types of breast tissue (e.g., benign, inflammatory, malignant, fibrous) has not been established.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary activity is negligible even immediately after injection. Blood clearance studies indicate that the fast clearing component clears with a t<span class="Sub">1⁄2</span> of 4.3 minutes at rest, and clears with a t<span class="Sub">1⁄2</span> of 1.6 minutes under exercise conditions. At five minutes post injection about 8% of the injected dose remains in circulation. There is less than 1% protein binding of technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi in plasma. The myocardial biological half-life is approximately six hours after a rest or exercise injection. The biological half-life for the liver is approximately 30 minutes after a rest or exercise injection. The effective half-life of clearance (which includes both the biological half-life and radionuclide decay) for the heart is approximately 3 hours, and for the liver is approximately 30 minutes, after a rest or exercise injection. The ideal imaging time reflects the best compromise between heart count rate and surrounding organ uptake.</p><p>Myocardial uptake which is coronary flow dependent is 1.2% of the injected dose at rest and 1.5% of the injected dose at exercise. Table 6 illustrates the biological clearance as well as effective clearance (which includes biological clearance and radionuclide decay) of Tc 99m Sestamibi from the heart and liver.</p><p>[Organ concentrations expressed as percentage of injected dose; data based on an average of 5 subjects at rest and 5 subjects during exercise.]</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">REST</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">STRESS</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Heart</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Liver</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Heart</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Liver</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Time</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Biological</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effective</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Biological</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effective</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Biological</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effective</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Biological</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effective</span></p><p class="First">5 min.</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">19.6</p><p class="First">19.4</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">5.9</p><p class="First">5.8</p><p class="First">30 min.</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">12.2</p><p class="First">11.5</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">4.5</p><p class="First">4.2</p><p class="First">1 hour</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">5.6</p><p class="First">5.0</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">2.1</p><p class="First">2 hours</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">2.2</p><p class="First">1.7</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">0.7</p><p class="First">4 hours</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.7</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p>A study in a dog myocardial ischemia model reported that Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi undergoes myocardial distribution (redistribution), although more slowly and less completely than thallous chloride Tl-201. A study in a dog myocardial infarction model reported that the drug showed no redistribution of any consequence. Definitive human studies to demonstrate possible redistribution have not been reported. In patients with documented myocardial infarction, imaging revealed the infarct up to four hours post dose.</p><p>Metabolism</p><p>The agent is excreted without any evidence of metabolism.</p><p>Elimination</p><p>The major pathway for clearance of Tc 99m Sestamibi is the hepatobiliary system. Activity from the gall bladder appears in the intestines within one hour of injection. Twenty-seven percent of the injected dose is excreted in the urine, and approximately thirty-three percent of the injected dose is cleared through the feces in 48 hours.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In comparison with most other diagnostic technetium labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the radiation dose to the ovaries (1.5 rads/30 mCi at rest, 1.2 rads/30 mCi at exercise) is high. Minimal exposure (ALARA) is necessary in women of childbearing capability [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><p>The active intermediate, Cu(MIBI)<span class="Sub">4</span>BF<span class="Sub">4</span>, was evaluated for genotoxic potential in a battery of five tests. No genotoxic activity was observed in the Ames, CHO/HPRT and sister chromatid exchange tests (all in vitro). At cytotoxic concentrations (&gt; 20 µg/mL), an increase in cells with chromosome aberrations was observed in the in vitro human lymphocyte assay. Cu(MIBI)<span class="Sub">4</span>BF<span class="Sub">4</span> did not show genotoxic effects in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test at a dose which caused systemic and bone marrow toxicity (9 mg/kg, &gt; 600 × maximal human dose).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">CLINICAL TRIALS:</p><p>MYOCARDIAL IMAGING: In a trial of rest and stress Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi imaging, the relationship of normal or abnormal perfusion scans and long term cardiac events was evaluated in 521 patients (511 men, 10 women) with stable chest pain. There were 73.9% Caucasians, 25.9% Blacks and 0.2% Asians. The mean age was 59.6 years (range: 29 to 84 years). All patients had a baseline rest and exercise Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi scan and were followed for 13.2 ± 4.9 months (range: 1 to 24 months). Images were correlated with the occurrence of a cardiac event (cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial infarction). In this trial as summarized in Table 7, 24/521 (4.6%) had a cardiac event.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Baseline Scan</span>*</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Proportion of patients with<br/>

Disease localization isolated to the apex has not been established. Tc 99m Sestamibi has not been studied or evaluated in cardiac disorders other than coronary artery disease.</p><p>BREAST IMAGING: Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi was evaluated in two multicenter, clinical trials of a total of 673 women patients. Overall the mean age was 52 (range 23 to 87 years). The racial and ethnic representation was 70% Caucasian, 15% African-American, 14% Hispanic and 1% Asian.</p><p>Both clinical studies evaluated women who were referred for further evaluation for either: 1) a mammographically detected (with varying degrees of malignant likelihood) but not palpable breast lesion (study A, n=387, mean age = 54 years), or 2) a palpable breast lesion (study B, n=286, mean age = 50 years). In both studies all patients were scheduled for biopsy.</p><p>Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi (20–30 mCi) was injected intravenously in a vein that was contralateral to the breast lesion in question. Planar imaging was completed with a high resolution collimator with a 10% window centered at 140 keV, and 128 x 128 matrix. An initial marker image, that was not used in the data analysis, was obtained using a cobalt Co57 point source as a marker of a palpable mass. Images were obtained 5 minutes after injection as follows: lateral image of the affected breast for 10 minutes, lateral image of the contralateral breast for 10 minutes, and an anterior image of both breasts for 10 minutes. For the lateral image the patients were positioned in a prone position. For the anterior image, the patients were supine. The Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi scintigraphic images were read in a randomized method by two groups of three blinded readers. Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi uptake was scored as: normal (no uptake), equivocal, low, moderate, or high uptake. The results of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi images and mammography were analyzed in comparison to histopathologic findings of malignant or non-malignant disease.</p><p>As shown in Table 8 for the 483 evaluable patients, the sensitivity and specificity of any degree of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi uptake appear to vary with the presence or absence of palpable mass.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">STATISTIC</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study A<br/>

As shown in Table 9 and Table 10, the majority of the normal Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi images are associated with non-malignant tissue (78–81%) and the majority of low, moderate or high uptake Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi images are associated with malignant disease (79–83%). In an individual patient, however, the intensity of Technetium TC 99M Sestamibi uptake can not be used to confirm the presence or absence of malignancy.
