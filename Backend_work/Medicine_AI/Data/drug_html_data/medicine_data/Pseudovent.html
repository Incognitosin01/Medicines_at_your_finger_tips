It helps loosen congestion in your chest and throat, making it easier to cough out through your mouth.</p><p>Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages. Dilated blood vessels can cause nasal congestion (stuffy nose).</p><p>Pseudovent is used to treat nasal and sinus congestion, and to reduce chest congestion caused by the common cold, infections, or allergies.</p><p>Pseudovent may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Before taking Pseudovent, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any drugs, or if you have:</p><ul>
