Syndrome usually appears within several hours to 2 days following treatment; usually resolves within several days after product is discontinued. Female patients or patients with a migraine history may be at higher risk for AMS.</p><p>• Hemolysis: IGIV has been associated with antiglobulin hemolysis (acute or delayed). Cases of hemolysis-related renal impairment/failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have been reported. Risk factors associated with hemolysis include high doses (≥2 g/kg) given either as a single administration or divided over several days, underlying associated inflammatory conditions, and non-O blood type (FDA 2012). An underlying inflammatory state (eg, elevated C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate) may also increase the risk. Closely monitor patients for signs of hemolytic anemia, particularly in patients with preexisting anemia and/or cardiovascular or pulmonary compromise.</p><p>• Hyperproteinemia: Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia may occur; distinguish hyponatremia from pseudohyponatremia to prevent volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity and a higher risk of thrombotic events.</p><p>• Infusion reactions: Patients should be monitored for adverse events during and after the infusion. Stop administration with signs of infusion reaction (fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and rarely shock). With other immune globulin products, risk may be increased with initial treatment, when switching brands of immune globulin, and with treatment interruptions of &gt;8 weeks.</p><p>• Pulmonary edema: Monitor for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI); noncardiogenic pulmonary edema has been reported with IGIV use. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and fever in the presence of normal left ventricular function. Usually occurs within 1 to 6 hours after infusion.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Acute renal dysfunction (increased serum creatinine, oliguria, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis) can rarely occur and has been associated with fatalities in predisposed patients. Patients predisposed to renal dysfunction include patients with renal disease, diabetes mellitus, hypovolemia, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, and nephrotoxic medications due to risk of renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV products containing sucrose. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction or acute renal failure, ensure adequate hydration prior to administration; the dose, rate of infusion, and concentration of solution should be minimized. Assess renal function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. Discontinue if renal function deteriorates.</p><p>• Thrombotic events: Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products even in the absence of risk factors for thrombosis. For patients at risk of thrombosis (eg, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, cardiovascular risk factors, use of estrogens, prolonged immobilization, and advanced age), administer at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, such as those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/severe hypertriglyceridemia, or monoclonal gammopathies.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution; ensure adequate hydration prior to administration; the rate of infusion and concentration of solution should be minimized.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Adults: Not indicated for use in adults.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents (eg, viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease [vCJD] agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt Jakob disease [CJD] agent) that could transmit disease, including unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Administration: For IV infusion only; do not exceed recommended rate of administration.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Renal function (BUN, serum creatinine, urinary output); vital signs (continuously during infusion); signs and/or symptoms of allergic reaction (continuously during infusion); aseptic meningitis syndrome (may occur hours to days following IGIV therapy); signs of relapse (may occur up to 1 month following recovery)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Botulism immune globulin is only indicated for use in infants &lt;1 year of age.</p><h2>More about botulism immune globulin</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
