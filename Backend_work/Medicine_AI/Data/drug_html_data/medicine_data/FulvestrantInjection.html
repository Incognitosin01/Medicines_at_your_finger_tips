Pull the cap (A) off in a straight upward direction. DO NOT TOUCH THE STERILE SYRINGE TIP (Luer-Lok) (B) (see Figure 2).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><p>7. Attach the safety needle to the syringe tip (Luer-Lok). Twist needle until firmly seated (see Figure 3). Confirm that the needle is locked to the Luer connector before moving or tilting the syringe out of the vertical plane to avoid spillage of syringe contents.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 3</span></p><p>For Administration:</p><p>8.   Pull shield straight off needle to avoid damaging needle point.</p><p>9.   Remove needle sheath.</p><p>10. Expel excess gas from the syringe (a small gas bubble may remain).</p><p>11. Administer intramuscularly slowly (1 to 2 minutes/injection) into the buttock (gluteal area). For user convenience, the needle ‘bevel up’ position is orientated to the lever arm, as shown in Figure 4.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4</span></p><p>12. After injection, immediately activate the lever arm to deploy the needle shielding by applying a single-</p><p>finger stroke to the activation assisted lever arm to push the lever arm completely forward. Listen for a click. Confirm that the needle shielding has completely covered the needle (see Figure 5).</p><p>NOTE: Activate away from self and others.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 5</span></p><p>13. Discard the empty syringe into an approved sharps collector in accordance with applicable regulations and institutional policy.</p><p>14.

Hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria and angioedema, have been reported in association with fulvestrant <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Because fulvestrant is administered intramuscularly, it should be used with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or anticoagulant use.</p><h3>Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The safety and pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant were evaluated in a study in seven subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) and seven subjects with normal hepatic function. Exposure was increased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, therefore, a dose of 250 mg is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><p>Fulvestrant has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><h3>Injection Site Reaction</h3><p class="First">Injection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy have been reported with Fulvestrant Injection. Caution should be taken while administering fulvestrant at the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve <span class="Italics">[see  Dosage and Administration (2.3) </span> and <span class="Italics"> Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, fulvestrant can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of fulvestrant to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at daily doses that are significantly less than the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with fulvestrant and for one year after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1),  (8.3) </span> and  <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].</span></p><h3>Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol</h3><p class="First">Due to structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, fulvestrant can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay, resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Risk of Bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></li>
<li>Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></li>

Although, fulvestrant is metabolized by CYP3A4 <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, drug interactions studies with ketoconazole or rifampin did not alter fulvestrant pharmacokinetics.

In animal reproduction studies, administration of fulvestrant to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including skeletal malformations and fetal loss, at daily doses that were 6% and 30% of the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span></span></p><p>Administration of fulvestrant to rats prior to and up to implantation caused embryonic loss at daily doses that were 0.6% of the daily maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>. When fulvestrant was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, intramuscular doses ≥0.1 mg/kg/day (6% of the human recommended dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) caused effects on embryo-fetal development consistent with its antiestrogenic activity. Fulvestrant caused an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities in rats (tarsal flexure of the hind paw at 2 mg/kg/day; equivalent to the human dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) and non-ossification of the odontoid and ventral tubercle of the first cervical vertebra at doses ≥0.1 mg/kg/day. Fulvestrant administered at 2 mg/kg/day caused fetal loss.</p><p>When administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, fulvestrant caused pregnancy loss at an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the human dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>). Further, at 0.25 mg/kg/day (30% the human dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>), fulvestrant caused increases in placental weight and post-implantation loss in rabbits. Fulvestrant was associated with an increased incidence of fetal variations in rabbits (backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle, and 27 pre-sacral vertebrae at 0.25 mg/kg/day; 30% the human dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) when administered during the period of organogenesis.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of fulvestrant in human milk, nor of its effects on milk production or breastfed infant. Fulvestrant can be detected in rat milk <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span> Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from fulvestrant, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with fulvestrant and for one year after the final dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Levels of fulvestrant were approximately 12-fold higher in milk than in plasma after exposure of lactating rats to a dose of 2 mg/kg. Drug exposure in rodent pups from fulvestrant-treated lactating dams was estimated as 10% of the administered dose. In a study in rats of fulvestrant at 10 mg/kg given twice or 15 mg/kg given once (less than the recommended human dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) during lactation, offspring survival was slightly reduced.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span></p><p>Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within seven days prior to initiating fulvestrant.</p><p><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Females</span></span></p><p>Fulvestrant can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span> Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for one year after the last dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Based on animal studies, fulvestrant may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential.

A multi-center, single-arm, open-label, study of fulvestrant was conducted in 30 girls with McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS) associated with Progressive Precocious Puberty (PPP). The median age at informed consent was 6 years old (range: 1 to 8).</p><p>The first 10 patients initially received fulvestrant 2 mg/kg. Based on PK data from the first 6 patients, all 10 patients receiving 2 mg/kg were escalated to a dose of 4 mg/kg and all other patients received 4 mg/kg from study entry.</p><p>Baseline measurements for vaginal bleeding days, bone age, growth velocity, and Tanner staging for at least 6 months prior to study entry were provided retrospectively by the parent, guardian, or local consultant. All measurements during the study period were collected prospectively. Patients’ baseline characteristics included the following: a mean ± SD chronological age of 5.9 ± 1.8 years; a mean rate of bone age advancement (change in bone age in years divided by change in chronological age in years) of 2.0 ± 1.03; and a mean growth velocity z-score of 2.4 ± 3.26.</p><p>Twenty-nine of 30 patients completed the 12-month study period. The following results were observed: 35% (95% CI: 16%, 57%) of the 23 patients with baseline vaginal bleeding experienced a complete cessation of vaginal bleeding on-treatment (month 0 to 12); a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement during the 12-month study period compared to baseline (mean change = -0.9 [95% CI: -1.4, -0.4]); and a reduction in mean growth velocity Z-score on-treatment compared to baseline (mean change = -1.1 [95% CI: -2.7, 0.4]). There were no clinically meaningful changes in median Tanner stage (breast or pubic), mean uterine volume, or mean ovarian volume, or predicted adult height (PAH) on-treatment compared to baseline. The effect of fulvestrant on bone mineral density in children has not been studied and is not known.</p><p>Eight patients (27%) experienced adverse reactions that were considered possibly related to fulvestrant. These included injection site reactions (inflammation, pain, hematoma, pruritus, rash), abdominal pain, contusion, tachycardia, hot flash, extremity pain, and vomiting. Nine (30%) patients reported an SAE, none of which were considered related to fulvestrant. No patients discontinued study treatment due to an AE and no patients died.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant was characterized using a population pharmacokinetic analysis with sparse samples per patient obtained from 30 female pediatric patients aged 1 to 8 years with PPP associated with MAS. Pharmacokinetic data from 294 postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received 125 or 250 mg monthly dosing regimen were also included in the analysis.</p><p>In these pediatric patients receiving 4 mg/kg monthly intramuscular dose of fulvestrant, the geometric mean (SD) CL/F was 444 (165) mL/min which was 32% lower than adults. The geometric mean (SD) steady-state trough concentration (C <span class="Sub">min,ss</span>) and AUC <span class="Sub">ss</span> was 4.19 (0.87) ng/mL and 3680 (1020) ng*hr/mL, respectively.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">For fulvestrant 250 mg, when tumor response was considered by age, objective responses were seen in 22% and 24% of patients under 65 years of age and in 11% and 16% of patients 65 years of age and older, who were treated with fulvestrant in Study 0021 and Study 0020, respectively.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Fulvestrant is metabolized primarily in the liver.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant were evaluated after a single dose of 100 mg in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function (n=7 subjects/group), using a shorter-acting intramuscular injection formulation. Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) had comparable mean AUC and clearance values to those with normal hepatic function. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the average AUC of fulvestrant increased by 70% compared to patients with normal hepatic function. AUC was positively correlated with total bilirubin concentration (p = 0.012). Fulvestrant has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).</p><p>A dose of fulvestrant 250 mg is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) <span class="Italics">[see  Dosage and Administration (2.2) </span> and <span class="Italics"> Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Negligible amounts of fulvestrant are eliminated in urine; therefore, a study in patients with renal impairment was not conducted. In the advanced breast cancer trials, fulvestrant concentrations in women with estimated creatinine clearance as low as 30 mL/min were similar to women with normal creatinine.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Human experience of overdose with fulvestrant is limited. There are isolated reports of overdose with fulvestrant in humans. No adverse reactions were seen in healthy male and female volunteers who received intravenous fulvestrant, which resulted in peak plasma concentrations at the end of the infusion, that were approximately 10 to 15 times those seen after intramuscular injection. The potential toxicity of fulvestrant at these or higher concentrations in cancer patients who may have additional comorbidities is unknown. There is no specific treatment in the event of fulvestrant overdose, and symptoms of overdose are not established. In the event of an overdose, healthcare practitioners should follow general supportive measures and should treat symptomatically.</p><h2>Fulvestrant Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Fulvestrant Injection for intramuscular administration is an estrogen receptor antagonist. The chemical name is 7-alpha-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-penta fluoropentylsulphinyl) nonyl]estra-1,3,5-(10)- triene-3,17-beta-diol. The molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">32</span>H <span class="Sub">47</span>F <span class="Sub">5</span>O <span class="Sub">3</span>S and its structural formula is:</p><p>Fulvestrant, USP is a white powder with a molecular weight of 606.77. The solution for injection is a clear, colorless to yellow, viscous liquid.</p><p>Fulvestrant Injection is supplied as two 5 mL clear glass barrels, each containing 250 mg/5 mL of Fulvestrant Injection solution for intramuscular injection. Each injection contains as inactive ingredients: 12.29% v/v Alcohol, USP; 10% w/v Benzyl Alcohol, NF; 15% w/v Benzyl Benzoate, USP as co-solvents; and made up to 100% w/v with Castor Oil, USP as a co-solvent and release rate modifier.</p><h2>Fulvestrant Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Many breast cancers have estrogen receptors (ER) and the growth of these tumors can be stimulated by estrogen. Fulvestrant is an estrogen receptor antagonist that binds to the estrogen receptor in a competitive manner with affinity comparable to that of estradiol and downregulates the ER protein in human breast cancer cells.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrated that fulvestrant is a reversible inhibitor of the growth of tamoxifen-resistant, as well as estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. In <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> tumor studies, fulvestrant delayed the establishment of tumors from xenografts of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in nude mice. Fulvestrant inhibited the growth of established MCF-7 xenografts and of tamoxifen-resistant breast tumor xenografts.</p><p>Fulvestrant showed no agonist-type effects in <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> uterotrophic assays in immature or ovariectomized mice and rats. In <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies in immature rats and ovariectomized monkeys, fulvestrant blocked the uterotrophic action of estradiol. In postmenopausal women, the absence of changes in plasma concentrations of FSH and LH in response to fulvestrant treatment (250 mg monthly) suggests no peripheral steroidal effects.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a clinical study in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer treated with single doses of fulvestrant 15 to 22 days prior to surgery, there was evidence of increasing down-regulation of ER with increasing dose. This was associated with a dose-related decrease in the expression of the progesterone receptor, an estrogen-regulated protein. These effects on the ER pathway were also associated with a decrease in Ki67 labeling index, a marker of cell proliferation.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span></p><p>The single dose and multiple dose PK parameters for the 500 mg dosing regimen with an additional dose (AD) at Day 15 are reported in Table 11. The additional dose of fulvestrant given two weeks after the initial dose allows for steady-state concentrations to be reached within the first month of dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 11: Summary of Fulvestrant Pharmacokinetic Parameters [gMean (CV%)] in Postmenopausal Advanced Breast Cancer Patients after Intramuscular Administration 500 mg + AD Dosing Regimen</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C <span class="Sub">max</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(ng/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C <span class="Sub">min</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(ng/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(ng.hr/mL)</span></p><p class="First">500 mg + AD <span class="Italics"><span class="Sup">1</span></span></p><p class="First">Single dose</p><p class="First">25.1 (35.3)</p><p class="First">16.3 (25.9)</p><p class="First">11400 (33.4)</p><p class="First">Multiple dose steady-state <span class="Italics"><span class="Sup">2</span></span></p><p class="First">28.0 (27.9)</p><p class="First">12.2 (21.7)</p><p class="First">13100 (23.4)</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">1.</span>    Additional 500 mg dose given on Day 15</p><p><span class="Sup">2.</span>    Month 3</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution at steady-state is approximately 3 to 5 L/kg. This suggests that distribution is largely extravascular. Fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins; VLDL, LDL and HDL lipoprotein fractions appear to be the major binding components. The role of sex hormone-binding globulin, if any, could not be determined.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span></p><p>Biotransformation and disposition of fulvestrant in humans have been determined following intramuscular and intravenous administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled fulvestrant. Metabolism of fulvestrant appears to involve combinations of a number of possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids, including oxidation, aromatic hydroxylation, conjugation with glucuronic acid and/or sulphate at the 2, 3 and 17 positions of the steroid nucleus, and oxidation of the side chain sulphoxide. Identified metabolites are either less active or exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in antiestrogen models.</p><p>Studies using human liver preparations and recombinant human enzymes indicate that cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) is the only P-450 isoenzyme involved in the oxidation of fulvestrant; however, the relative contribution of P-450 and non-P-450 routes <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion:</span></p><p>Fulvestrant was rapidly cleared by the hepatobiliary route with excretion primarily via the feces (approximately 90%). Renal elimination was negligible (less than 1%). After an intramuscular injection of 250 mg, the clearance (Mean ± SD) was 690 ± 226 mL/min with an apparent half-life about 40 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric:</span></p><p>In patients with breast cancer, there was no difference in fulvestrant pharmacokinetic profile related to age (range 33 to 89 years).</p><p><span class="Bold">Gender:</span></p><p>Following administration of a single intravenous dose, there were no pharmacokinetic differences between men and women or between premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Similarly, there were no differences between men and postmenopausal women after intramuscular administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race:</span></p><p>In the advanced breast cancer treatment trials, the potential for pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been evaluated in 294 women including 87.4% Caucasian, 7.8% Black, and 4.4% Hispanic. No differences in fulvestrant plasma pharmacokinetics were observed among these groups. In a separate trial, pharmacokinetic data from postmenopausal ethnic Japanese women were similar to those obtained in non-Japanese patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions:</span></p><p>There are no known drug-drug interactions. Fulvestrant does not significantly inhibit any of the major CYP isoenzymes, including CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, and studies of co-administration of fulvestrant with midazolam indicate that therapeutic doses of fulvestrant have no inhibitory effects on CYP 3A4 or alter blood levels of drug metabolized by that enzyme. Although fulvestrant is partly metabolized by CYP 3A4, a clinical study with rifampin, an inducer of CYP 3A4, showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant. Also, results from a healthy volunteer study with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4, indicated that ketoconazole had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant and dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients co-prescribed CYP 3A4 inhibitors or inducers <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no clinically relevant drug interaction when fulvestrant is co-administered with palbociclib, abemaciclib, or ribociclib.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Two-year carcinogenesis studies were conducted in rats and mice. Positive findings were observed in both species. Rats were treated at intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg/30 days, 10 mg/rat/30 days and 10 mg/rat/15 days.</p><p>These doses correspond to 0.9-, 1.5-, and 3-fold (in females) and 0.8-, 0.8-, and 2-fold (in males) the systemic exposure [AUC <span class="Sub">0-30 days</span>] achieved in women receiving the recommended dose of 500 mg/month. An increased incidence of benign ovarian granulosa cell tumors and testicular Leydig cell tumors was evident, in females dosed at 10 mg/rat/15 days and males dosed at 15 mg/rat/30 days, respectively. Mice were treated at oral doses of 0, 20, 150 and 500 mg/kg/day. These doses correspond to 0-, 0.8-, 8.4- and 18-fold (in females) and 0.8-, 7.1- and 11.9-fold (in males), the systemic exposure (AUC <span class="Sub">0-30 days</span>) achieved in women receiving the recommended dose of 500 mg/month. There was an increased incidence of sex cord stromal tumors (both benign and malignant) in the ovary of mice at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg/day. Induction of such tumors is consistent with the pharmacology-related endocrine feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused by an antiestrogen.</p><p>Fulvestrant was not mutagenic or clastogenic in multiple <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests with and without the addition of a mammalian liver metabolic activation factor (bacterial mutation assay in strains of <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cytogenetics study in human lymphocytes, mammalian cell mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test in rat).</p><p>In female rats, fulvestrant administered at doses ≥0.01 mg/kg/day (0.6% the human recommended dose based on body surface area [BSA in mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>]), for 2 weeks prior to and for 1 week following mating, caused a reduction in fertility and embryonic survival. No adverse effects on female fertility and embryonic survival were evident in female animals dosed at 0.001 mg/kg/day (0.06% the human dose based on BSA in mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>). Restoration of female fertility to values similar to controls was evident following a 29-day withdrawal period after dosing at 2 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the human dose based on BSA in mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>). The effects of fulvestrant on the fertility of female rats appear to be consistent with its antiestrogenic activity. The potential effects of fulvestrant on the fertility of male animals were not studied, but in a 6-month toxicology study, male rats treated with intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg/30 days, 10 mg/rat/30 days, or 10 mg/rat/15 days fulvestrant showed a loss of spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules, seminiferous tubular atrophy, and degenerative changes in the epididymides. Changes in the testes and epididymides had not recovered 20 weeks after cessation of dosing. These fulvestrant doses correspond to 1.3-, 1.2- and 3.5-fold the systemic exposure [AUC <span class="Sub">0-30 days</span>] achieved in women receiving the recommended dose of 500 mg/month.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of fulvestrant 500 mg versus fulvestrant 250 mg was compared in CONFIRM.

Fulvestrant 500 mg was administered intramuscularly on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter, with either ribociclib 600 mg or placebo given orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measure for the study was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.</p><p>Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 31 to 89). Of the patients enrolled, 47% were 65 years and older, including 14% age 75 years and older. The patients enrolled were primarily Caucasian (85%), Asian (9%), and Black (0.7%). Nearly all patients (99.7%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. First- and second-line patients were enrolled in this study (of which 19% had <span class="Italics">de novo</span> metastatic disease). Forty-three percent (43%) of patients had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant vs. 13% in the neoadjuvant setting and 59% had received endocrine therapy in the adjuvant vs. 1% in the neoadjuvant setting prior to study entry. Twenty-one percent (21%) of patients had bone-only disease and 61% had visceral disease. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between study arms.</p><p>The efficacy results from MONALEESA-3 are summarized in Table 17, Figure 13, and Figure 14.
