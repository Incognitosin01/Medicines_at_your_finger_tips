</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonist</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Wytensin</h2><p>Guanabenz belongs to the general class of medicines called antihypertensives. It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).</p><p>High blood pressure adds to the work load of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.</p><p>Guanabenz works by controlling nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, it relaxes blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. This helps to lower blood pressure.</p><p>Guanabenz is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Wytensin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
