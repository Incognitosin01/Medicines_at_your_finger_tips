A dose of 2 sprays (50 mcg of mometasone furoate in each spray) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose of 200 mcg) is also effective in some patients.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg is a metered-dose, manual pump spray unit containing an aqueous suspension of mometasone furoate, USP.</p><p>After initial priming (10 actuations), each actuation of the pump delivers a metered spray containing 100 mg or 100 microliter of suspension containing 50 mcg of mometasone furoate. Each bottle of mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg provides 120 sprays.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Mometasone furoate nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to mometasone furoate or any of its ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Local Nasal Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Epistaxis</span></p><p>In clinical studies, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients with allergic rhinitis with mometasone furoate nasal spray than those who received placebo [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Candida</span></span> <span class="Bold">Infection</span></p><p>In clinical studies with  mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> has occurred. When such an infection develops, use of  mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg should be discontinued and appropriate local or systemic therapy instituted, if needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nasal Septum Perforation</span></p><p>Instances of nasal septum perforation have been reported following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. As with any long-term topical treatment of the nasal cavity, patients using mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg over several months or longer should be examined periodically for possible changes in the nasal mucosa.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impaired Wound Healing</span></p><p>Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal septum ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use a nasal corticosteroid until healing has occurred.</p><h3>5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts</h3><p class="First">Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.</p><p>Glaucoma and cataract formation was evaluated in one controlled study of 12 weeks’ duration and one uncontrolled study of 12 months’ duration in patients treated with  mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg at 200 mcg/day, using intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examination. No significant change from baseline was noted in the mean intraocular pressure measurements for the 141  mometasone furoate-treated patients in the 12-week study, as compared with 141 placebo-treated patients. No individual  mometasone furoate-treated patient was noted to have developed a significant elevation in intraocular pressure or cataracts in this 12-week study. Likewise, no significant change from baseline was noted in the mean intraocular pressure measurements for the 139 mometasone furoate -treated patients in the 12-month study and again, no cataracts were detected in these patients. Nonetheless, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts.</p><h3>5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions including instances of wheezing may occur after the intranasal administration of mometasone furoate. Discontinue mometasone furoate  nasal spray if such reactions occur [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span></span>].</p><h3>5.4 Immunosuppression</h3><p class="First">Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in nonimmune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infection of the respiratory tract, or in untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral infections, or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections.</p><h3>5.5 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effect</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</span></p><p>When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of mometasone furoate  nasal spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy.</p><h3>5.6 Effect on Growth</h3><p class="First">Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving mometasone furoate nasal spray. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate nasal spray, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Epistaxis, ulcerations, <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> infection, impaired wound healing [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>

</ul><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Allergic Rhinitis</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older</span></span></p><p>In controlled US and international clinical studies, a total of 3210 adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older with allergic rhinitis received treatment with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg at doses of 50 to 800 mcg/day. The majority of patients (n = 2103) were treated with 200 mcg/day. A total of 350 adult and adolescent patients have been treated for one year or longer. Adverse events did not differ significantly based on age, sex, or race. Four percent or less of patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment because of adverse events and the discontinuation rate was similar for the vehicle and active comparators.</p><p>All adverse events (regardless of relationship to treatment) reported by 5% or more of adult and adolescent patients ages 12 years and older who received mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg, 200 mcg/day vs. placebo and that were more common with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg than placebo, are displayed in TABLE 1 below.</p><p><span class="Bold">TABLE 1: ADULT AND ADOLESCENT PATIENTS 12 YEARS AND OLDER – ADVERSE EVENTS FROM CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS IN SEASONAL ALLERGIC AND PERENNIAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS (PERCENT OF PATIENTS REPORTING)</span></p><p class="First">MOMETASONE FUROATE200 mcg</p><p>(n = 2103)</p><p class="First">VEHICLE</p><p>PLACEBO</p><p>(n = 1671)</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">26</p><p class="First">22</p><p class="First">Viral Infection</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">Pharyngitis</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Epistaxis/Blood-Tinged Mucus</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">Coughing</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">Upper Respiratory Tract Infection</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Dysmenorrhea</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Musculoskeletal Pain</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Sinusitis</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">3</p><p>Other adverse events which occurred in less than 5% but greater than or equal to 2% of adult and adolescent patients (ages 12 years and older) treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg, 200-mcg/day (regardless of relationship to treatment), and more frequently than in the placebo group included: arthralgia, asthma, bronchitis, chest pain, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, dyspepsia, earache, flu-like symptoms, myalgia, nausea, and rhinitis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric patients &lt;12 years of age</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span></p><p>In controlled US and international studies, a total of 990 pediatric patients (ages 3 to 11 years) with allergic rhinitis received treatment with mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg, at doses of 25 to 200 mcg/day. The majority of pediatric patients (n = 720) were treated with 100 mcg/day. A total of 163 pediatric patients have been treated for one year or longer. Two percent or less of patients in clinical trials who received mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg discontinued treatment because of adverse events and the discontinuation rate was similar for the placebo and active comparators.</p><p>Adverse events which occurred in ≥5% of pediatric patients (ages 3 to 11 years) treated with mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg, 100 mcg/day vs. placebo (regardless of relationship to treatment) and more frequently than in the placebo group included upper respiratory tract infection (5% in  mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg group vs. 4% in placebo) and vomiting (5% in mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg group vs. 4% in placebo).</p><p>Other adverse events which occurred in less than 5% but greater than or equal to 2% of pediatric patients (ages 3 to 11 years) treated mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg, 100 mcg/day vs. placebo (regardless of relationship to treatment) and more frequently than in the placebo group included: diarrhea, nasal irritation, otitis media, and wheezing.</p><p>The adverse event (regardless of relationship to treatment) reported by 5% of pediatric patients ages 2 to 5 years who received mometasone furoate  nasal spray, 50 mcg, 100 mcg/day in a clinical trial vs. placebo including 56 subjects (28 each mometasone furoate  nasal spray, 50 mcg and placebo) and that was more common with mometasone furoate  nasal spray, 50 mcg than placebo, included: upper respiratory tract infection (7% vs. 0%, respectively). The other adverse event which occurred in less than 5% but greater than or equal to 2% of mometasone furoate pediatric patients ages 2 to 5 years treated with 100 mcg doses vs. placebo (regardless of relationship to treatment) and more frequently than in the placebo group included: skin trauma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nasal Polyps</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adults 18 years of age and older</span></span></p><p>In controlled clinical studies, the types of adverse events observed in patients with nasal polyps were similar to those observed for patients with allergic rhinitis. A total of 594 adult patients (ages 18 to 86 years) received mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg at doses of 200 mcg once or twice daily for up to 4 months for treatment of nasal polyps. The overall incidence of adverse events for patients treated with mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg was comparable to patients with the placebo except for epistaxis, which was 9% for 200 mcg once daily, 13% for 200 mcg twice daily, and 5% for the placebo.</p><p>Nasal ulcers and nasal and oral candidiasis were also reported in patients treated with mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg primarily in patients treated for longer than 4 weeks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nasal Congestion Associated with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</span></p><p>A total of 1008 patients aged 12 years and older received mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg 200 mcg/day (n = 506) or placebo (n = 502) for 15 days. Adverse events that occurred more frequently in patients treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg than in patients with the placebo included sinus headache (1.2% in mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg group vs. 0.2% in placebo) and epistaxis (1% in mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg group vs. 0.2% in placebo) and the overall adverse event profile was similar to that observed in the other allergic rhinitis trials.</p><h3>6.2 Post-Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-marketing period for mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg: nasal burning and irritation, anaphylaxis and angioedema, disturbances in taste and smell and nasal septal perforation. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4:</span> Studies have shown that mometasone furoate is primarily and extensively metabolized in the liver of all species investigated and undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites<span class="Italics">. In vitro</span> studies have confirmed the primary role of cytochrome CYP 3A4 in the metabolism of this compound. Coadministration with ketoconazole, a potent CYP 3A4 inhibitor, may increase the plasma concentrations of mometasone furoate [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects:</span> Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg, like other corticosteroids, should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. Experience with oral corticosteroids since their introduction in pharmacologic, as opposed to physiologic, doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. In addition, because there is a natural increase in corticosteroid production during pregnancy, most women will require a lower exogenous corticosteroid dose and many will not need corticosteroid treatment during pregnancy.</p><p>In mice, mometasone furoate caused cleft palate at subcutaneous doses (less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Fetal survival was reduced at approximately 2 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. No toxicity was observed at less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In rats, mometasone furoate produced umbilical hernia at topical dermal doses approximately 10 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. A topical dermal dose approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis produced delays in ossification, but no malformations.</p><p>In rabbits, mometasone furoate caused multiple malformations (e.g., flexed front paws, gallbladder agenesis, umbilical hernia, and hydrocephaly) at topical dermal doses approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In an oral study, mometasone furoate increased resorptions and caused cleft palate and/or head malformations (hydrocephaly or domed head) at approximately 30 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. At approximately 110 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, most litters were aborted or resorbed. No toxicity was observed at approximately 6 times the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>When rats received subcutaneous doses of mometasone furoate throughout pregnancy or during the later stages of pregnancy, a dose less than the MRDID in adults on a mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis caused prolonged and difficult labor and reduced the number of live births, birth weight, and early pup survival.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nonteratogenic Effects:</span> Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born to women receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should be carefully monitored.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known if mometasone furoate is excreted in human milk. Because other corticosteroids are excreted in human milk, caution should be used when mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg is administered to nursing women.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg for allergic rhinitis in children 12 years of age and older have been established [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)</span>].Use of mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg for allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 2 to 11 years of age is supported by safety and efficacy data from clinical studies. Seven hundred and twenty (720) patients 3 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg (100 mcg total daily dose) in controlled clinical trials [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span> Twenty-eight (28) patients 2 to 5 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg (100 mcg total daily dose) in a controlled trial to evaluate safety [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. Safety and effectiveness of mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg for allergic rhinitis in children less than 2 years of age have not been established.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of mometasone furoate nasal spray for the treatment of nasal polyps in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. One 4-month trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mometasone furoate  in the treatment of nasal polyps in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate safety; efficacy parameters were collected as secondary endpoints. A total of 127 patients with nasal polyps were randomized to placebo or mometasone furoate nasal spray 100 mcg once or twice daily (patients 6 to 11 years of age) or 200 mcg once or twice daily (patients 12 to 17 years of age). The results of this trial did not support the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray in the treatment of nasal polyps in pediatric patients. The adverse events reported in this trial were similar to the adverse events reported in patients 18 years of age and older with nasal polyps.</p><p>Controlled clinical studies have shown intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with intranasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for “catch up” growth following discontinuation of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving intranasal corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of safe and effective noncorticosteroid treatment alternatives. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, each patient should be titrated to his/her lowest effective dose.</p><p>A clinical study to assess the effect of mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg (100 mcg total daily dose) on growth velocity has been conducted in pediatric patients 3 to 9 years of age with allergic rhinitis. No statistically significant effect on growth velocity was observed for mometasone furoate  nasal spray 50 mcg compared to placebo following one year of treatment. No evidence of clinically relevant HPA axis suppression was observed following a 30-minute cosyntropin infusion.</p><p>The potential of mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg to cause growth suppression in susceptible patients or when given at higher doses cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">A total of 280 patients above 64 years of age with allergic rhinitis or nasal polyps (age range 64 to 86 years) have been treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg for up to 3 or 4 months, respectively. The adverse reactions reported in this population were similar in type and incidence to those reported by younger patients.</p><h3>8.6 Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Concentrations of mometasone furoate appear to increase with severity of hepatic impairment [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There are no data available on the effects of acute or chronic overdosage with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg. Because of low systemic bioavailability, and an absence of acute drug-related systemic findings in clinical studies, overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation. Intranasal administration of 1600 mcg (4 times the recommended dose of mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age and older) daily for 29 days, to healthy human volunteers, showed no increased incidence of adverse events. Single intranasal doses up to 4000 mcg and oral inhalation doses up to 8000 mcg have been studied in human volunteers with no adverse effects reported. Chronic over dosage with any corticosteroid may result in signs or symptoms of hypercorticism [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>]. Acute overdosage with this dosage form is unlikely since one bottle of mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg contains approximately 8500 mcg of mometasone furoate.</p><h2>Mometasone Nasal Spray Description</h2><p class="First">Mometasone furoate anhydrous, USP, the active component of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid having the chemical name, 9,21-Dichloro-11ß,17-dihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17-(2-furoate), and the following chemical structure:</p><p>Mometasone furoate anhydrous, USP is a white to off-white powder, with an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">27</span>H<span class="Sub">30</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>, and a molecular weight of 521.43 g/mol. It is practically insoluble in water; slightly soluble in methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol; soluble in acetone and chloroform; and freely soluble in tetrahydrofuran. Its partition coefficient between octanol and water is greater than 5000.</p><p>Mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg is a metered-dose, manual pump spray unit containing an aqueous suspension of mometasone furoate, USP in an aqueous medium containing benzalkonium chloride, citric acid, glycerin, microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose sodium, polysorbate 80 and sodium citrate.  The pH is between 4.3 and 4.9.</p><h2>Mometasone Nasal Spray - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg is a corticosteroid demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory properties. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on allergic rhinitis is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation.</p><p>In two clinical studies utilizing nasal antigen challenge, mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg decreased some markers of the early- and late-phase allergic response. These observations included decreases (vs. placebo) in histamine and eosinophil cationic protein levels, and reductions (vs. baseline) in eosinophils, neutrophils, and epithelial cell adhesion proteins. The clinical significance of these findings is not known.</p><p>The effect of mometasone furoate  nasal spray, 50 mcg on nasal mucosa following 12 months of treatment was examined in 46 patients with allergic rhinitis. There was no evidence of atrophy and there was a marked reduction in intraepithelial eosinophilia and inflammatory cell infiltration (e.g., eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and plasma cells).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Adrenal Function in Adults: Four clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted in humans to assess the effect of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg at various doses on adrenal function. In one study, daily doses of 200 and 400 mcg of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg and 10 mg of prednisone were compared to placebo in 64 patients (22 to 44 years of age) with allergic rhinitis. Adrenal function before and after 36 consecutive days of treatment was assessed by measuring plasma cortisol levels following a 6-hour Cortrosyn (ACTH) infusion and by measuring 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, at both the 200- and 400-mcg dose, was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in mean plasma cortisol levels post-Cortrosyn infusion or a statistically significant decrease in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels compared to placebo. A statistically significant decrease in the mean plasma cortisol levels post-Cortrosyn infusion and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels was detected in the prednisone treatment group compared to placebo.</p><p>A second study assessed adrenal response to mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg (400 and 1600 mcg/day), prednisone (10 mg/day), and placebo, administered for 29 days in 48 male volunteers (21 to 40 years of age). The 24-hour plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span>), during and after an 8-hour Cortrosyn infusion and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels were determined at baseline and after 29 days of treatment. No statistically significant differences in adrenal function were observed with mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg compared to placebo.</p><p>A third study evaluated single, rising doses of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg (1000, 2000, and 4000 mcg/day), orally administered mometasone furoate (2000, 4000, and 8000 mcg/day), orally administered dexamethasone (200, 400, and 800 mcg/day), and placebo (administered at the end of each series of doses) in 24 male volunteers (22 to 39 years of age). Dose administrations were separated by at least 72 hours. Determination of serial plasma cortisol levels at 8 AM and for the 24-hour period following each treatment were used to calculate the plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span>). In addition, 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels were collected prior to initial treatment administration and during the period immediately following each dose. No statistically significant decreases in the plasma cortisol AUC, 8 AM cortisol levels, or 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels were observed in volunteers treated with either mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg or oral mometasone, as compared with placebo treatment. Conversely, nearly all volunteers treated with the three doses of dexamethasone demonstrated abnormal 8 AM cortisol levels (defined as a cortisol level &lt;10 mcg/dL), reduced 24-hour plasma AUC values, and decreased 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels, as compared to placebo treatment.</p><p>In a fourth study, adrenal function was assessed in 213 patients (18 to 81 years of age) with nasal polyps before and after 4 months of treatment with either mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, (200 mcg once or twice daily) or placebo by measuring 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, at both doses (200 and 400 mcg/day), was not associated with statistically significant decreases in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels compared to placebo.</p><p>Three clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted in pediatric patients to assess the effect of mometasone furoate nasal spray on the adrenal function at daily doses of 50, 100, and 200 mcg vs. placebo. In one study, adrenal function before and after 7 consecutive days of treatment was assessed in 48 pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis (ages 6 to 11 years) by measuring morning plasma cortisol and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Mometasone furoate nasal spray, at all three doses, was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in mean plasma cortisol levels or a statistically significant decrease in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels compared to placebo. In the second study, adrenal function before and after 14 consecutive days of treatment was assessed in 48 pediatric patients (ages 3 to 5 years) with allergic rhinitis by measuring plasma cortisol levels following a 30-minute Cortrosyn infusion. Mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, at all three doses (50, 100, and 200 mcg/day), was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in mean plasma cortisol levels post-Cortrosyn infusion compared to placebo. All patients had a normal response to Cortrosyn. In the third study, adrenal function before and after up to 42 consecutive days of once-daily treatment was assessed in 52 patients with allergic rhinitis (ages 2 to 5 years), 28 of whom received mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg per nostril (total daily dose 100 mcg), by measuring morning plasma cortisol and 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Mometasone furoate nasal spray was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in mean plasma cortisol levels or a statistically significant decrease in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels compared to placebo.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span></p><p>Mometasone furoate administered as a nasal spray suspension has very low bioavailability (&lt;1%) in plasma using a sensitive assay with a lower quantitation limit (LOQ) of 0.25 pcg/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span></p><p>The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> protein binding for mometasone furoate was reported to be 98% to 99% in concentration range of 5 to 500 ng/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span></p><p>Studies have shown that any portion of a mometasone furoate dose which is swallowed and absorbed undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites.

Of the total number of patients, there were 1757 males and 1453 females, including a total of 283 adolescents (182 boys and 101 girls) with seasonal allergic or perennial allergic rhinitis. Patients were treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg at doses ranging from 50 to 800 mcg/day. The majority of patients were treated with 200 mcg/day. The allergic rhinitis trials evaluated the total nasal symptom scores that included stuffiness, rhinorrhea, itching, and sneezing. Patients treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg, 200 mcg/day had a statistically significant decrease in total nasal symptom scores compared to placebo-treated patients. No additional benefit was observed for mometasone furoate doses greater than 200 mcg/day. A total of 350 patients have been treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg for 1 year or longer.</p><p>In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg, demonstrated improvement in nasal symptoms (vs. placebo) within 11 hours after the first dose based on one single-dose, parallel-group study of patients in an outdoor “park” setting (park study) and one environmental exposure unit (EEU) study, and within 2 days in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group seasonal allergic rhinitis studies. Maximum benefit is usually achieved within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of dosing.</p><p>Prophylaxis of seasonal allergic rhinitis for patients 12 years of age and older with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg, given at a dose of 200 mcg/day, was evaluated in two clinical studies in 284 patients. These studies were designed such that patients received 4 weeks of prophylaxis with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg prior to the anticipated onset of the pollen season; however, some patients received only 2 to 3 weeks of prophylaxis. Patients receiving 2 to 4 weeks of prophylaxis with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg demonstrated a statistically significantly smaller mean increase in total nasal symptom scores with onset of the pollen season as compared to placebo patients.</p><h3>14.2 Allergic Rhinitis in Pediatrics</h3><p class="First">The efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg in the treatment of seasonal allergic and perennial allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients (ages 3 to 11 years) have been evaluated in four controlled trials. This included approximately 990 pediatric patients ages 3 to 11 years (606 males and 384 females) with seasonal allergic or perennial allergic rhinitis treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray at doses ranging from 25 to 200 mcg/day. Pediatric patients treated with mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg (100 mcg total daily dose, 374 patients) had a significant decrease in total nasal symptom (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itching, and sneezing) scores, compared to placebo-treated patients. No additional benefit was observed for the 200-mcg mometasone furoate total daily dose in pediatric patients (ages 3 to 11 years). A total of 163 pediatric patients have been treated for 1 year.</p><h3>14.3 Nasal Polyps in Adults 18 Years of Age and Older</h3><p class="First">Two studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate nasal spray in the treatment of nasal polyps. These studies involved 664 patients with nasal polyps, 441 of whom received mometasone furoate nasal spray. These studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter studies in patients 18 to 86 years of age with bilateral nasal polyps. Patients were randomized to receive mometasone furoate nasal spray 200 mcg once daily, 200 mcg twice daily or placebo for a period of 4 months. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were 1) change from baseline in nasal congestion/obstruction averaged over the first month of treatment; and 2) change from baseline to last assessment in bilateral polyp grade during the entire 4 months of treatment as assessed by endoscopy. Efficacy was demonstrated in both studies at a dose of 200 mcg twice daily and in one study at a dose of 200 mcg once a day (see TABLE 2 below).</p><p><span class="Bold">TABLE 2: EFFECT OF MOMETASONE FUROATE NASAL SPRAY IN TWO RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIALS IN PATIENTS WITH NASAL POLYPS</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mometasone Furoate</span><span class="Bold">200</span></p><p><span class="Bold">mcg qd</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mometasone Furoate</span><span class="Bold">200 mcg bid</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">P</span> value for Mometasone Furoate 200 mcg qd vs. placebo</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">P</span> value for Mometasone Furoate 200 mcg bid vs. placebo</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 1</span></p><p class="First">N=115</p><p class="First">N=122</p><p class="First">N=117</p><p class="First">Baseline bilateral polyp grade<span class="Sup">‡</span></p><p class="First">4.21</p><p class="First">4.27</p><p class="First">4.25</p><p class="First">Mean change from baseline in bilateral polyps grade</p><p class="First">-1.15</p><p class="First">-0.96</p><p class="First">-0.50</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First">0.01</p><p class="First">Baseline nasal congestion<span class="Sup">§</span></p><p class="First">2.29</p><p class="First">2.35</p><p class="First">2.28</p><p class="First">Mean change from baseline in nasal congestion</p><p class="First">-0.47</p><p class="First">-0.61</p><p class="First">-0.24</p><p class="First">0.001</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 2</span></p><p class="First">N=102</p><p class="First">N=102</p><p class="First">N=106</p><p class="First">Baseline bilateral polyp grade<span class="Sup">‡</span></p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">4.10</p><p class="First">4.17</p><p class="First">Mean change from baseline in bilateral polyps grade</p><p class="First">-0.78</p><p class="First">-0.96</p><p class="First">-0.62</p><p class="First">0.33</p><p class="First">0.04</p><p class="First">Baseline nasal congestion<span class="Sup">§</span></p><p class="First">2.23</p><p class="First">2.20</p><p class="First">2.18</p><p class="First">Mean change from baseline in nasal congestion</p><p class="First">-0.42</p><p class="First">-0.66</p><p class="First">-0.23</p><p class="First">0.01</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p><span class="Sup">‡</span> polyps in each nasal fossa were graded by the investigator based on endoscopic visualization, using a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = no polyps; 1 = polyps in the middle meatus, not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate; 2 = polyps reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate but not the inferior border of the inferior turbinate; 3 = polyps reaching to or below the border of the inferior turbinate, or polyps medial to the middle turbinate (score reflects sum of left and right nasal fossa grades).</p><p><span class="Sup">§</span> nasal congestion/obstruction was scored daily by the patient using a 0 to 3 categorical scale where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms.</p><p>There were no clinically relevant differences in the effectiveness of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 50 mcg, in the studies evaluating treatment of nasal polyps across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.</p><h3>14.4 Nasal Congestion Associated with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>The efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate nasal spray 50 mcg for nasal congestion associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis were evaluated in three randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trials of 15 days duration. The three trials included a total of 1008 patients 12 years of age and older with nasal congestion associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, of whom 506 received mometasone furoate nasal spray 200 mcg daily and 502 received placebo. Of the 1008 patients, the majority 784 (78 %) were Caucasians. The majority of the patients were between 18 to &lt; 65 years of age with a mean age of 38.8 years and were predominantly women (66%). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in average morning and evening reflective nasal congestion score over treatment day 1 to day 15. The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in average morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (TNSS = rhinorrhea [nasal discharge/runny nose or postnasal drip], nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, sneezing) averaged over treatment day 1 to 15. Two out of three studies demonstrated that treatment with mometasone furoate nasal spray significantly reduced the nasal congestion symptom score and the TNSS compared to placebo in patients 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis (see TABLE 3 and 4 below).</p><p><span class="Bold">TABLE 3: EFFECT OF MOMETASONE FUROATE NASAL SPRAY IN TWO RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIALS ON NASAL CONGESTION IN PATIENTS WITH SEASONAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment (Patient Number)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Baseline <span class="Sup">§</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">LS Mean *</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Change from Baseline LS Mean *</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Difference from Placebo LS Mean *</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">P value for Mometasone Furoate 200 mcg qd vs. placebo</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 1</span></p><p class="First">Mometasone furoate 200 mcg qd (N=176)</p><p class="First">2.63</p><p class="First">-0.64</p><p class="First">-0.15</p><p class="First">0.006</p><p class="First">Placebo (N=175)</p><p class="First">2.62</p><p class="First">-0.49</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 2</span></p><p class="First">Mometasone furoate 200 mcg qd (N=168)</p><p class="First">2.62</p><p class="First">-0.71</p><p class="First">-0.31</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First">Placebo (N=164)</p><p class="First">2.60</p><p class="First">-0.40</p><p><span class="Sup">§</span> nasal congestion/obstruction was scored daily by the patient using a 0 to 3 categorical scale where 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms and 3 = severe symptoms.</p><p><span class="Sup">*</span> LS Mean and p- value was from an ANCOVA model with treatment, baseline value, and center effects.</p><p><span class="Bold">TABLE 4: EFFECT OF MOMETASONE FUROATE</span><span class="Bold"> NASAL SPRAY ON TNSS IN TWO RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIALS IN PATIENTS WITH SEASONAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment (Patient Number)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Baseline <span class="Sup">§</span> LS Mean *</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Change from Baseline LS Mean *</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Difference from Placebo LS Mean *</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">P value for Mometasone Furoate 200 mcg qd vs. placebo</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 1</span></p><p class="First">Mometasone furoate 200 mcg qd (N=176)</p><p class="First">9.60</p><p class="First">-2.68</p><p class="First">-0.83</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First">Placebo (N=175)</p><p class="First">9.66</p><p class="First">-1.85</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 2</span></p><p class="First">Mometasone furoate 200 mcg qd (N=168)</p><p class="First">9.39</p><p class="First">-3</p><p class="First">-1.27</p><p class="First">&lt;0.001</p><p class="First">Placebo (N=164)</p><p class="First">9.50</p><p class="First">-1.73</p><p><span class="Sup">§</span> TNSS was the sum of four individual symptom scores: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching and sneezing.
