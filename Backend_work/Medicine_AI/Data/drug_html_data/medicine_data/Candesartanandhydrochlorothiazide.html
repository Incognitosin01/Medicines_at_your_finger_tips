</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonist/Thiazide Combination</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonist</p><p>Chemical Class: Thiazide</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p>Candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of stroke and heart attack.</p><p>Candesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking the action of a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. As a result, candesartan relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p><p>Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure.</p><p>Candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide</h2><p><i>Candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide should not be the first medicine you use to treat your condition</i>.

You may need to stop using candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur after the first dose, especially if you have been taking a diuretic (water pill). <i>Make sure you know how you react to candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you dizzy or not alert</i>. If you feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint. Then sit for a few moments before standing to prevent the dizziness from returning.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you experience confusion, dizziness, muscle pain, weakness, or a fast heartbeat. Drink more fluids when you exercise or if the weather is hot. Heavy sweating or diarrhea and vomiting can cause dehydration (loss of too much water) or electrolyte imbalances (loss of sodium in the body). Check with your doctor if you become sick with severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.</p><p>Check with your doctor immediately if blurred vision, difficulty in reading, eye pain, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment.

Diabetic patients may notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Hyperkalemia (high potassium in the blood) may occur while you are using candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Check with your doctor right away if you have stomach pain, confusion, irregular heartbeat, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or lips, trouble breathing, or weakness or heaviness of the legs. <i>Do not use medicines, supplements, or salt substitutes containing potassium without first checking with your doctor</i>.</p><p>Candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, non-melanoma skin cancer). Avoid sun exposure. Use a sunscreen when you are outdoors. Avoid sunlamps and tanning beds. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes prescription or over-the-counter (nonprescription) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, and herbal or vitamin supplements, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
