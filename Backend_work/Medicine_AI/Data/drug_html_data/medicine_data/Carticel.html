</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Carticel</h2><p>Autologous cultured chondrocytes are used, as part of an overall program (that includes knee surgery and special exercises), to help repair damaged knee cartilage caused by acute or repetitive trauma in patients who had not responded to a prior arthroscopic or other surgical repair procedure. Cartilage is a type of tissue that joins together and helps support parts of the body. Autologous cultured chondrocytes are the patient's own cartilage cells. The cells are removed from the patient and sent to a laboratory, where they are processed to increase their number. The cells are then implanted (placed) in the damaged part of the knee. After implantation, the chondrocytes help form new, healthy cartilage.</p><p>This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a trained doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Carticel</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Carticel</h2><p>This medicine is to be given only by a doctor who have completed Vericel's Surgeon Training Program. Carticel® will be injected into your knee joint with a needle during surgery.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Carticel</h2><p><i>Your doctor will check your progress closely while you are receiving this medicine</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it and to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Use crutches to help you walk for the first 6 to 8 weeks after receiving the implant.</p><p>After the implant surgery, your doctor will direct you to start a rehabilitation program that includes exercise. This program is a very important part of your treatment. You will be instructed to start out slowly and to increase gradually the number of times that you do each exercise. <i>To get the most help from this program, it is very important that you follow the instructions as closely as possible. Do not do different exercises, and do not increase the number of times you do each exercise faster than directed</i>. If pain or swelling occurs when you increase the amount of exercise you are doing, go back to the last level of exercise until the pain and swelling are gone, then try again. Use ice packs to help reduce the swelling.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if sharp pain occurs in the knee that received the implant, or if “locking” of the knee occurs.</p><p>Autologous cultured chondrocytes are the patient's own cartilage cells. Patients undergoing surgical procedures using Carticel® are not routinely tested for transmissible infectious diseases and may increase risk to have them. Talk with your doctor about this risk if you are concerned.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Carticel side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
