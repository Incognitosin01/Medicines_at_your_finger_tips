The risk of nephrotoxicity is greater in patients with impaired renal function, the elderly, and in those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications. Assess creatinine clearance in all patients prior to initiating therapy and daily during therapy. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended for complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) patients with CrCl less than 90 mL/min to avoid potentially toxic levels.Ototoxicity, manifested as hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vertigo, has been reported with plazomicin. Symptoms of aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity may be irreversible and may not become evident until after completion of therapy. Aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity has been observed primarily in patients with a family history of hearing loss, patients with renal impairment, and in patients receiving higher doses and/or longer durations of therapy than recommended.Aminoglycosides have been associated with neuromuscular blockade. During therapy with plazomicin, monitor for adverse reactions associated with neuromuscular blockade, particularly in high-risk patients, such as patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders (including myasthenia gravis) or in patients concomitantly receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.Aminoglycosides, including plazomicin, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth.</p><p>Plazomicin may be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using plazomicin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For plazomicin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to plazomicin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of plazomicin in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of plazomicin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution for patients receiving plazomicin.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of plazomicin.

These could be symptoms of a serious kidney problem.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have a sudden decrease in hearing or loss of hearing, ringing in the ears, dizziness or lightheadedness, a feeling of constant movement of self or surroundings, or a sensation of spinning. These may be symptoms of a serious hearing or balance problem.</p><p>Receiving plazomicin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Plazomicin may cause a serious allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after receiving plazomicin.</p><p>Plazomicin may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. It may occur 2 months or more after you stop receiving plazomicin. Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor.
