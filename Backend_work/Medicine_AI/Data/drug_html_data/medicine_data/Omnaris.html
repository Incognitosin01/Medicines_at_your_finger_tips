Omnaris is also used to treat nasal symptoms caused by year-round allergies in adults and children who are at least 12 years old.</p><p>Omnaris may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before using Omnaris, tell your doctor if you have asthma, glaucoma, tuberculosis or other infection of the lungs, an open sore inside your nose, or a recent nose injury or surgery. Tell your doctor if you are or have been using any other steroid medications: oral, inhaled, or injected.</p><p>Omnaris comes with patient instructions for safe and effective use. Follow these directions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>It may take 1 to 2 days before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medication as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 2 to 5 weeks of treatment.</p><p>If you stopped using another steroid medication when you started using Omnaris, you may have steroid withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include joint or muscle pain, depression, and weakness. Do not stop using any steroid medication without first talking to your doctor. You may need to use less and less before you stop the medication completely.</p><p>Although it is not likely that your body will absorb enough ciclesonide, when receiving doses of Omnaris nasal spray, to cause serious side effects, tell your doctor if you have any steroid-related symptoms such as irregular menstrual periods, acne, increased hair growth, swelling, rapid weight gain, roundness of the face, increased sweating, depression, anxiety, or unusual thoughts or behavior.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have sores or white patches inside or around your nostrils, or if you have any vision problems, such as tunnel vision.</p><p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Call your doctor for preventive treatment if you are exposed to chickenpox or measles. These conditions can be serious or even fatal in people who are using steroid medication.</p><h2>Before using this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Omnaris if you are allergic to ciclesonide.</p><p>To make sure Omnaris is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
