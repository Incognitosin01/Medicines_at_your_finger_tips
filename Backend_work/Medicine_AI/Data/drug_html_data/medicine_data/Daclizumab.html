If a patient develops a serious immune-mediated disorder, consider stopping daclizumab and refer the patient to a specialist to ensure comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.</p><p>Some patients required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant treatment for autoimmune hepatitis or other immune-mediated disorders and continued this treatment after the last dose of daclizumab.</p><p>Because of the risks of hepatic injury, including autoimmune hepatitis, and other immune-mediated disorders, daclizumab is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ZINBRYTA REMS Program.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Daclizumab may cause severe hepatic injury, including hepatic failure and autoimmune hepatitis; fatal cases have occurred. Hepatotoxicity, including autoimmune hepatitis, may occur at any time during daclizumab treatment; cases have been reported up to 5</b><b> months after the last dose. Daclizumab is contraindicated in patients with preexisting hepatic disease or hepatic impairment. Obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels prior to treatment initiation, monthly before each dose, and monthly for 6 months after the last daclizumab dose. If transaminases or total bilirubin are elevated, treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required. Some patients required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant treatment for autoimmune hepatitis and continued this treatment after the last daclizumab dose.</b> ALT or AST elevations (including rare elevations &gt;20 times ULN) and bilirubin elevations have occurred during treatment and up to 4 months following the last dose. Monitor for clinical signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, jaundice, and/or dark urine); if reported, promptly obtain serum transaminases and total bilirubin; may require treatment interruption or discontinuation. Prolonged transaminase elevations should be evaluated for alternate causes, including infection. If autoimmune hepatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue daclizumab; may require systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressant therapy. Long-term immunosuppression may be necessary. Other medications (including OTC medications, herbals, and dietary supplements) associated with hepatotoxicity should be used with caution in combination with daclizumab.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria may occur after the first dose or at any time during treatment. If anaphylaxis or other allergic reaction occurs, discontinue daclizumab and do not re-initiate.</p><p>• Immune-mediated disorders: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: In addition to autoimmune hepatitis, other immune-mediated disorders such as skin reactions, lymphadenopathy, noninfectious colitis, and other serious conditions may occur with daclizumab. Serious immune-mediated conditions were observed in 5% of patients treated with daclizumab. If a serious immune-mediated disorder develops, consider stopping daclizumab and refer to a specialist for a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and appropriate management. Some patients required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant treatment for immune-mediated disorders and continued this treatment after the last daclizumab dose.</b> Concurrent or sequential immune-mediated disorders have been reported in some cases. Immune-mediated disorders have resulted in invasive diagnostic procedures, hospitalization, and/or prolonged systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant therapy; some events had not resolved following daclizumab discontinuation and follow-up. Immune-mediated disorders have involved a single organ or systemic multi-organ inflammatory reactions. Monitor closely for immune-mediated disorders. Suspected immune-mediated disorders should be adequately evaluated to confirm etiology or to exclude other causes. Some immune-mediated disorders have required several months for resolution after the last dose and some had not resolved even several months after discontinuation.</p><p>- Colitis: Immune-mediated colitis, including colitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, proctitis, and proctocolitis, has occurred. If symptoms of colitis (abdominal pain, fever, prolonged diarrhea) occur, consider discontinuing therapy and referring to a gastroenterologist.</p><p>- Dermatologic toxicity: Immune-mediated skin reactions, including rash, dermatitis, eczema, psoriatic conditions, and drug eruptions have occurred with daclizumab; erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, and exfoliative rash have also been reported. Skin reactions may occur at any time during therapy. Photosensitivity has also been reported. Daclizumab may exacerbate eczema or psoriasis in patients with a history of those conditions. Dermatologic toxicity may be managed with topical or systemic corticosteroids, or immunosuppressant therapy (eg, tacrolimus). Some skin reactions have required discontinuation. Rash typically resolved at ~3 months, although some rashes remained unresolved at the final clinical evaluation. Infectious complications due to serious cutaneous reaction has been reported, including a rare fatality. Serious diffuse or inflammatory rashes should be evaluated by a dermatologist prior to the next dose; discontinuation may be appropriate.</p><p>- Hemolytic anemia: Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia has occurred; typically resolves with discontinuation of treatment, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressant treatment, and blood transfusions. If signs/symptoms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia occur, consider discontinuing treatment and referring to appropriate specialist for further evaluation and management.</p><p>- Lymphadenopathy: An increased incidence of lymphadenopathy was reported in patients who received daclizumab. The onset of lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis may occur throughout the daclizumab treatment period. Serious events related to lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis included infections, salivary neoplasm (benign), skin reactions, thrombocytopenia, and interstitial lung changes. Most cases resolved within 3 months, either with treatment continuing or discontinued. If lymph node biopsy is considered, the patient should undergo a full diagnostic exam by a specialist.</p><p>- Oral ulcers: Immune-mediated oral ulcers have been reported.</p><p>• Infection: Daclizumab increases the risk for infections (some serious). Upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and viral infections were the most common infections; cytomegalovirus infections (hepatitis and pneumonia) have also occurred. In countries where tuberculosis is endemic, cases of tuberculosis occurred in patients receiving daclizumab. Evaluate patients at high risk for tuberculosis infection prior to treatment initiation. Avoid initiating daclizumab in patients with tuberculosis or other severe active infection. If serious infection develops while on therapy, consider withholding daclizumab until infection resolves. Screen for hepatitis B and C prior to treatment initiation.</p><p>• Neuropsychiatric events: Depression-related events occurred more frequently in patients receiving daclizumab than in patients who received placebo or comparator drug. Some events were serious, including suicidal ideation or attempt. Use daclizumab with caution in patients with prior or current depressive disorders. Patients or caregivers should immediately report symptoms of new or worsening depression or suicidal ideation. Consider discontinuing daclizumab if severe depression or suicidal ideation develops.</p><p><b><i>Disease related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Patients with signs/symptoms of hepatic impairment may be at increased risk for hepatotoxicity. Use is contraindicated in patients with preexisting hepatic disease, hepatic impairment, or history of autoimmune hepatitis (or other autoimmune condition involving the liver).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002, Lucente 2000, Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986, CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Immunizations: Immunization with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and for up to 4 months after discontinuation. Consider necessary immunization prior to initiation of daclizumab treatment.</p><p>• Immunogenicity: Anti-daclizumab antibodies and neutralizing antibodies may develop, usually during the first year of treatment, with the frequency declining with continued treatment. Anti-daclizumab antibodies were transient in some patients and persistent in others.</p><p>• REMS program: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Due to the risks of hepatotoxicity (including autoimmune hepatitis) and other immune-mediated disorders, daclizumab is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ZINBRYTA REMS Program.</b> Prescribers and pharmacies must be certified with the program and patients must be enrolled in the program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. Further information is available at 1-800-456-2255.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>ALT, AST, and total bilirubin (prior to treatment, then monthly during treatment [prior to the next dose] and for 6 months after the last dose).  Screen patients for hepatitis B and C (prior to treatment initiation). Evaluate for tuberculosis (in patients at high risk) prior to treatment. Evaluate immunization status prior to treatment. Monitor for signs/symptoms of colitis, depression, dermatologic toxicity, hepatic dysfunction, hypersensitivity, immune-mediated disorders, and infection.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>In general, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis are stopped prior to a planned pregnancy except in females at high risk of multiple sclerosis activity (AAN [Rae-Grant 2018]). Consider use of agents other than daclizumab for females at high risk of disease reactivation who are planning a pregnancy. Delaying pregnancy is recommended for females with persistent high disease activity; when disease-modifying therapy is needed in these patients, other agents are preferred (ECTRIMS/EAN [Montalban 2018]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Information related to the use of daclizumab in pregnancy is limited (Gold 2016).</p><p>In general, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis are not initiated during pregnancy, except in females at high risk of multiple sclerosis activity (AAN [Rae-Grant 2018]).
