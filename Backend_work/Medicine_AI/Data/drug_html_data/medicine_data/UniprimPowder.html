</ul><h2>Uniprim Powder Description</h2><p class="First">Uniprim Powder contains 67 mg trimethoprim and 333 mg sulfadiazine per gram.<br/>
<br/>
UNIPRIM POWDER is a combination of trimethoprim and sulfadiazine in the ratio of 1 part to 5 parts by weight, which provides effective antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacterial infections in animals.<br/>
<br/>
Trimethoprim is 2,4 diamino-5-(3, 4, 5-trimethoxybenzyl) pyrimidine.</p><p></p><h2>ACTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Microbiology:</span>  Trimethoprim blocks bacterial production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.<br/>
<br/>
Sulfadiazine, in common with other sulfonamides, inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with <span class="Italics">para</span>-aminobenzoic acid.<br/>
<br/>
Trimethoprim/sulfadiazine thus imposes a sequential double blockade on bacterial metabolism.  This deprives bacteria of nucleic acids and proteins essential for survival and multiplication, and produces a high level of antibacterial activity which is usually bactericidal.<br/>
<br/>
Although both sulfadiazine and trimethoprim are antifolate, neither affects the folate metabolism of animals.  The reasons are: animals do not synthesize folic acid and cannot, therefore, be directly affected by sulfadiazine; and although animals must reduce their dietary folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, trimethoprim does not affect this reduction because its affinity for dihydrofolate reductase of mammals is significantly less than for the corresponding bacterial enzyme.<br/>
<br/>
Trimethoprim/sulfadiazine is active against a wide spectrum of bacterial pathogens, both gram-negative and gram-positive.  The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.  In general, species of the following genera are sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfadiazine:<br/></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Uniprim Powder</h2><p class="First">Trimethoprim/sulfadiazine is indicated in horses where potent systemic antibacterial action against sensitive organisms is required.  Trimethoprim/sulfadiazine is indicated where control of bacterial infections is required during treatment of:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Trimethoprim/sulfadiazine should not be used in horses showing marked liver parenchymal damage, blood dyscrasias, or in those with history of sulfonamide sensitivity.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Do not use in horses intended for human consumption.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No adverse reactions of consequence have been noted following administration of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine.  During clinical trials, one case of anorexia and one case of loose feces following treatment with the drug were reported.<br/>
<br/>
Individual animal hypersensitivity may result in local or generalized reactions, sometimes fatal.  Anaphylactoid reactions, although rare, may also occur.  <span class="Bold">Antidote:</span>  Epinephrine.</p><h2>PRECAUTION</h2><p class="First">Water should be readily available to horses receiving sulfonamide therapy. </p><h2>TOXICITY AND SIDE EFFECTS</h2><p class="First">Toxicity is low.  The acute toxicity of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine is more than 5 g/kg orally in rats and mice.  No significant changes were recorded in rats given doses of 600 mg/kg per day for 90 days.<br/>
<br/>
Horses treated intravenously with trimethoprim/sulfadiazine 48% injection have tolerated up to five times the recommended daily dose for 21 consecutive days without clinical effects or histopathological changes.<br/>
<br/>
Lengthening of clotting time was seen in some of the horses on high or prolonged dosing in one of two trials.  The effect, which may have been related to a resolving infection, was not seen in a second similar trial.<br/>
<br/>
Slight to moderate reductions in hematopoietic activity following high, prolonged dosage in several species have been recorded.  This is usually reversible by folinic acid (leucovorin) administration or by stopping the drug.  During long-term treatment of horses, periodic platelet counts and white and red blood cell counts are advisable.</p><h2>TERATOLOGY</h2><p class="First">The effect of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine on pregnancy has not been determined.  Studies to date show there is no detrimental effect on stallion spermatogenesis with or following the recommended dose of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine.</p><h2>Uniprim Powder Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended dose is 3.75 g trimethoprim/sulfadiazine per 110 lbs (50 kg) body weight per day.  Administer trimethoprim/sulfadiazine Powder orally once a day in a small amount of palatable feed.<br/>
<br/>
The usual course of treatment is a single, daily dose for five to seven days.<br/>
<br/>
Continue acute infection therapy for two or three days after clinical signs have subsided.<br/>
<br/>
If no improvement of acute infections is seen in three to five days, re-evaluate diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
Trimethoprim/sulfadiazine may be used alone or in conjunction with intravenous dosing.  Following treatment with trimethoprim/sulfadiazine 48% injection, therapy can be maintained using oral powder.<br/>
<br/>
A complete blood count should be done periodically in patients receiving trimethoprim/sulfadiazine for prolonged periods.  If significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, treatment with trimethoprim/sulfadiazine should be discontinued.<br/></p><h2>How is Uniprim Powder Supplied</h2><p class="First">Uniprim Powder is available in 37.5 g packets, 1125 g packets, 200g jars, 400g jars, 1200 g jars, 2000 g pails and 12 kg boxes.</p><h2>CAUTION</h2><p class="First">Federal (U.S.A.) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ANADA</span> # 200-033, approved by FDA</p><p></p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL - 400 g jar (Apple Flavored)</h2><p class="First">MACLEOD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.<br/>
