</ul><p class="First">Booster Vaccination</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>A single dose of MenQuadfi may be administered to individuals 15 years of age and older who are at continued risk for meningococcal disease if at least 4 years have elapsed since a prior dose of meningococcal (Groups A, C, W, Y) conjugate vaccine.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">MenQuadfi is a sterile solution for intramuscular injection supplied in 0.5 mL single-dose vials.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, or after a previous dose of MenQuadfi or any other tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine [<span class="Italics">see Description (11)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Management of Acute Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Appropriate observation and medical treatment should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.</p><h3>Altered Immunocompetence</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reduced Immune Response</span></p><p>Some individuals with altered immunocompetence, including some individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have reduced immune responses to MenQuadfi.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Complement Deficiency</span></p><p>Persons with certain complement deficiencies and persons receiving treatment that inhibits terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by <span class="Italics">N</span>. <span class="Italics">meningitidis</span>, including invasive disease caused by serogroups A, C, W, and Y, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination with MenQuadfi [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)</span>].</p><h3>Syncope</h3><p class="First">Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, vaccination with MenQuadfi.</p><p>Procedures should be in place to prevent falling and injury and to manage syncope.</p><h3>Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been reported in temporal relationship following administration of another U.S.-licensed meningococcal quadrivalent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. The decision by the healthcare professional to administer MenQuadfi to persons with a history of GBS should take into account the expected benefits and potential risks.</p><h3>Tetanus Immunization</h3><p class="First">Immunization with MenQuadfi does not substitute for routine tetanus immunization.</p><h3>Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness</h3><p class="First">Vaccination with MenQuadfi may not protect all vaccine recipients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial(s) of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial(s) of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of a single dose of MenQuadfi in individuals 2 years of age and older was evaluated in five randomized, active-controlled, multi-center clinical studies conducted in the US and Puerto Rico. In these studies, a total of 4,919 participants received either a primary dose (N = 4517) or a booster dose (N = 402) of MenQuadfi and were included in the safety analyses.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Safety Monitoring</span></p><p>Participants were monitored for immediate reactions for 30 minutes following vaccination while at the study site. Solicited injection site and systemic reactions were recorded by participants or by parents/guardians in a diary card at home daily for 7 days following vaccination. All unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 30 days following vaccination were recorded by participants or by parents/guardians and collected by the study site at the next visit. Unsolicited adverse events that were medically attended (i.e., visits to an emergency room, or an unexpected visit to a health care provider), and all serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected for at least 6 months after vaccination.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary Vaccination Studies</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Children 2 through 9 years of age</span></p><p>The safety of MenQuadfi in children 2 years through 9 years of age was evaluated in Study 1 (NCT03077438).

No SAEs were determined to be vaccine related.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Booster Vaccination Study</span></p><p>The safety of MenQuadfi in previously vaccinated adolescents and adults 15 years of age and older was evaluated in Study 5 (NCT02752906). All randomized participants had received a primary dose of either (Menveo or Menactra) 4 to 10 years previously. The safety analysis set included 402 participants who received a single booster dose of MenQuadfi (median age: 17.8 years) and 407 participants who received a single booster dose of Menactra (median age: 17.9 years). Of the participants who received MenQuadfi, 51.5% were female, 85.1% were White, 9.7% were Black, 2.7 % were Asian and 2.2 % were of other racial groups, and 15.7% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.</p><p>The most commonly reported solicited adverse reactions (≥10%) within 7 days of MenQuadfi booster vaccination were injection site pain (44.7%) and headache (37.9%), myalgia (36.7%), and malaise (27.6%). The majority of solicited adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved within 3 days. Compared with recipients of a Menactra booster dose, recipients of a MenQuadfi booster dose had higher rates of injection site erythema (MenQuadfi 5.0%, Menactra 1.5%) and swelling (MenQuadfi 4.0%, Menactra 0.7%). Overall rates of solicited adverse reactions were comparable to those observed in unvaccinated adolescents and adults after a single MenQuadfi dose.</p><p>SAEs occurred at a rate of 1.2% following MenQuadfi and at a rate of 1.0% following Menactra during the entire study period.

The polysaccharides are extracted from the <span class="Italics">N. meningitidis</span> cells and purified by centrifugation, detergent precipitation, alcohol precipitation, solvent extraction, and diafiltration. To prepare the polysaccharides for conjugation, Serogroup A is activated with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), derivatized with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH), and purified by diafiltration. Serogroups C, W, and Y are depolymerized, activated with periodate, and purified by diafiltration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium tetani</span> is fermented in media to generate tetanus toxin, which is purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation to yield purified tetanus toxin (PTT) and detoxified with formaldehyde to yield purified tetanus protein (PTP). The PTP is then concentrated and filtered to yield concentrated tetanus protein (CTP). The activated/derivatized polysaccharides are covalently linked to tetanus toxoid and purified by chromatography and serial diafiltration. The four meningococcal components, present as individual serogroup-specific glycoconjugates, compose the final formulated vaccine.</p><p>MenQuadfi is manufactured as a sterile, clear solution. Each 0.5 mL dose of vaccine contains 10 microgram each of meningococcal A, C, W, and Y polysaccharide antigens conjugated to approximately 55 micrograms tetanus toxoid protein carrier; 3.35 mg sodium chloride (0.67%), and 1.23 mg sodium acetate (30 mM). Potency of MenQuadfi is determined by quantifying the amount of each polysaccharide antigen that is conjugated to tetanus toxoid protein and the amount of unconjugated polysaccharide present.</p><p>No preservative or adjuvant is added during manufacture. Each 0.5 mL dose may contain residual amounts of formaldehyde of less than 3 mcg/mL, by calculation.</p><p>The vial in which the vaccine components are contained is composed of USP Type I borosilicate glass. The vial stopper is a chlorobutyl synthetic polyisoprene blend stopper (not made with natural rubber latex).</p><h2>MenQuadfi - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is caused by the bacterium <span class="Italics">N. meningitidis</span>, a gram-negative diplococcus found exclusively in humans. The presence of bactericidal anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies in serum has been associated with protection from IMD. MenQuadfi induces the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of <span class="Italics">N. meningitidis</span> serogroups A, C, W, and Y.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">MenQuadfi has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or for impairment of male fertility. MenQuadfi administered to female rabbits had no effects on fertility [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Population (8.1)</span>].</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">To infer effectiveness of MenQuadfi, the immunogenicity in persons 2 years of age and older was evaluated using a serogroup-specific serum bactericidal assay with exogenous human complement (hSBA). The hSBA responses following a single dose of MenQuadfi for primary vaccination were assessed in four studies, and the hSBA responses following a single dose of MenQuadfi for booster vaccination were assessed in one study. Serum was collected at baseline and 30 days post-vaccination to measure antibodies with hSBA. The hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) and proportion of participants who achieved hSBA seroresponse (defined below) were evaluated.</p><ul class="Disc">

The primary immunogenicity endpoint was hSBA seroresponse to each serogroup 30 days following booster vaccination with MenQuadfi or Menactra given to participants who received a prior dose of Menveo or Menactra 4 to 10 years ago. Seroresponse was defined as the proportion of participants with an hSBA pre-vaccination titer &lt; 1:8 who achieved a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:16, or pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:8 who achieved a post-vaccination titer at least 4-fold greater than the pre-vaccination titer.

These endpoints were also evaluated at 6 days post vaccination in a subset.</p><p>Seroresponse rates at Day 30 following booster vaccination with MenQuadfi were 92.2% for serogroup A, 97.1% for serogroup C, 98.2% for serogroup W, and 97.4% for serogroup Y, as compared to 87.1% for serogroup A, 91.8% for serogroup C, 90.7% for serogroup W, and 95.6% for serogroup Y, following booster vaccination with Menactra. At Day 6, following booster vaccination with MenQuadfi, seroresponse rates were 72.7%, 83.6%, 94.5%, and 90.9% for serogroups A, C, W, and Y, respectively.</p><p>The hSBA GMTs were 173, 334, 499, and 302 for serogroups A, C, W, and Y at Day 6, and 497, 2618, 1747, and 2070, respectively, for the 4 serogroups at Day 30 following booster dose of MenQuadfi.</p><p>Overall, similar seroresponse rates were observed for those participants who received booster vaccination with Menactra.</p><h3>Immunogenicity of Concomitantly Administered Vaccines</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of MenQuadfi with Tdap and HPV in adolescents 10 through 17 years was evaluated in Study 2 (NCT02199691). In this randomized study, 505 participants received MenQuadfi alone, 403 received MenQuadfi coadministered with Tdap and HPV, 300 received Tdap and HPV alone. A fourth group received Menveo alone (N=507).</p><p>No evidence of interference in hSBA seroresponse rates was observed when MenQuadfi was coadministered with Tdap and HPV. Antibody responses to HPV, and to the tetanus and diphtheria antigens were similar when Tdap and HPV were administered with and without MenQuadfi. Anti-pertussis GMC responses were non-inferior for the pertussis toxoid antigen, but did not meet non-inferiority for the FHA, PRN, and FIM antigens. The clinical relevance of the diminished responses to the pertussis antigens is unknown.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">MenQuadfi is supplied in a single-dose vial (NDC 49281-590-58), in packages of 5 vials (NDC 49281-590-05).</p><p>The vial stopper is not made with natural rubber latex.</p><p class="First">Store at 2°C to 8°C (35°F to 46°F).
