Tell your doctor if you are pregnant.</p><p><b>Anesthesia medicine may affect brain development in a child under 3, or an unborn baby whose mother receives  ketamine during late pregnancy.</b> These effects may be more likely when the anesthesia is used for 3 hours or longer, or used for repeated procedures. Effects on brain development could cause learning or behavior problems later in life.</p><p>Negative brain effects from anesthesia have been seen in animal studies. However, studies in human children receiving single short uses of anesthesia have not shown a likely effect on behavior or learning. More research is needed.</p><p>In some cases, your doctor may decide to postpone a surgery or procedure based on these risks. Treatment may not be delayed in the case of life-threatening conditions, medical emergencies, or surgery needed to correct certain birth defects.</p><p>Ask your doctor for information about all medicines that will be used during your surgery or procedure. Also ask how long the procedure will last.</p><p>It may not be safe to breast-feed shortly after receiving this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How is ketamine given?</h2><p>Ketamine is injected into a muscle, or as an infusion into a vein. You will receive this injection in a clinic or hospital setting.</p><p>Your breathing, blood pressure, heart function, and other vital signs will be watched closely while you are receiving ketamine.</p><p>You may feel strange or slightly confused when you first come out of anesthesia. Tell your caregivers if these feelings are severe or unpleasant.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since ketamine is usually given for anesthesia, you are not likely to be on a dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since ketamine is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur. Your vital signs will be closely watched while you are under anesthesia to make sure the medication is not causing any harmful effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving ketamine?</h2><p> ketamine may impair your thinking or reactions.
