The chemical name for Ketorolac tromethamine is (±)-5-Benzoyl-2,3-dihydro-1<span class="Italics">H</span>- pyrrolizine-1-carboxylic acid, compound with 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, and the structural formula is:</p><p><span class="Bold">C<span class="Sub">15</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span> • C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span></span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S and [+]R Ketorolac tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine may exist in three crystal forms. All forms are equally soluble in water. Ketorolac tromethamine has a pKa of 3.5 and an n-octanol/water partition coefficient of 0.26. The molecular weight of Ketorolac tromethamine is 376.41.</p><p>Each tablet for oral administration contains 10 mg Ketorolac tromethamine, USP. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, shellac glaze, isopropyl alcohol, black iron oxide, N-butyl alcohol, propylene glycol and ammonium hydroxide.</p><p>FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP.</p><h2>Ketorolac - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits analgesic activity in animal models. The mechanism of action of Ketorolac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase inhibition. The biological activity of Ketorolac tromethamine is associated with the S-form. Ketorolac tromethamine possesses no sedative or anxiolytic properties.</p><p>The peak analgesic effect of Ketorolac tromethamine occurs within 2 to 3 hours and is not statistically significantly different over the recommended dosage range of Ketorolac tromethamine. The greatest difference between large and small doses of Ketorolac tromethamine is in the duration of analgesia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is a racemic mixture of [-]S- and [+]R-enantiomeric forms, with the S-form having  analgesic activity.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Comparison of IV, IM and Oral Pharmacokinetics</span></span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of Ketorolac tromethamine, following IV, IM and oral doses of Ketorolac tromethamine tablets, are compared in Table 1. In adults, the extent of bioavailability following administration of the oral and IM forms of Ketorolac tromethamine was equal to that following an IV bolus.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Linear Kinetics</span></span></p><p>In adults, following administration of single oral, IM or IV doses of Ketorolac tromethamine in the recommended dosage ranges, the clearance of the racemate does not change. This implies that the pharmacokinetics of Ketorolac tromethamine in adults, following single or multiple IM, IV or recommended oral doses of Ketorolac tromethamine, are linear. At the higher recommended doses, there is a proportional increase in the concentrations of free and bound racemate.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is 100% absorbed after oral administration (see Table 1). Oral administration of Ketorolac tromethamine after a high-fat meal resulted in decreased peak and delayed time-to-peak concentrations of Ketorolac tromethamine by about one hour. Antacids did not affect the extent of absorption.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p>The mean apparent volume (V<span class="Sub">β</span>) of Ketorolac tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This parameter was determined from single-dose data. The Ketorolac tromethamine racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99%). Nevertheless, plasma concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will result in increased free drug concentrations.</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is excreted in human milk (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the urine.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></span></p><p>The principal route of elimination of Ketorolac and its metabolites is renal. About 92% of a given dose is found in the urine, approximately 40% as metabolites and 60% as unchanged Ketorolac.</p><p>Approximately 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces. A single-dose study with 10 mg Ketorolac tromethamine (n = 9) demonstrated that the S-enantiomer is cleared approximately 2 times faster than the R-enantiomer and that the clearance was independent of the route of administration. This means that the ratio of S/R plasma concentrations decreases with time after each dose. There is little or no inversion of the R- to S- form in humans. The clearance of the racemate in normal subjects, elderly individuals and in hepatically and renally impaired patients is outlined in Table 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Kinetics in Special Populations).</p><p>The half-life of the Ketorolac tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 2.5 hours (SD ± 0.4) compared with 5 hours (SD ± 1.7) for the R-enantiomer. In other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within the range of 5 to 6 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Accumulation</span></span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine administered as an IV bolus every 6 hours for 5 days to healthy subjects (n = 13), showed no significant difference in C<span class="Sub">max</span> on Day 1 and Day 5. Trough levels averaged 0.29 mcg/mL (SD ± 0.13) on Day 1 and 0.55 mcg/mL (SD ± 0.23) on Day 6. Steady-state was approached after the fourth dose.</p><p>Accumulation of Ketorolac tromethamine has not been studied in special populations (geriatric, pediatric, renal failure or hepatic disease patients).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Kinetics in Special Populations</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>Based on single-dose data only, the half-life of the Ketorolac tromethamine racemate increased from 5 to 7 hours in the elderly (65 to 78 years) compared with young healthy volunteers (24 to 35 years) (see Table 2). There was little difference in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> for the two groups (elderly, 2.52 mcg/mL ± 0.77; young, 2.99 mcg/mL ± 1.03) (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Limited information is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of dosing of Ketorolac tromethamine in the pediatric population. Following a single intravenous bolus dose of 0.5 mg/kg in 10 children 4 to 8 years old, the half-life was 5.8 ± 1.6 hours, the average clearance was 0.042 ± 0.01 L/hr/kg, the volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V<span class="Sub">β</span>) was 0.34 ± 0.12 L/kg and the volume of distribution at steady state (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) was 0.26 ± 0.08 L/kg. The volume of distribution and clearance of Ketorolac in pediatric patients was higher than those observed in adult subjects (see Table 1). There are no pharmacokinetic data available for administration of Ketorolac tromethamine by the IM route in pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Insufficiency</span></p><p>Based on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of Ketorolac tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours and is dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between creatinine clearance and total Ketorolac tromethamine clearance in the elderly and populations with renal impairment (r = 0.5).</p><p>In patients with renal disease, the AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span> of each enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of Ketorolac tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction.</p><p>The AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span>-ratio of the Ketorolac tromethamine enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy subjects (see WARNINGS: Renal Effects).</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></p><p>There was no significant difference in estimates of half-life, AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> in seven patients with liver disease compared to healthy volunteers (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Hepatic Effect and Table 2).</p><p><span class="Italics">Race</span></p><p>Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Parameters (units)</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oral <span class="Sup">*</span></span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intramuscular<span class="Sup">†</span></span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intravenous Bolus <span class="Sup">‡</span></span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">10 mg</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">15 mg</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">30 mg</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">60 mg</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">15 mg</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">30 mg</span><br/></p><p class="First">Bioavailability (extent)<br/></p><p class="First">100%<br/></p><p class="First">T<span class="Sub">max</span><span class="Sup">§</span> (min)<br/></p><p class="First">44 ± 34<br/></p><p class="First">33 ± 21<span class="Sup">¶</span><br/></p><p class="First">44 ± 29<br/></p><p class="First">33 ± 21<span class="Sup">¶</span><br/></p><p class="First">1.1 ± 0.7<span class="Sup">¶</span><br/></p><p class="First">2.9 ± 1.8<br/></p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span><span class="Sup">#</span>(mcg/mL) [single dose]<br/></p><p class="First">0.87 ±<br/>

(see Kinetics in Special Populations for use of IV dosing of Ketorolac tromethamine in pediatric patients).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span></p><p>In a postoperative study, where all patients received morphine by a PCA device, patients treated with Ketorolac tromethamine-IV as fixed intermittent boluses (e.g., 30 mg initial dose followed by 15 mg q3h), required significantly less morphine (26%) than the placebo group. Analgesia was significantly superior, at various postdosing pain assessment times, in the patients receiving Ketorolac tromethamine-IV plus PCA morphine as compared to patients receiving PCA-administered morphine alone.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>There is no data available to support the use of Ketorolac tromethamine tablets in pediatric patients.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ketorolac</h2><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Ketorolac tromethamine tablets, USP and other treatment options before deciding to use Ketorolac tromethamine tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acute Pain in Adult Patients</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are indicated for the short-term (≤ 5 days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Therapy should always be initiated with Ketorolac tromethamine-IV or IM and Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are to be used only as continuation treatment, if necessary.</p><p>The total combined duration of use of Ketorolac tromethamine-IV/IM and Ketorolac tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 days of use because of the potential of increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions associated with the recommended doses (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but Ketorolac tromethamine tablet therapy is not to exceed 5 days.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(see also BOXED WARNING)</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to Ketorolac tromethamine.</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine tablets should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Preexisting Asthma).</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are contraindicated as prophylactic analgesic before any major surgery.</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see WARNINGS).</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment or in patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion (see WARNINGS for correction of volume depletion).</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in labor and delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage.</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine inhibits platelet function and is, therefore, contraindicated in patients with suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis and those at high risk of bleeding (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients currently receiving aspirin or NSAIDs because of the cumulative risks of inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events.</p><p>The concomitant use of Ketorolac tromethamine and probenecid is contraindicated.  </p><p>The concomitant use of Ketorolac tromethamine and pentoxifylline is contraindicated.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(see also BOXED WARNING)</span></p><p>The total combined duration of use of Ketorolac tromethamine-IV/IM and Ketorolac tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients.</p><p>The most serious risks associated with Ketorolac tromethamine are:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with previously documented peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding. Ketorolac tromethamine can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration and perforation, of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with Ketorolac tromethamine.</p><p>Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Minor upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dyspepsia, are common and may also occur at any time during NSAID therapy. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal complications increases with increasing dose of, and duration of treatment with, Ketorolac tromethamine. Do not use Ketorolac tromethamine for more than 5 days. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. In addition to past history of ulcer disease, other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p><p><span class="Bold">To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.</span> Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of Ketorolac tromethamine until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</p><p>NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hemorrhage</span></p><p>Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and NSAIDs affect platelet aggregation as well, use of Ketorolac tromethamine in patients who have coagulation disorders should be undertaken very cautiously, and those patients should be carefully monitored. Patients on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g., heparin or dicumarol derivatives) have an increased risk of bleeding complications if given Ketorolac tromethamine concurrently; therefore, physicians should administer such concomitant therapy only extremely cautiously. The concurrent use of Ketorolac tromethamine and therapy that affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low-dose heparin (2500 to 5000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans have not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are available, physicians should carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only extremely cautiously. Patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis should be monitored closely.</p><p>In post-marketing experience, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with the perioperative use of IV or IM dosing of Ketorolac tromethamine. Therefore, perioperative use of Ketorolac tromethamine should be avoided and postoperative use be undertaken with caution when hemostasis is critical (see PRECAUTIONS).</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Effects</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose- dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, which, in patients with reduced creatinine clearance, will result in diminished clearance of the drug (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therefore, Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and such patients should be followed closely. With the use of Ketorolac tromethamine, there have been reports of acute renal failure, interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impaired Renal Function</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine concentrations indicating advanced renal impairment (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or a history of kidney disease because it is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Because patients with underlying renal insufficiency are at increased risk of developing acute renal decompensation or failure, the risks and benefits should be assessed prior to giving Ketorolac tromethamine to these patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Anaphylactoid Reactions</span></p><p>As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without a known previous exposure or hypersensitivity to Ketorolac tromethamine. Ketorolac tromethamine should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS: Preexisting Asthma). Anaphylactoid reactions, like anaphylaxis, may have a fatal outcome. Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Effects</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</span></span></p><p>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to  be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as Ketorolac tromethamine, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS).</p><p><span class="Italics">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p><p><span class="Italics">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all- cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next 4 years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of Ketorolac tromethamine in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Ketorolac tromethamine is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypertension</span></span></p><p>NSAIDs, including Ketorolac tromethamine, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including Ketorolac tromethamine, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Heart Failure and Edema</span></span></p><p>The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of Ketorolac tromethamine may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] (see Drug Interactions).</p><p>Avoid the use of Ketorolac tromethamine in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Ketorolac tromethamine is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin Reactions</span></p><p>NSAIDs, including Ketorolac tromethamine, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash, mucosal lesions or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)</span></p><p>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as Ketorolac tromethamine. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue Ketorolac tromethamine and evaluate the patient immediately.</p><p><span class="Bold">Fetal Toxicity</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:</span></p><p>Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Ketorolac tromethamine, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs including Ketorolac tromethamine, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.</p><p><span class="Bold">Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:</span></p><p>Use of NSAIDs, including Ketorolac tromethamine, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.</p><p>If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit Ketorolac tromethamine use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if Ketorolac tromethamine treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue Ketorolac tromethamine if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice (see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.</p><p>The pharmacological activity of Ketorolac tromethamine in reducing inflammation may diminish the utility of this diagnostic sign in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Effect</span></span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including Ketorolac tromethamine. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.</p><p>A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with Ketorolac tromethamine. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), Ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hematologic Effect</span></span></p><p>Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including Ketorolac tromethamine. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including Ketorolac tromethamine, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.</p><p>Patients receiving Ketorolac tromethamine who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</p><p><span class="Bold">Preexisting Asthma</span></p><p>Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal. Since cross-reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Ketorolac tromethamine should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is a potent NSAID and may cause serious side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney failure, which may result in hospitalization and even fatal outcome.</p><p>Physicians, when prescribing Ketorolac tromethamine, should inform their patients or their guardians of the potential risks of Ketorolac tromethamine treatment (see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), instruct patients to seek medical advice if  they develop treatment-related adverse events, and <span class="Bold">advise patients not to give Ketorolac tromethamine tablets to other family members and to discard any unused drug.</span></p><p>Remember that the total combined duration of use of Ketorolac tromethamine tablet and Ketorolac tromethamine IV or IM dosing is not to exceed 5 days in adults. Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients.</p><p>Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span></p><p>Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, Ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Ketorolac is highly bound to human plasma protein (mean 99.2%).

Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between Ketorolac tromethamine and warfarin or heparin, the administration of Ketorolac tromethamine to patients taking anticoagulants should be done extremely cautiously and patients should be closely monitored (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Hematologic Effect).</p><p>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs, in general, on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than the users of either drug alone.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Aspirin</span></span></p><p>When Ketorolac tromethamine is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free Ketorolac tromethamine is not altered.

Use of NSAIDs, including Ketorolac tromethamine, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of Ketorolac tromethamine use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid Ketorolac tromethamine use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity).</p><p><span class="Italics">Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</span><br/>

In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies performed during organogenesis using daily oral doses of Ketorolac tromethamine at 3.6 mg/kg (0.37 times the human AUC) in rabbits and at 10 mg/kg (1 times the human AUC) in rats, no evidence of teratogenicity to the fetus was revealed. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. Oral doses of Ketorolac tromethamine at 1.5 mg/kg (0.14 times the human AUC), administered after gestation day 17, caused dystocia and higher pup mortality in rats. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as Ketorolac tromethamine, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development.
