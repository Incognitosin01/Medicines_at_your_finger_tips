</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Loestrin 1.5/30</h2><p>Estrogens and progestins are female hormones. They are produced by the body and are necessary for the normal sexual development of the female and for the regulation of the menstrual cycle during the childbearing years.</p><p>The ovaries begin to produce less estrogen after menopause (the change of life). This medicine is prescribed to make up for the lower amount of estrogen. Estrogens help relieve signs of menopause, such as hot flashes and unusual sweating, chills, faintness, or dizziness. Progestins help to regulate the effects of estrogens.</p><p>Estrogens are prescribed for several reasons:</p><ul>
<li>to provide additional hormone when the body does not produce enough of its own, such as during menopause. They can also help to relieve a genital skin condition called vaginal or vulvar atrophy.</li>
<li>to help prevent weakening of bones (osteoporosis) in women past menopause.</li>
</ul><p>Estrogens may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>There is <i>no</i> medical evidence to support the belief that the use of estrogens will keep the patient feeling young, keep the skin soft, or delay the appearance of wrinkles. Nor has it been proven that the use of estrogens during menopause will relieve emotional and nervous symptoms, unless these symptoms are caused by other menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or hot flushes.</p><p>Estrogens and progestins are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Loestrin 1.5/30</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of estrogens and progestins in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Estrogens and progestins are not recommended for use during pregnancy or right after giving birth. Becoming pregnant or maintaining a pregnancy is not likely to occur around the time of menopause.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Estrogens and progestins pass into the breast milk and can change the content or lower the amount of breast milk. Use of this medicine is not recommended in nursing mothers.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with a medication in this class or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>

These visits will usually be every year, but some doctors require them more often.</p><p><i>It is not yet known whether the use of estrogens increases the risk of breast cancer in women</i>. <i>Therefore, it is very important that you regularly check your breasts for any unusual lumps or discharge. Report any problems to your doctor</i>. You should also have a mammogram (x-ray pictures of the breasts) done if your doctor recommends it. Because breast cancer has occurred in men taking estrogens, regular breast self-exams and exams by your doctor for any unusual lumps or discharge should be done.</p><p>Tell the doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine before having any laboratory test because some results may be affected.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Loestrin 1.5/30 side effects</h2><p>Women rarely have severe side effects from taking estrogens to replace estrogen. Discuss these possible effects with your doctor:</p><p>The prolonged use of estrogens has been reported to increase the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus) in women after menopause. This risk seems to increase as the dose and the length of use increase. When estrogens are used in low doses for less than 1 year, there is less risk. The risk is also reduced if a progestin (another female hormone) is added to, or replaces part of, your estrogen dose. If the uterus has been removed by surgery (total hysterectomy), there is no risk of endometrial cancer, and no need to take an estrogen and progestin combination.</p><p>It is not yet known whether the use of estrogens increases the risk of breast cancer in women. Although some large studies show an increased risk, most studies and information gathered to date do not support this idea.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor immediately</i> if any of the following side effects occur:</p><p>Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:</p><p><i>More common</i></p><ul>
