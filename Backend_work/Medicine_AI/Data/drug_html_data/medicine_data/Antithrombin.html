It is an alpha<sub>2</sub>-globulin. Its principal actions are the inactivation of thrombin, plasmin, and other active serine proteases of coagulation, including factors IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa. The inactivation of proteases is a major step in the normal clotting process. The strong activation of clotting enzymes at the site of every bleeding injury facilitates fibrin formation and maintains normal hemostasis. Thrombosis in the circulation would be caused by active serine proteases if they were not inhibited by antithrombin after the localized clotting process (Schwartz, 1989).</p><p>In patients with hereditary antithrombin (AT) deficiency, spontaneous thrombosis may occur due to decreased AT concentrations; therapy with human or recombinant AT restores functional AT activity. </p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Plasma derived (Thrombate III): Biologic: 2.5 days (immunologic assay); 3.8 days (functional AT assay). Half-life may be decreased following surgery, with hemorrhage, acute thrombosis, and/or during heparin administration.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Hereditary antithrombin deficiency:</b> Thrombate III: Treatment and prevention of thromboembolism and prevention of perioperative and peripartum thromboembolism in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Intraoperative heparin resistance during cardiopulmonary bypass</h3><p>Data from a limited number of patients suggest that antithrombin may be beneficial to improve heparinization during cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with difficulty achieving therapeutic activated clotting time values <sup>[Lemmer 2002]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Thrombate III: There are no contraindications listed in manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Hypersensitivity to antithrombin, other anticoagulants, or any component of the formulation.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Hereditary antithrombin deficiency:</b></p><p><b><i>Thrombate III:</i></b> Prophylaxis of thrombosis during surgical or obstetrical procedures or treatment of thromboembolism:</p><p>IV:</p><p>Initial loading dose: Dosing is individualized based on pretherapy antithrombin (AT) levels. The initial dose should raise AT levels to 120% and may be calculated based on the following formula:</p><p>[(desired AT level % - baseline AT level %) x body weight (kg)] <b>divided</b> by 1.4 = units of antithrombin required</p><p>For example, if a 70 kg adult patient had a baseline AT level of 57%, the initial dose would be:</p><p>[(120% - 57%) x 70] divided by 1.4 = 3150 units</p><p>Maintenance dose: In general, subsequent dosing should be targeted to keep levels between 80% to 120%, which may be achieved by administering 60% of the initial loading dose every 24 hours. Adjustments may be made by adjusting dose or interval. Maintain level within normal range for 2 to 8 days depending on type of procedure/situation.</p><p><b>Intraoperative heparin resistance during cardiopulmonary bypass (off-label use):</b></p><p><b><i>Thrombate III: </i></b>IV: Initial: 500 units once (dose can be rounded to the nearest vial size); a repeat dose of 500 units may be considered if activated clotting time remains subtherapeutic after the initial dose (Lemmer 2002).</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

If hypersensitivity symptoms occur, discontinue immediately and institute supportive emergency care.</p><p>• Infections: Thrombate III: Thrombate III is AT collected from pooled human plasma (hpAT). A product of human plasma, it may potentially contain infectious agents which could transmit disease, including the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) agent; screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces this risk. Infections suspected to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Pharmacokinetic differences: Half-life and clearance differ significantly (~7 to 9 times) between the plasma-derived and the recombinant-derived product.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p><b>Hereditary antithrombin deficiency:</b></p><p>Thrombate III: Initially, monitor antithrombin (AT) at baseline, 20 minutes postinfusion (peak), 12 hours postinfusion, then preceding next infusion (trough level). Measure peak and trough AT levels with each subsequent dose until predictable levels achieved (between 80% and 120%). Some situations (eg, following surgery, hemorrhage or acute thrombosis, concurrent IV heparin administration), may require more frequent AT monitoring.</p><p>AT concentrations in neonates of parents with hereditary AT deficiency should be measured immediately after birth.</p><p><b>Intraoperative heparin resistance during cardiopulmonary bypass (off-label use):</b></p><p>Due to laboratory turn-around times, routine monitoring of AT levels before or after Thrombate III administration is not feasible in the intraoperative setting. Therefore, therapeutic response should be monitored with activated clotting time (Lemmer 2002).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>The risk of thromboembolic events such as venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased in patients with hereditary antithrombin (AT) deficiency. Pregnancy-induced physiologic changes also increase this risk; risk is dependent upon maternal antithrombin levels and personal or family history of thromboembolism (ACOG 197 2018). Thrombate III is approved for use in pregnant women with hereditary AT deficiency to replace endogenous antithrombin and reduce the risk of peripartum thromboembolism. Antithrombin replacement can be used in pregnant patients with hereditary AT deficiency in high-risk settings (eg, childbirth, miscarriage, surgery) when other anticoagulant therapy (eg, low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) is withheld or as adjunctive therapy to LMWH in pregnant women at high risk for VTE (Bauer 2016; Ilonczai 2015; James 2017; Rogenhofer 2014).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat antithrombin deficiency.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
