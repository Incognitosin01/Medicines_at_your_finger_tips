To reduce the potential for fatal medication errors due to incorrect route of administration proper dilution, product labeling and packaging is necessary. Intravenous needle or catheter must be properly positioned before any vinCRIStine is injected, as leakage into the surrounding tissue may cause considerable irritation. If extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued immediately, and any remaining portion of the dose should then be introduced into another vein. Local injection of hyaluronidase and the application of moderate heat to the area of leakage help disperse the drug and are thought to minimize discomfort and the possibility of cellulitis.</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It may not be specific to Vincasar PFS. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Vincristine is often given together with certain other medicines. If you are using a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your health care professional to help you plan a way to take them at the right times.</p><p>While you are using this medicine, it may be necessary to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine. This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well. Ask your doctor if this is necessary for you.</p><p>This medicine sometimes causes nausea and vomiting. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your health care professional for ways to lessen these effects.</p><p>Vincristine frequently causes constipation and stomach cramps. Your doctor may want you to take a laxative. However, do not decide to take these medicines on your own without first checking with your doctor.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients.

Vincristine may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. Other people living in your household should not take or should not have recently taken oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you.

If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.</p><p>If vincristine accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and cause scarring.
