Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is  Cablivi given?</h2><p>Cablivi is injected under the skin, or given as an infusion into a vein.

This medicine is then continued for 30 days or longer after your last daily plasma exchange.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Cablivi must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. When using injections by yourself, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine looks cloudy, has changed colors, or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>If you need surgery, dental work, or a medical procedure, you may need to stop using Cablivi for at least 7 days ahead.

Keep track of when you took the carton out of the refrigerator, and do not return it to the refrigerator once the medicine has reached room temperature.</p><p>If you cannot use the mixed medicine right away, store it in the refrigerator and use it within 4 hours.</p><p>Each vial (bottle) is for one use only. Throw it away after one use, even if there is still medicine left inside.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you miss a dose while you are receiving daily plasma exchanges: Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><p>If you miss a dose and are no longer receiving plasma exchanges: Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if you are more than 12 hours late for the dose.
