</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Oseltamivir Phosphate for Oral Suspension is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir or any component of the product. Severe allergic reactions have included anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens - Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens - Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension. Stop oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension and institute appropriate treatment if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. The use of oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Neuropsychiatric Events</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. Closely monitor oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension-treated patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension for each patient.</p><h3>Risk of Bacterial Infections</h3><p class="First">There is no evidence for efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.</p><h3>Fructose Intolerance in Patients with Hereditary Fructose Intolerance</h3><p class="First">Fructose can be harmful to patients with hereditary fructose intolerance. One dose of 75 mg oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension delivers 2 grams of sorbitol. This is above the daily maximum limit of sorbitol for patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, and may cause dyspepsia and diarrhea.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Neuropsychiatric events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older)</span></p><p>The overall safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate is based on data from 2,646 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days for treatment of influenza and 1,943 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally once daily for up to 6 weeks for prophylaxis of influenza in clinical trials.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions in the pooled treatment and pooled prophylaxis trials in adults and adolescents are displayed in Table 5. The majority of these adverse reactions were reported on a single occasion, occurred on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within 1 to 2 days. This summary includes otherwise healthy adults/adolescents and subjects "at risk" (subjects at higher risk of developing complications associated with influenza, e.g., elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, the safety profile in the subjects "at risk" was qualitatively similar to that in otherwise healthy adults/adolescents.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)</span></p><p>A total of 1,481 pediatric subjects (including otherwise healthy pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years and asthmatic pediatric subjects aged 6 to 12 years) participated in clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza. A total of 859 pediatric subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension either at a 2 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days or weight-band dosing. Vomiting was the only adverse reaction reported at a frequency of greater than 1% in subjects receiving Oseltamivir phosphate (16%) compared to placebo (8%).</p><p>Amongst the 148 pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years who received oseltamivir phosphate at doses of 30 mg to 60 mg once daily for 10 days in a post-exposure prophylaxis study in household contacts (n = 99), and in a separate 6–week seasonal influenza prophylaxis safety study (n = 49), vomiting was the most frequent adverse reaction (8% on oseltamivir phosphate versus 2% in the no prophylaxis group).</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from Treatment Trials in Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)</span></p><p>Assessment of adverse reactions in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age was based on two open-label studies that included safety data on 135 influenza-infected subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age) exposed to oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 mg to 3.5 mg per kg of the formulation for oral suspension twice daily orally for 5 days. The safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate was similar across the age range studied, with vomiting (9%), diarrhea (7%) and diaper rash (7%) being the most frequently reported adverse reactions, and was generally comparable to that observed in older pediatric and adult subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from the Prophylaxis Trial in Immunocompromised Subjects</span></p><p>In a 12-week seasonal prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised subjects, including 18 pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age, the safety profile in the 238 subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily was consistent with that previously observed in other oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oseltamivir phosphate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to oseltamivir phosphate exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions:</span> Swelling of the face or tongue, allergy, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, hypothermia</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:</span> Rash, dermatitis, urticaria, eczema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> Gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic colitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Disorders:</span> Arrhythmia</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary Disorders:</span> Hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders:</span> Seizure</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:</span> Aggravation of diabetes</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> Abnormal behavior, delirium, including symptoms such as hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, altered level of consciousness, confusion, nightmares, delusions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Influenza Vaccines</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine</span></p><p>The concurrent use of oseltamivir phosphate with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated. However, because of the potential for oseltamivir phosphate to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus and possibly reduce the efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after oseltamivir phosphate administration, unless medically indicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Inactivated Influenza Vaccine</span></p><p>Inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of oseltamivir phosphate.</p><h3>Drugs Without Clinically Significant Drug Interaction with Oseltamivir Phosphate for Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustments are needed for either oseltamivir or the concomitant drug when coadministering oseltamivir with amoxicillin, acetaminophen, aspirin, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminum hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine, amantadine, or warfarin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Risk Summary<br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with oseltamivir phosphate in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Available published epidemiological data suggest that oseltamivir phosphate, taken in any trimester, is not associated with an increased risk of birth defects. However, these studies individually are limited by small sample sizes, use of different comparison groups, and some lacked information on dose, which preclude a definitive assessment of the risk <span class="Italics">[see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. In animal reproduction studies with oseltamivir, no adverse developmental effects were observed at clinically relevant exposures <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold"><br/>
Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe complications from influenza, which may lead to adverse pregnancy and/or fetal outcomes including maternal death, still births, birth defects, preterm delivery, low birth weight and small for gestational age.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Published prospective and retrospective observational studies of more than 5,000 women exposed to oseltamivir during pregnancy, including more than 1,000 women exposed in the first trimester, suggest that the observed rate of congenital malformations was not increased above the rate in the general comparison population, regardless of when therapy was administered during the gestational period. However, individually, none of these studies had adequate sample sizes and some lacked information on dose, which preclude a definitive assessment of the risk.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Oseltamivir was administered orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats (at 50 mg/kg/day, 250 mg/kg/day, or 1500 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 to 17) and rabbits (at 50 mg/kg/day, 150 mg/kg/day, or 500 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 to 18). In rats, embryo-fetal effects consisting of an increased incidence of minor skeletal malformations were observed at a maternally toxic dose (1500 mg/kg/day), resulting in systemic drug exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) 190 times human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice a day). In the rabbit study, embryo-fetal effects consisting of an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities and variants were observed at maternally toxic doses (greater than or equal to150 mg/kg/day) resulting in systemic exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) greater than or equal to 8 times human exposures at the MRHD of oseltamivir phosphate.</p><p>In prenatal and postnatal development studies in rats, oseltamivir was administered orally (at 50 mg/kg/day, 250 mg/kg/day, 500 mg/kg/day, or 1500 mg/kg/day) from organogenesis through late gestation, delivery, and lactation (gestation day 6 to postpartum/lactation day 20). Prolonged parturition duration and reduced offspring viability were observed at a maternally toxic dose (1500 mg/kg/day). No adverse maternal or offspring effects were observed at doses less than or equal to 500 mg/kg/day, resulting in systemic drug exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) 44 times human exposures at the MRHD of oseltamivir phosphate.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for oseltamivir phosphate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment of Influenza</span></p><p>The safety and efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span> and is based on:</p><ul class="Disc">

Coadministration with food had no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration (551 ng/mL under fasted conditions and 441 ng/mL under fed conditions) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (6,218 ng∙h/mL under fasted conditions and 6,069 ng∙h/mL under fed conditions) of oseltamivir carboxylate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) of oseltamivir carboxylate, following intravenous administration in 24 subjects (oseltamivir phosphate is not available as an IV formulation), ranged between 23 and 26 liters.</p><p>The binding of oseltamivir carboxylate to human plasma protein is low (3%). The binding of oseltamivir to human plasma protein is 42%, which is insufficient to cause significant displacement-based drug interactions.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (greater than 90%) eliminated by conversion to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir declined with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours in most subjects after oral administration. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate declined with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects after oral administration.</p><p>Metabolism</p><p>Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms.</p><p>Excretion</p><p>Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated entirely (greater than 99%) by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 L/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h), indicating that tubular secretion (via organic anion transporter) occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20% of an oral radiolabeled dose is eliminated in feces.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Renal Impairment</p><p>Administration of 100 mg of oseltamivir phosphate twice daily (about 1.3 times the maximum recommended dosage) for 5 days to subjects with various degrees of renal impairment showed that exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate is inversely proportional to declining renal function.</p><p>Population-derived pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for patients with varying degrees of renal function including ESRD patients on hemodialysis. Median simulated exposures of oseltamivir carboxylate for recommended treatment and prophylaxis regimens are provided in Table 7. The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir have not been studied in ESRD patients not undergoing dialysis <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><p>In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, the peak concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate following a single 30 mg dose of oseltamivir or once weekly oseltamivir was approximately 3-fold higher than in patients with normal renal function who received 75 mg twice daily. The plasma concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate on Day 5 (147 ng/mL) following a single 30 mg dose in CAPD patients is similar to the predicted C<span class="Sub">min</span> (160 ng/mL) in patients with normal renal function following 75 mg twice daily. Administration of 30 mg once weekly to CAPD patients resulted in plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate at the 168 hour blood sample of 63 ng/mL, which were comparable to the C<span class="Sub">min</span> in patients with normal renal function receiving the approved regimen of 75 mg once daily (40 ng/mL).</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>In clinical studies, oseltamivir carboxylate exposure was not altered in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnant Women</span></p><p>A pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the oseltamivir phosphate dosage regimen resulted in lower exposure to the active metabolite in pregnant women (n=59) compared to non-pregnant women (n=33). However, this predicted exposure is expected to have activity against susceptible influenza virus strains and there are insufficient pharmacokinetics and safety data to recommend a dose adjustment for pregnant women <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been evaluated in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects aged 5 to 16 years (n=18) and in a small number of pediatric subjects aged 3 to 12 years (n=5) enrolled in a clinical trial. Younger pediatric subjects cleared both the prodrug and the active metabolite faster than adult subjects resulting in a lower exposure for a given mg/kg dose. For oseltamivir carboxylate, apparent total clearance decreases linearly with increasing age (up to 12 years). The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir in pediatric subjects over 12 years of age are similar to those in adult subjects <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been evaluated in two open-label studies of pediatric subjects less than one year of age (n=122) infected with influenza. Apparent clearance of the active metabolite decreases with decreasing age in subjects less than 1 year of age; however the oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate exposure following a 3 mg/kg dose in subjects under 1 year of age is expected to be within the observed exposures in adults and adolescents receiving 75 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>Exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate at steady-state was 25% to 35% higher in geriatric subjects (age range 65 to 78 years) compared to young adults given comparable doses of oseltamivir. Half-lives observed in the geriatric subjects were similar to those seen in young adults. Based on drug exposure and tolerability, dose adjustments are not required for geriatric patients for either treatment or prophylaxis <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>Oseltamivir is extensively converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases, located predominantly in the liver. Drug interactions involving competition for esterases have not been extensively reported in literature. Low protein binding of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate suggests that the probability of drug displacement interactions is low.</p><p>In vitro studies demonstrate that neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a good substrate for P450 mixed-function oxidases or for glucuronyl transferases.</p><p>Coadministration of probenecid results in an approximate two-fold increase in exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate due to a decrease in active anionic tubular secretion in the kidney. However, due to the safety margin of oseltamivir carboxylate, no dose adjustments are required when coadministering with probenecid. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed when coadministering oseltamivir with amoxicillin, acetaminophen, aspirin, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminum hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine, amantadine, or warfarin.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Oseltamivir phosphate is an ethyl ester prodrug requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase affecting release of viral particles. The median IC<span class="Sub">50</span> values of oseltamivir against influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, and influenza B clinical isolates were 2.5 nM (range 0.93-4.16 nM, N=74), 0.96 nM (range 0.13-7.95 nM, N=774), and 60 nM (20-285 nM, N=256), respectively, in a neuraminidase assay with a fluorescently labeled MUNANA substrate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity</span></p><p>The antiviral activity of oseltamivir carboxylate against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza virus was determined in cell culture. The concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate required for inhibition of influenza virus in cell culture were highly variable depending on the assay method used and the virus tested. The 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC<span class="Sub">50</span> and EC<span class="Sub">90</span>) were in the range of 0.0008 micromolar to greater than 35 micromolar and 0.004 micromolar to greater than 100 micromolar, respectively (1 micromolar=0.284 microgram per mL). The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture, inhibitory activity in the neuraminidase assay, and the inhibition of influenza virus replication in humans has not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>Cell culture studies: Influenza A virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate have been recovered by serial passage of virus in cell culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate. Reduced susceptibility of influenza virus to inhibition by oseltamivir carboxylate may be conferred by amino acid substitutions in the viral neuraminidase and/or hemagglutinin proteins.</p><p>Clinical studies: Reduced susceptibility isolates have been obtained during treatment with oseltamivir and from sampling during community surveillance studies. Changes in the viral neuraminidase that have been associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate are summarized in Table 8. The clinical impact of this reduced susceptibility is unknown.</p><p>Hemagglutinin (HA) substitutions selected in cell culture and associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir include (influenza virus subtype-specific numbering) A11T, K173E, and R453M in H3N2; and H99Q in influenza B virus (Yamagata lineage). In some cases, HA substitutions were selected in conjunction with known NA resistance substitutions and may contribute to reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir; however, the impact of HA substitutions on antiviral activity of oseltamivir in humans is unknown and likely to be strain-dependent.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 8: Neuraminidase Amino Acid Substitutions Associated with Reduced Susceptibility to Oseltamivir</span></p><p>*All numbering in N2, except where indicated</p><p>Selection of influenza A viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies in children. Oseltamivir treatment-associated resistance in pediatric treatment studies has been detected at frequencies of 27% to 37% and 3% to 18% (3/11 to 7/19 and 1/34 to 9/50 post-treatment isolates, respectively) for influenza A/H1N1 virus and influenza A/H3N2 virus, respectively.</p><p>The frequency of resistance selection to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such resistant virus vary seasonally and geographically.</p><p>Circulating seasonal influenza strains expressing neuraminidase resistance-associated substitutions have been observed in individuals who have not received oseltamivir treatment. The oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution H275Y was found in more than 99% of US-circulating 2008 H1N1 influenza virus isolates. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus ("swine flu") was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir; however, the frequency of circulating resistant variants can change from season to season. Prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cross-resistance</span></p><p>Cross-resistance between oseltamivir and zanamivir has been observed in neuraminidase biochemical assays. The H275Y (N1 numbering) or N294S (N2 numbering) oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in the N1 neuraminidase subtype, and the E119V or N294S oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in the N2 subtype (N2 numbering), are associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir but not zanamivir. The Q136K and K150T zanamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in N1 neuraminidase, or the S250G zanamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in influenza B virus neuraminidase, confer reduced susceptibility to zanamivir but not oseltamivir. The R292K oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution observed in N2, and the I222T, D198E/N, R371K, or G402S oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in influenza B virus neuraminidase, confer reduced susceptibility to both oseltamivir and zanamivir. These examples do not represent an exhaustive list of cross resistance-associated substitutions and prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension.</p><p>No single amino acid substitution has been identified that could confer cross-resistance between the neuraminidase inhibitor class (oseltamivir, zanamivir) and the M2 ion channel inhibitor class (amantadine, rimantadine). However, a virus may carry a neuraminidase inhibitor associated substitution in neuraminidase and an M2 ion channel inhibitor-associated substitution in M2 and may therefore be resistant to both classes of inhibitors. The clinical relevance of phenotypic cross-resistance evaluations has not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immune Response</span></p><p>No influenza vaccine/oseltamivir interaction study has been conducted. In studies of naturally acquired and experimental influenza, treatment with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension did not impair normal humoral antibody response to infection.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats given daily oral doses of the prodrug oseltamivir phosphate up to 400 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, respectively, the prodrug and the active form oseltamivir carboxylate induced no statistically significant increases in tumors over controls. The mean maximum daily exposures to the prodrug in mice and rats were approximately 130- and 320-fold, respectively, greater than those in humans at the recommended clinical dose based on AUC comparisons. The respective safety margins of the exposures to the active oseltamivir carboxylate were 15- and 50-fold.</p><p>Oseltamivir was found to be non-mutagenic in the Ames test and the human lymphocyte chromosome assay with and without enzymatic activation and negative in the mouse micronucleus test. It was found to be positive in a Syrian Hamster Embryo (SHE) cell transformation test. Oseltamivir carboxylate was non-mutagenic in the Ames test and the L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay with and without enzymatic activation and negative in the SHE cell transformation test.</p><p>In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, doses of oseltamivir at 50 mg/kg/day, 250 mg/kg/day, and 1500 mg/kg/day were administered to females for 2 weeks before mating, during mating and until day 6 of pregnancy. Males were dosed for 4 weeks before mating, during mating, and for 2 weeks after mating. There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development at any dose level. The highest dose in this study was approximately 115 times the human systemic exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span>) of oseltamivir carboxylate that occurs after administration of the maximum recommended human dose.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Treatment of Influenza</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza.

Subjects were randomized to receive oral oseltamivir phosphate suspension or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.</p><p>Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.</p><p>Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none," "mild," "moderate," or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.</p><p>In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adolescents and Adults with Chronic Cardiac or Respiratory Disease</span></p><p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was unable to demonstrate efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) in the treatment of influenza in adult and adolescent subjects (13 years or older) with chronic cardiac (excluding chronic idiopathic hypertension) or respiratory diseases, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms. However, in patients treated with oseltamivir phosphate there was a more rapid cessation of febrile illness. No difference in the incidence of influenza complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Subjects</span></p><p>Three double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trials were conducted in subjects who were at least 65 years of age in three consecutive seasons. The enrollment criteria were similar to that of adult trials with the exception of fever being defined as higher than 97.5°F.

Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.</p><p>Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in male and female pediatric subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)</span></p><p>Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age).

These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.</p><p>Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%). Pharmacokinetic data indicated that a dose of 3 mg per kg twice daily in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age provided oseltamivir phosphate concentrations similar to or higher than those observed in older pediatric subjects and adults receiving the approved dose and provided the basis for approval <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>Prophylaxis of Influenza</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older)</span></p><p>The efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in preventing naturally occurring influenza illness has been demonstrated in three seasonal prophylaxis (community outbreak) clinical trials and one post-exposure prophylaxis trial in household contacts.

Median time since transplant for solid organ transplant recipients was 1,105 days for the placebo group and 1,379 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Median time since transplant for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 424 days for the placebo group and 367 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Approximately 40% of subjects received influenza vaccine prior to entering the study.
