</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Eysuvis</h2><p class="First">Eysuvis is a corticosteroid indicated for the short-term (up to two weeks) treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.</p><h2>Eysuvis Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage Information</h3><p class="First">Instill one to two drops of Eysuvis into each eye four times daily for up to two weeks. This product should only be renewed after examination under magnification such as a slit lamp and evaluation of the intraocular pressure. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Instruct patient to wash hands well before each use. Shake for two to three seconds before using.</p><p>If the patient is using other eye drops in addition to Eysuvis, advise the patient to wait at least 5 minutes between instillation of Eysuvis and other eye drops.</p><p>If a dose is missed, take the missed dose when remembered.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Ophthalmic suspension containing 2.5 mg/mL of loteprednol etabonate.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Eysuvis, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Delayed Healing and Corneal Perforation</h3><p class="First">Topical corticosteroids have been known to delay healing and cause corneal and scleral thinning. Use of topical corticosteroids in the presence of thin corneal or scleral tissue may lead to perforation. The initial prescription and each renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.</p><h3>Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, as well as defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Corticosteroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient and evaluation of the IOP.</p><h3>Cataracts</h3><p class="First">Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation.</p><h3>Bacterial Infections</h3><p class="First">Use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, corticosteroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection.</p><h3>Viral Infections</h3><p class="First">Use of corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular corticosteroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex).</p><h3>Fungal Infections</h3><p class="First">Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local corticosteroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate.</p><h3>Risk of Contamination</h3><p class="First">Do not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension.</p><h3>Contact Lens Wear</h3><p class="First">The preservative in Eysuvis may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of Eysuvis and may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions associated with ophthalmic corticosteroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with infrequent optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, delayed wound healing and secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The most common adverse reaction observed in clinical trials with Eysuvis was instillation site pain, which was reported in 5% of patients.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses 1.4 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses 34 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses 3.4 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses 347 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 34 times the RHOD.</p><p>The background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at 0.1 mg/kg (1.4 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at 0.1 mg/kg, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at 0.4 mg/kg (5.6 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg (41 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at 6 mg/kg (83 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at 5 mg/kg (34 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at 50 mg/kg (347 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg (695 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg (3.4 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg.</p><p>A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At 0.5 mg/kg (3.4 times the clinical dose), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses ≥ 5 mg/kg (34 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses ≥ 50 mg/kg (347 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother’s clinical need for Eysuvis and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Eysuvis.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients.</p><h2>Eysuvis Description</h2><p class="First">Loteprednol etabonate is a corticosteroid. Its chemical name is chloromethyl 17α-[(ethoxycarbonyl)oxy]-11β-hydroxy-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17β-carboxylate. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">24</span>H<span class="Sub">31</span>ClO<span class="Sub">7</span> and its chemical structure is:</p><p><br/>

Mol. Wt. 467.0</p><p>Eysuvis (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension) 0.25% contains a sterile, topical anti-inflammatory corticosteroid for ophthalmic use. Each mL contains:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>ACTIVE: loteprednol etabonate 2.5 mg (0.25%)</li>
<li>INACTIVES: glycerin, sodium citrate dihydrate, sodium chloride, Poloxamer 407, edetate disodium dihydrate, citric acid, and water for injection.</li>
<li>PRESERVATIVE: benzalkonium chloride 0.01%</li>
</ul><h2>Eysuvis - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and delay or slow healing. Corticosteroids inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. While glucocorticoids are known to bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor, the molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor-dependent modulation of inflammation are not clearly established. However, corticosteroids are thought to inhibit prostaglandin production.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Loteprednol etabonate is lipid soluble and can penetrate into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites, PJ-91 and PJ-90.</p><p>Following bilateral topical ocular dosing of two drops of Eysuvis four times a day for 14 days in 20 healthy adult subjects, the plasma concentrations of loteprednol etabonate were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all timepoints.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase (tk) assay, in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in the single dose mouse micronucleus assay. Treatment of male and female rats with 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate (174 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption) prior to and during mating caused pre-implantation loss and decreased the number of live fetuses/live births. The NOAEL for fertility in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (34 times the RHOD).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Eysuvis for the treatment of dry eye disease was assessed in approximately 2900 patients with dry eye disease. Patients received either Eysuvis or vehicle (1:1 ratio) four times a day for 2 weeks in 4 multi-centered, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials. The use of artificial tears was not allowed during the trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on Symptoms of Dry Eye Disease</span></p><p>Ocular discomfort severity (ODS) was rated by patients daily over the course of the trial using a visual analog scale (0 = very mild, 100 = very severe). A larger reduction in ocular discomfort severity favoring Eysuvis was observed at Day 15 in the patient population (see Figure 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Mean Change (SD) from Baseline and Treatment Difference (Eysuvis-<br/>
Vehicle) in Ocular Discomfort Severity Score in Patients with Dry Eye Disease</span></p><p></p><p>Treatment differences between the Eysuvis and vehicle groups are displayed for each study, based on least square means and 2-sided confidence intervals for the change from baseline.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on Signs of Dry Eye Disease</span></p><p>Conjunctival hyperemia was graded using the Cornea and Contact Lens Research Unit (CCLRU) grading scale (0 = none; 1 = very slight; 2 = slight; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe). A larger reduction in hyperemia favoring Eysuvis was observed at Day 15 in all four trials (Figure 2).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Mean Change (SD) from Baseline and Treatment Difference (Eysuvis-<br/>
