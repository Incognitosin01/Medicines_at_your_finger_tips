If ovulation occurs too soon during fertility treatment, the eggs may not be suitable for fertilization. This medicine works by preventing eggs from being released too early (premature ovulation).</p><p>Cetrotide is used to prevent premature ovulation during controlled ovarian stimulation.</p><p>Cetrotide may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Cetrotide if you have severe kidney disease, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, or if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to this medicine (such as Lupron, Antagon, Zoladex, Synarel, Zoladex, or others).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Cetrotide if you are allergic to it, or if:</p><ul>

Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Cetrotide is injected under the skin. You may be shown how to use injections at home. Do not give yourself this medicine if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes.</p><p>Cetrotide is a powder medicine that must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. If you are using the injections at home, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine.</p><p>Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject Cetrotide. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row.</p><p><b>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you</b>. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>For best results, you will need to start using Cetrotide injections on a certain day of your cycle. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions about when to use this medicine, and at what time of day to give your injections.</p><p>As part of your fertility treatment, you will be treated with a second medicine called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). You will receive an hCG injection only on days when your ovaries are ready for controlled ovulation to occur.</p><p>You will need frequent ultrasound examinations to check your ovaries for signs of readiness for ovulation. This will help your doctor determine when to give your hCG injection.</p><p>Store Cetrotide in a refrigerator. Do not freeze. Keep the medicine in its original carton to protect it from light. Throw away any medicine not used before the expiration date on the medicine label.</p><p>Use a disposable needle and syringe only once. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes. Use a puncture-proof "sharps" disposal container (ask your pharmacist where to get one and how to throw it away).
