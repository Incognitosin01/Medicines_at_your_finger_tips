</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone for injection and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p><h2>Ceftriaxone Description</h2><p class="First">Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is a sterile, semisynthetic, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic for intravenous or intramuscular administration. Ceftriaxone sodium is (6<span class="Italics">R</span>,7<span class="Italics">R</span>)-7-[2-(2-Amino-4-thiazolyl)glyoxylamido]-8-oxo-3-[[(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-2-methyl-5,6-dioxo-<span class="Italics">as</span>-triazin-3-yl)thio]methyl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid, 7<span class="Sup">2</span>-(<span class="Italics">Z</span>)-(<span class="Italics">O</span>-methyloxime), disodium salt, sesquaterhydrate.</p><p>The chemical formula of Ceftriaxone sodium is C<span class="Sub">1</span><span class="Sub">8</span>H<span class="Sub">1</span><span class="Sub">6</span>N<span class="Sub">8</span>Na<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">7</span>S<span class="Sub">3</span>•3.5H<span class="Sub">2</span>O. It has a calculated molecular weight of 661.59 and the following structural formula:</p><p>Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is a white to yellowish-orange crystalline powder which is readily soluble in water, sparingly soluble in methanol and very slightly soluble in ethanol. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution is approximately 6.7. The color of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP solutions ranges from light yellow to amber, depending on the length of storage, concentration and diluent used.</p><p>Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP contains approximately 83 mg (3.6 mEq) of sodium per gram of Ceftriaxone activity.</p><h2>Ceftriaxone - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Average plasma concentrations of Ceftriaxone following a single 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of a 0.5, 1 or 2 gm dose and intramuscular (IM) administration of a single 0.5 (250 mg/mL or 350 mg/mL concentrations) or 1 gm dose in healthy subjects are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>.</p><p>Ceftriaxone was completely absorbed following IM administration with mean maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 2 and 3 hours post-dose. Multiple IV or IM doses ranging from 0.5 to 2 gm at 12 to 24 hour intervals resulted in 15% to 36% accumulation of Ceftriaxone above single dose values.</p><p>Ceftriaxone concentrations in urine are shown in <span class="Bold">Table 2</span>.</p><p>Thirty-three percent to 67% of a Ceftriaxone dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and the remainder was secreted in the bile and ultimately found in the feces as microbiologically inactive compounds. After a 1 gm IV dose, average concentrations of Ceftriaxone, determined from 1 to 3 hours after dosing, were 581 mcg/mL in the gallbladder bile, 788 mcg/mL in the common duct bile, 898 mcg/mL in the cystic duct bile, 78.2 mcg/gm in the gallbladder wall and 62.1 mcg/mL in the concurrent plasma.</p><p>Over a 0.15 to 3 gm dose range in healthy adult subjects, the values of elimination half-life ranged from 5.8 to 8.7 hours; apparent volume of distribution from 5.78 to 13.5 L; plasma clearance from 0.58 to 1.45 L/hour; and renal clearance from 0.32 to 0.73 L/hour.</p><p>Ceftriaxone is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, and the binding decreased from a value of 95% bound at plasma concentrations of &lt; 25 mcg/mL to a value of 85% bound at 300 mcg/mL. Ceftriaxone crosses the blood placenta barrier.</p><p>The average values of maximum plasma concentration, elimination half-life, plasma clearance and volume of distribution after a 50 mg/kg IV dose and after a 75 mg/kg IV dose in pediatric patients suffering from bacterial meningitis are shown in <span class="Bold">Table 3</span>.</p><p>Ceftriaxone penetrated the inflamed meninges of infants and pediatric patients; CSF concentrations after a 50 mg/kg IV dose and after a 75 mg/kg IV dose are also shown in <span class="Bold">Table 3</span>.</p><p>Compared to that in healthy adult subjects, the pharmacokinetics of Ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in elderly subjects and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic dysfunction (<span class="Bold">Table 4</span>); therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary for these patients with Ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 gm per day. Ceftriaxone was not removed to any significant extent from the plasma by hemodialysis; in six of 26 dialysis patients, the elimination rate of Ceftriaxone was markedly reduced.</p><p>*Creatinine clearance.</p><p>The elimination of Ceftriaxone is not altered when Ceftriaxone for injection is co-administered with probenecid.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics in the Middle Ear Fluid</h3><p class="First">In one study, total Ceftriaxone concentrations (bound and unbound) were measured in middle ear fluid obtained during the insertion of tympanostomy tubes in 42 pediatric patients with otitis media. Sampling times were from 1 to 50 hours after a single intramuscular injection of 50 mg/kg of Ceftriaxone. Mean (± SD) Ceftriaxone levels in the middle ear reached a peak of 35 (± 12) mcg/mL at 24 hours, and remained at 19 (± 7) mcg/‌mL at 48 hours. Based on middle ear fluid Ceftriaxone concentrations in the 23 to 25 hour and the 46 to 50 hour sampling time intervals, a half-life of 25 hours was calculated. Ceftriaxone is highly bound to plasma proteins. The extent of binding to proteins in the middle ear fluid is unknown.</p><h3>Interaction with Calcium</h3><p class="First">Two <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, one using adult plasma and the other neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood have been carried out to assess interaction of Ceftriaxone and calcium. Ceftriaxone concentrations up to 1 mM (in excess of concentrations achieved <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> following administration of 2 grams Ceftriaxone infused over 30 minutes) were used in combination with calcium concentrations up to 12 mM (48 mg/‌dL). Recovery of Ceftriaxone from plasma was reduced with calcium concentrations of 6 mM (24 mg/‌dL) or higher in adult plasma or 4 mM (16 mg/‌dL) or higher in neonatal plasma. This may be reflective of Ceftriaxone-calcium precipitation.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.</p><p class="First">Resistance to Ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.</p><p class="First">In an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and Ceftriaxone.</p><p class="First">Ceftriaxone has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section:<br/>

Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.</p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:</p><p><span class="Italics">LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis</span> or <span class="Italics">Serratia marcescens.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">ACUTE BACTERIAL OTITIS MEDIA</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae</span> (including beta‑lactamase producing strains) or <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span> (including beta-lactamase producing strains).</p><p>NOTE: In one study lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP compared to 10 days of oral therapy. In a second study comparable cure rates were observed between single dose of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP and the comparator. The potentially lower clinical cure rate of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP should be balanced against the potential advantages of parenteral therapy (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics">SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes</span>, Viridans group streptococci, <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae,</span> <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii<span class="Sup">1</span>,</span> <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis<span class="Sup">1</span></span> or <span class="Italics">Peptostreptococcus</span> species.</p><p><span class="Italics">URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS (complicated and uncomplicated)</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii</span> or <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">UNCOMPLICATED GONORRHEA (cervical/urethral and rectal)</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae,</span> including both penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains, and pharyngeal gonorrhea caused by nonpenicillinase‑producing strains of <span class="Italics">Neisseria</span> <span class="Italics">gonorrhoeae.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</span> Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against <span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span>. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and <span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added.</p><p><span class="Italics">BACTERIAL SEPTICEMIA</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae</span> or <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae</span> or <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species.</p><p><span class="Italics">INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium</span> species (Note: most strains of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> are resistant) or <span class="Italics">Peptostreptococcus</span> species.</p><p><span class="Italics">MENINGITIS</span> caused by <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis</span> or <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae.</span> Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP has also been used successfully in a limited number of cases of meningitis and shunt infection caused by <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis<span class="Sup">1</span></span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli.<span class="Sup">1</span></span></p><p><span class="Sup">1</span>Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than ten infections.</p><h3>SURGICAL PROPHYLAXIS</h3><p class="First">The preoperative administration of a single 1 gm dose of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP may reduce the incidence of postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g.<span class="Italics">,</span> vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy or cholecystectomy for chronic calculous cholecystitis in high-risk patients, such as those over 70 years of age, with acute cholecystitis not requiring therapeutic antimicrobials, obstructive jaundice or common duct bile stones) and in surgical patients for whom infection at the operative site would present serious risk (e.g.<span class="Italics">,</span> during coronary artery bypass surgery). Although Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP has been shown to have been as effective as cefazolin in the prevention of infection following coronary artery bypass surgery, no placebo-controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate any cephalosporin antibiotic in the prevention of infection following coronary artery bypass surgery.</p><p>When administered prior to surgical procedures for which it is indicated, a single 1 gm dose of Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP provides protection from most infections due to susceptible organisms throughout the course of the procedure.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Ceftriaxone, any of its excipients or to any other cephalosporin. Patients with previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin and other beta lactam antibacterial agents may be at greater risk of hypersensitivity to Ceftriaxone (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS – Hypersensitivity</span>).</p><h3>Neonates</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Premature neonates:</span> Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in premature neonates up to a postmenstrual age of 41 weeks (gestational age + chronological age).</p><p><span class="Italics">Hyperbilirubinemic neonates:</span> Hyperbilirubinemic neonates should not be treated with Ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone can displace bilirubin from its binding to serum albumin, leading to a risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in these patients.</p><h3>Neonates Requiring Calcium Containing IV Solutions</h3><p class="First">Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in neonates (≤ 28 days) if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium‑containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of Ceftriaxone‑calcium (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>Cases of fatal outcomes in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy have been reported in neonates receiving Ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids. In some of these cases, the same intravenous infusion line was used for both Ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids and in some a precipitate was observed in the intravenous infusion line. There have been no similar reports in patients other than neonates.</p><h3>Lidocaine</h3><p class="First">Intravenous administration of Ceftriaxone solutions containing lidocaine is contraindicated. When lidocaine solution is used as a solvent with Ceftriaxone for intramuscular injection, exclude all contraindications to lidocaine. Refer to the prescribing information of lidocaine.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Before therapy with Ceftriaxone is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins and other beta-lactam agents or other drugs. This product should be given cautiously to penicillin and other beta-lactam agent‑sensitive patients. Antibacterial drugs should be administered with caution to any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require the use of subcutaneous epinephrine and other emergency measures.</p><p>As with all beta-lactam antibacterial agents, serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis) have been reported. In case of severe hypersensitivity reactions, treatment with Ceftriaxone must be discontinued immediately and adequate emergency measures must be initiated.</p><h3>Methemoglobinemia</h3><p class="First">Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use (e.g. lidocaine). Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue Rocephin Kit and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. More severe symptoms may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen.</p><h3>Interaction with Calcium-Containing Products</h3><p class="First">Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer’s solution or Hartmann’s solution, to reconstitute Ceftriaxone vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of Ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when Ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using adult and neonatal plasma from umbilical cord blood demonstrated that neonates have an increased risk of precipitation of Ceftriaxone-calcium (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Ceftriaxone, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile,</span> and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Hemolytic Anemia</h3><p class="First">An immune mediated hemolytic anemia has been observed in patients receiving cephalosporin class antibacterials including Ceftriaxone. Severe cases of hemolytic anemia, including fatalities, have been reported during treatment in both adults and children. If a patient develops anemia while on Ceftriaxone, the diagnosis of a cephalosporin associated anemia should be considered and Ceftriaxone stopped until the etiology is determined. </p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Ceftriaxone in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Prolonged use of Ceftriaxone may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.</p><h3>Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ceftriaxone is excreted via both biliary and renal excretion (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). Therefore, patients with renal failure normally require no adjustment in dosage when usual doses of Ceftriaxone are administered.</p><p>Dosage adjustments should not be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction; however, in patients with both hepatic dysfunction and significant renal disease, caution should be exercised and the Ceftriaxone dosage should not exceed 2 gm daily.</p><p>Ceftriaxone is not removed by peritoneal- or hemodialysis. In patients undergoing dialysis no additional supplementary dosing is required following the dialysis. In patients with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, close clinical monitoring for safety and efficacy is advised.</p><h3>Effect on Prothrombin Time</h3><p class="First">Alterations in prothrombin times have occurred in patients treated with Ceftriaxone. Monitor prothrombin time during Ceftriaxone treatment in patients with impaired vitamin K synthesis or low vitamin K stores (e.g., chronic hepatic disease and malnutrition). Vitamin K administration (10 mg weekly) may be necessary if the prothrombin time is prolonged before or during therapy.</p><p>Concomitant use of Ceftriaxone with Vitamin K antagonists may increase the risk of bleeding. Coagulation parameters should be monitored frequently, and the dose of the anticoagulant adjusted accordingly, both during and after treatment with Ceftriaxone (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><h3>Gallbladder Pseudolithiasis</h3><p class="First">Ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates in the gallbladder have been observed in patients receiving Ceftriaxone. These precipitates appear on sonography as an echo without acoustical shadowing suggesting sludge or as an echo with acoustical shadowing which may be misinterpreted as gallstones. The probability of such precipitates appears to be greatest in pediatric patients. Patients may be asymptomatic or may develop symptoms of gallbladder disease. The condition appears to be reversible upon discontinuation of Ceftriaxone sodium and institution of conservative management. Discontinue Ceftriaxone sodium  in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of gallbladder disease and/‌or the sonographic findings described above.</p><h3>Urolithiasis and Post-Renal Acute Renal Failure</h3><p class="First">Ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates in the urinary tract have been observed in patients receiving Ceftriaxone and may be detected as sonographic abnormalities. The probability of such precipitates appears to be greatest in pediatric patients. Patients may be asymptomatic or may develop symptoms of urolithiasis, and ureteral obstruction and post-renal acute renal failure. The condition appears to be reversible upon discontinuation of Ceftriaxone sodium and institution of appropriate management. Ensure adequate hydration in patients receiving Ceftriaxone. Discontinue Ceftriaxone in patients who develop signs and symptoms suggestive of urolithiasis, oliguria or renal failure and/or the sonographic findings described above.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Cases of pancreatitis, possibly secondary to biliary obstruction, have been reported in patients treated with Ceftriaxone. Most patients presented with risk factors for biliary stasis and biliary sludge (preceding major therapy, severe illness, total parenteral nutrition). A cofactor role of Ceftriaxone-related biliary precipitation cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><ul class="Disk">
<li>
<p class="First">Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue.</p>
</li>
<li>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ceftriaxone should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., common cold).</li>
<li>When Ceftriaxone is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ceftriaxone or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</li>
<li>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</li>

The maximum duration of animal toxicity studies was 6 months.</p><p><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis:</span> Genetic toxicology tests included the Ames test, a micronucleus test and a test for chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes cultured <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> with Ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone showed no potential for mutagenic activity in these studies.</p><p><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility:</span> Ceftriaxone produced no impairment of fertility when given intravenously to rats at daily doses up to 586 mg/kg/day, approximately 20 times the recommended clinical dose of 2 gm/day.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category B. Reproductive studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 20 times the usual human dose and have no evidence of embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity or teratogenicity. In primates, no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was demonstrated at a dose approximately 3 times the human dose.</p><p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p class="First">In rats, in the Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) and Segment III (perinatal and postnatal) studies with intravenously administered Ceftriaxone, no adverse effects were noted on various reproductive parameters during gestation and lactation, including postnatal growth, functional behavior and reproductive ability of the offspring, at doses of 586 mg/kg/day or less.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Low concentrations of Ceftriaxone are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Ceftriaxone is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Ceftriaxone in neonates, infants and pediatric patients have been established for the dosages described in the <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> section. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that Ceftriaxone, like some other cephalosporins, can displace bilirubin from serum albumin. Ceftriaxone should not be administered to hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of Ceftriaxone, 32% were 60 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of Ceftriaxone were only minimally altered in geriatric patients compared to healthy adult subjects and dosage adjustments are not necessary for geriatric patients with Ceftriaxone dosages up to 2 grams per day provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><h3>Influence on Diagnostic Tests</h3><p class="First">In patients treated with Ceftriaxone the Coombs’ test may become positive. Ceftriaxone, like other antibacterial drugs, may result in positive test results for galactosemia.</p><p>Nonenzymatic methods for the glucose determination in urine may give false-positive results. For this reason, urine-glucose determination during therapy with Ceftriaxone should be done enzymatically.</p><p>The presence of Ceftriaxone may falsely lower estimated blood glucose values obtained with some blood glucose monitoring systems. Please refer to instructions for use for each system. Alternative testing methods should be used if necessary.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Patients that are administered local anesthetics may be at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following oxidizing agents:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Class</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Examples</span></p><p class="First">Nitrates/Nitrites</p><p class="First">Nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide</p><p class="First">Local anesthetics</p><p class="First">Benzocaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine, tetracaine, prilocaine, procaine, articaine</p><p class="First">Antineoplastic agents</p><p class="First">cyclophosphamide, flutamide, rasburicase, isofamide, hydroxyurea</p><p class="First">Antibiotics</p><p class="First">dapsone, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, para­ aminosalicylic acid</p><p class="First">Antimalarials</p><p class="First">chloroquine, primaquine</p><p class="First">Anticonvulsants</p><p class="First">phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbital</p><p class="First">Other drugs</p><p class="First">acetaminophen, metoclopramide, sulfa drugs (i.e., sulfasalazine), quinine</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Ceftriaxone is generally well tolerated. In clinical trials, the following adverse reactions, which were considered to be related to Ceftriaxone therapy or of uncertain etiology, were observed:</p><p><span class="Italics">LOCAL REACTIONS</span> – pain, induration and tenderness was 1% overall. Phlebitis was reported in &lt; 1% after IV administration. The incidence of warmth, tightness or induration was 17% (3/17) after IM administration of 350 mg/mL and 5% (1/20) after IM administration of 250 mg/mL.</p><p><span class="Italics">GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS —</span> injection site pain (0.6%).</p><p><span class="Italics">HYPERSENSITIVITY</span> – rash (1.7%).

Less frequently reported (&lt; 1%) were anemia, hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and prolongation of the prothrombin time.</p><p><span class="Italics">BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC DISORDERS —</span> granulocytopenia (0.9%), coagulopathy (0.4%).</p><p><span class="Italics">GASTROINTESTINAL</span> – diarrhea/loose stools (2.7%). Less frequently reported (&lt; 1%) were nausea or vomiting, and dysgeusia. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics">HEPATIC</span> – elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (3.1%) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (3.3%). Less frequently reported (&lt; 1%) were elevations of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.</p><p><span class="Italics">RENAL</span> – elevations of the BUN (1.2%). Less frequently reported (&lt; 1%) were elevations of creatinine and the presence of casts in the urine.</p><p><span class="Italics">CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</span> – headache or dizziness were reported occasionally (&lt; 1%).</p><p><span class="Italics">GENITOURINARY</span> – moniliasis or vaginitis were reported occasionally (&lt; 1%).</p><p><span class="Italics">MISCELLANEOUS</span> – diaphoresis and flushing were reported occasionally (&lt; 1%).</p><p>INVESTIGATIONS—blood creatinine increased (0.6%).</p><p>Other rarely observed adverse reactions (&lt; 0.1%) include abdominal pain, agranulocytosis, allergic pneumonitis, anaphylaxis, basophilia, biliary lithiasis, bronchospasm, colitis, dyspepsia, epistaxis, flatulence, gallbladder sludge, glycosuria, hematuria, jaundice, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, monocytosis, nephrolithiasis, palpitations, a decrease in the prothrombin time, renal precipitations, seizures, and serum sickness.</p><h3>Post-marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical trials, the following adverse experiences have been reported during clinical practice in patients treated with Ceftriaxone. Data are generally insufficient to allow an estimate of incidence or to establish causation.</p><p>A small number of cases of fatal outcomes in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy have been reported in neonates receiving Ceftriaxone and calcium-containing fluids. In some of these cases, the same intravenous infusion line was used for both Ceftriaxone and calcium‑containing fluids and in some a precipitate was observed in the intravenous infusion line. At least one fatality has been reported in a neonate in whom Ceftriaxone and calcium‑containing fluids were administered at different time points via different intravenous lines; no crystalline material was observed at autopsy in this neonate. There have been no similar reports in patients other than neonates.</p><p><span class="Italics">GASTROINTESTINAL</span> – pancreatitis, stomatitis and glossitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">GENITOURINARY</span> – oliguria, ureteric obstruction, post-renal acute renal failure.</p><p><span class="Italics">DERMATOLOGIC</span> – exanthema, allergic dermatitis, urticaria, edema; acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and isolated cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Lyell’s syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">HEMATOLOGICAL CHANGES</span> – isolated cases of agranulocytosis (&lt; 500/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) have been reported, most of them after 10 days of treatment and following total doses of 20 g or more.</p><p><span class="Italics">NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS</span> – convulsion.</p><p><span class="Italics">OTHER, Adverse Reactions</span> – symptomatic precipitation of Ceftriaxone calcium salt in the gallbladder, kernicterus, oliguria, and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions.</p><h3>Cephalosporin Class Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with Ceftriaxone, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory test results have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics:</p><p><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions</span>: Allergic reactions, drug fever, serum sickness-like reaction, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, reversible hyperactivity, hypertonia, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, and superinfection.</p><p><span class="Italics">Altered Laboratory Tests:</span> Positive direct Coombs’ test, false-positive test for urinary glucose, and elevated LDH (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p>Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. at 1-877-845-0689, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the case of overdosage, drug concentration would not be reduced by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. There is no specific antidote. Treatment of overdosage should be symptomatic.</p><h2>Ceftriaxone Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Ceftriaxone may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.</p><p>Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer’s solution or Hartmann’s solution, to reconstitute Ceftriaxone vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of Ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when Ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with calcium‑containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, Ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>There have been no reports of an interaction between Ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular Ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral).</p><h3>NEONATES</h3><p class="First">Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with Ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in premature neonates (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><p>Ceftriaxone is contraindicated in neonates (≤28 days) if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium‑containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium‑containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of Ceftriaxone-calcium (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><p>Intravenous doses should be given over 60 minutes in neonates to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.</p><h3>PEDIATRIC PATIENTS</h3><p class="First">For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day). The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams.</p><p>For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span>).</p><p>For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams.</p><p>In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/‌kg/‌day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day (or in equally divided doses every 12 hours). The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days.</p><h3>ADULTS</h3><p class="First">The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams.</p><p>If <span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because Ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.</p><p>For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended.</p><p>For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended.</p><p>Generally, Ceftriaxone therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.</p><p>When treating infections caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.</p><p>No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p>The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2 gm per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><h3>DIRECTIONS FOR USE</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intramuscular Administration:</span> Reconstitute Ceftriaxone powder with the appropriate diluent (see <span class="Bold">COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY</span>).</p><p>Inject diluent into vial, shake vial thoroughly to form solution.

Particulate formation can result.</p><p>Ceftriaxone has been shown to be compatible with Flagyl<span class="Sup">®</span> IV (metronidazole hydrochloride). The concentration should not exceed 5 to 7.5 mg/mL metronidazole hydrochloride with Ceftriaxone 10 mg/mL as an admixture. The admixture is stable for 24 hours at room temperature only in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose in water (D5W). No compatibility studies have been conducted with the Flagyl<span class="Sup">®</span> IV RTU<span class="Sup">®</span> (metronidazole) formulation or using other diluents. Metronidazole at concentrations greater than 8 mg/mL will precipitate. Do not refrigerate the admixture as precipitation will occur.</p><p>Vancomycin, amsacrine, aminoglycosides, and fluconazole are incompatible with Ceftriaxone in admixtures. When any of these drugs are to be administered concomitantly with Ceftriaxone by intermittent intravenous infusion, it is recommended that they be given sequentially, with thorough flushing of the intravenous lines (with one of the compatible fluids) between the administrations.</p><p>Ceftriaxone solutions should <span class="Italics">not</span> be physically mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs or into diluent solutions other than those listed above, due to possible incompatibility (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Ceftriaxone sterile powder should be stored at 20º to 25ºC (68º to 77ºF) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature] and protected from light.

A similar phenomenon has been observed in baboons but only after a protracted dosing period (6 months) at higher dose levels (335 mg/kg/day or more). The likelihood of this occurrence in humans is considered to be low, since Ceftriaxone has a greater plasma half-life in humans, the calcium salt of Ceftriaxone is more soluble in human gallbladder bile and the calcium content of human gallbladder bile is relatively low.</p><h2>How is Ceftriaxone Supplied</h2><p class="First">Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP is supplied as a sterile crystalline powder in glass vials. The following packages are available:</p><p>Vials containing Ceftriaxone sodium equivalent to 1 gm Ceftriaxone         Box of 25 (72572-061-25)</p><p>Vials containing Ceftriaxone sodium equivalent to 2 gm Ceftriaxone         Box of 25 (72572-062-25)</p><p>Note: Ceftriaxone for Injection, USP sterile powder should be stored at 20º to 25ºC (68º to 77ºF) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature], and protected from light.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients with Acute Bacterial Otitis Media: </span></span> In two adequate and well-controlled US clinical trials a single IM dose of Ceftriaxone was compared with a 10 day course of oral antibiotic in pediatric patients between the ages of 3 months and 6 years.
