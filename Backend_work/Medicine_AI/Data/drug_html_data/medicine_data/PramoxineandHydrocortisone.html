The treated area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive; however, occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. Discontinue the use of occlusive dressings if infection develops. The use of tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants should be avoided.</p><p>Foam: Epifoam: Shake vigorously for 5 to 10 seconds before each use. May apply directly to the affected are or alternatively, may dispense a small amount to a pad and apply to affected areas. Do not insert container into vagina or anus. Disassemble container and cap after each use and rinse with warm water.</p><p>Lotion: Shake well before use.</p><p>Rectal: Proctofoam HC: Shake vigorously for 5 to 10 seconds prior to use. Do not remove cap during use. Hold container upright to fill applicator. Gently insert applicator tip into anus. Only use applicator provided by manufacturer; do not insert any part of the aerosol container in the anus. Clean applicator after each use with warm water. For perianal application, transfer a small amount on to a tissue and gently rub into affected area.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).</p><p>EpiFoam and Proctofoam HC: Store upright at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). Do not refrigerate. Contents are under pressure; do not burn or puncture the container; do not store at temperatures above 49°C (120°F).</p><p>Pramcort: Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F), excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F). Brief exposure to temperatures up to 40°C (104°F) may be tolerated provided the mean kinetic temperature does not exceed 25°C (77°F); however, such exposure should be minimized. Protect from freezing.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Bupivacaine: Local Anesthetics may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bupivacaine.  Management: Avoid using any additional local anesthetics within 96 hours after insertion of the bupivacaine implant (Xaracoll).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Calcipotriene: Hydrocortisone (Topical) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Calcipotriene.  Management: Monitor for reduced calcipotriene efficacy if combined with hydrocortisone valerate. Consider separating the administration of these agents by 10 to 12 hours to minimize the risk of this potential interaction.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Methemoglobinemia Associated Agents: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Local Anesthetics. Specifically, the risk for methemoglobinemia may be increased.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>See individual agents.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.</p><p>• Contact dermatitis: May occur; discontinue use if irritation occurs and treat appropriately.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection; discontinue if dermatological infection persists despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, prolonged use, or application to large surface areas.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Because of the risk of adverse effects associated with systemic absorption, topical corticosteroids should be used cautiously in the elderly in the smallest possible effective dose for the shortest duration.</p><p>• Pediatric: Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Avoid use of topical preparations with occlusive dressings or on weeping or exudative lesions.</p><p>• Rectal foam: Do not insert any part of the aerosol container directly into the anus. Discontinue use if there is no evidence of clinical or proctologic improvement within 2 or 3 weeks after initiation of therapy or if the condition worsens.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>May consider the use of urinary free cortisol test and ACTH stimulation test in patients with suspected hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events have been observed with corticosteroids in animal reproduction studies. Rectal use of pramoxine and hydrocortisone for the treatment of hemorrhoids in the third trimester of pregnancy was not shown to affect birth weight (Ebrahimi 2011). Also refer to Hydrocortisone (Topical)  monograph.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat skin irritation.</p><p>• It is used to treat signs of hemorrhoids or rectal irritation.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
