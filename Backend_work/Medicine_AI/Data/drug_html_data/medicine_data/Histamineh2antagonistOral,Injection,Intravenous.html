</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Histamine H2-receptor antagonists, also known as H2-blockers, are used to treat duodenal ulcers and prevent their return. They are also used to treat gastric ulcers and for some conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison disease, in which the stomach produces too much acid. In over-the-counter (OTC) strengths, these medicines are used to relieve and/or prevent heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach. H2-blockers may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>H2-blockers work by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.</p><p>H2-blockers are available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor's prescription.</p><p>Limited testing has found unacceptable levels of a probable human carcinogen, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), in some ranitidine medicines.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>This medicine has been tested in children and, in effective doses, has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults when used for short periods of time.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Confusion and dizziness may be especially likely to occur in elderly patients, who are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of H2-blockers.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>H2-blockers have not been studied in pregnant women. In animal studies, famotidine and ranitidine have not been shown to cause birth defects or other problems. However, one study in rats suggested that cimetidine may affect male sexual development. More studies are needed to confirm this. Also, studies in rabbits with very high doses have shown that nizatidine causes miscarriages and low birth weights. Make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant before taking H2-blockers.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine pass into the breast milk and may cause unwanted effects, such as decreased amounts of stomach acid and increased excitement, in the nursing baby. It may be necessary for you to take another medicine or to stop breast-feeding during treatment. Be sure you have discussed the risks and benefits of the medicine with your doctor.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Kidney disease or</li>
<li>Liver disease—The H2-blocker may build up in the bloodstream, which may increase the risk of side effects.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Phenylketonuria (PKU)—Some H2-blockers contain aspartame. Aspartame is converted to phenylalanine in the body and must be used with caution in patients with PKU. The Pepcid AC brand of famotidine chewable tablets contains 1.4 mg of phenylalanine per 10-mg dose. The Pepcid RPD brand of famotidine oral dispersible tablets contains 1.05 mg of phenylalanine per 20-mg dose. The Zantac brand of ranitidine EFFERdose tablets contains 2.81 mg of phenylalanine per 25-mg dose and 16.84 mg of phenylalanine per 150-mg dose.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Porphyria (rare family disease that affects the way your body digests food)—May make condition worse in patients who have acute porphyria</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Weakened immune system (difficulty fighting infection)—Decrease in stomach acid caused by H2-blockers may increase the possibility of a certain type of infection</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p>For patients taking the nonprescription strengths of these medicines for heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach:</p><ul>
<li>Do not take the maximum daily dosage continuously for more than 2 weeks, unless directed to do so by your doctor.</li>
<li>If you have trouble in swallowing, or persistent abdominal pain, see your doctor promptly. These may be signs of a serious condition that may need different treatment.</li>
</ul><p>For patients taking the prescription strengths of these medicines for more serious problems:</p><ul>
<li>One dose a day—Take it at bedtime, unless otherwise directed.</li>
<li>Two doses a day—Take one in the morning and one at bedtime.</li>
<li>Several doses a day—Take them with meals and at bedtime for best results.</li>
</ul><p>It may take several days before this medicine begins to relieve stomach pain. To help relieve this pain, antacids may be taken with the H2-blocker, unless your doctor has told you not to use them. However, you should wait one-half to one hour between taking the antacid and the H2-blocker. Take this medicine for the full time of treatment, even if you begin to feel better. Also, it is important that you keep your appointments with your doctor for check-ups so that your doctor will be better able to tell you when to stop taking this medicine.</p><p>For patients taking famotidine chewable tablets:</p><ul>
<li>Chew the tablets well before swallowing.</li>
</ul><p>For patients taking famotidine oral disintegrating tablets:</p><ul>
<li>Make sure your hands are dry.</li>
<li>Leave tablets in unopened package until the time of use, then open the pack and remove the tablet.</li>
<li>Immediately place the tablet on the tongue.</li>
<li>The tablet will dissolve in seconds, and you may swallow it with your saliva. You do not need to drink water or other liquid to swallow the tablet.</li>
</ul><p>For patients taking ranitidine effervescent tablets:</p><ul>
<li>Do not chew, swallow whole or dissolve on the tongue.</li>
<li>Remove the foil wrapping and dissolve the 150-mg tablet in 6 to 8 ounces of water before drinking.</li>
<li>For infants and children: Dissolve the 25-mg tablet in no less than 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) of water in a dosing cup. Wait until the tablet is completely dissolved before administering the solution to the infant or child. You may give the medicine to your infant by dropper or oral syringe. Ask your doctor if you are unsure how much medicine to give your infant.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Tell the doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine before:</p><ul>
<li>You have any skin tests for allergies.</li>
<li>You have any tests to determine how much acid your stomach produces.</li>
</ul><p>Remember that certain medicines, such as aspirin, and certain foods and drinks (e.g., citrus products, carbonated drinks) irritate the stomach and may make your problem worse.</p><p>Cigarette smoking tends to decrease the effect of H2-blockers by increasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.
