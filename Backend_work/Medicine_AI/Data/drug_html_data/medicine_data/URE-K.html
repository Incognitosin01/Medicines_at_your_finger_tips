</ul><h2>URE-K 50% Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">URE-K 50%</span> cream is a potent keratolytic emollient which is a gentle, yet potent, tissue softener for skin and/or nails.</p><p>Each gram of <span class="Bold">URE-K 50%</span> cream contains:</p><p><span class="Bold">ACTIVE:</span> 50% Urea in a cream base of:</p><p><span class="Bold">INACTIVES:</span> Mineral Oil, Stearic Acid, Water, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Sepigel 305, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylate Copolymer and Vitamin E</p><h3>CHEMISTRY</h3><p class="First">Urea is a diamide of carbonic acid with the following chemical structure:</p><p></p><h2>URE-K 50% - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Urea gently dissolves the intercellular matrix which results in loosening the horny layer of skin and shedding scaly skin at regular intervals, thereby softening hyperkeratotic areas. Urea also hydrates and gently dissolves the intercellular matrix of the nail plate, which can result in the softening and eventual debridement of the nail plate.</p><h3>PHARMACOKINETICS</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of topically applied urea is not yet known.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for URE-K</h2><p class="First">For debridement and promotion of normal healing of hyperkeratotic surface lesions, particularly where healing is retarded by local infection, necrotic tissue, fibrinous or prurient debris or eschar. Urea is useful for the treatment of hyperkeratotic conditions such as dry, rough skin, dermatitis, psoriasis, xerosis, ichthyosis, eczema, keratosis, keratoderma, corns and calluses, as well as damaged, ingrown and devitalized nails.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">URE-K 50%</span> cream is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the listed ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">For external use only.

Stop use and ask a doctor if redness or irritation develops. If swallowed, get medical help or contact Poison Control Center right away. KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATION OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus, however, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, <span class="Bold">URE-K 50%</span> cream should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether or not this drug is secreted in human milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">URE-K 50%</span> cream is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Transient stinging, burning, itching or irritation may occur and normally disappear on discontinuing the medication.</p><h2>URE-K 50% - Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply <span class="Bold">URE-K 50%</span> cream to affected skin twice per day or as directed by a physician.
