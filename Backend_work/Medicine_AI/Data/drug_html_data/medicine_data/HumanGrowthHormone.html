Human growth hormone has been used to increase energy and improve mood, to increase lean body mass and muscle mass, and for its antiaging effects, although there is limited evidence to support these uses.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>Several capsules of various homeopathic formulations administered daily have helped improve energy and mood; however, data are lacking to provide specific dosing recommendations.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Hypersensitivity to any of the components of human growth hormone.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation are lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Dose-dependent adverse effects include fluid retention, carpal tunnel syndrome, and gynecomastia. Soft tissue edema has commonly occurred in women treated with human growth hormone and is not dose related. Increased concentrations of glucose and insulin have also been documented.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>No data.</p><h2>Source</h2><p>The biological source for active human growth hormone is human pituitary glands.1, 2</p><h2>History</h2><p>The first report of human growth hormone use for treatment of short stature or growth hormone deficiency was in 1958. Early growth hormone preparations were derived or extracted from human cadaver pituitaries for therapeutic use. The biochemical structure was determined in 1972. Production of some early preparations was discontinued due to the potential increased risk for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable, often fatal neurodegenerative condition. In 1985, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the commercial use of a recombinant human growth hormone product. Commercial preparations now have the identical 191 amino acid sequence of native human pituitary hormone.1, 2, 3 Human growth hormone injection is FDA-approved for long-term use in the treatment of children with growth failure. However, homeopathic formulations of human growth hormone have not been evaluated for this use.</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Human growth hormone is a single polypeptide chain of 191 amino acid residues and 2 disulfide bridges. Chemical dictionaries document the percentage composition as carbon 53.74%, hydrogen 6.96%, nitrogen 16.59%, oxygen 21.69%, and sulfur 1.01%.</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Published literature documents numerous animal and human studies evaluating use of human growth hormone, primarily for its metabolic benefits. Only select clinical trials will be evaluated due to the volume of available studies.</p><h3>Antiaging effects</h3><p>Aging is related to changes in overall body composition and metabolism, and to a reduction in growth hormone plasma levels. In a few short-term studies, age-related changes in body composition and metabolism were reversed or decreased by supplementation with human growth hormone.4, 5</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials of patients treated with human growth hormone, small changes in overall body composition and decreases in total cholesterol levels were observed. No changes in bone density and other serum lipid levels were reported. Due to an increased rate of adverse events, human growth hormone could not be recommended for antiaging purposes. Adverse events with human growth hormone included soft tissue edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, gynecomastia, onset of diabetes mellitus, and impaired fasting glucose.6</p><p>Somatopause is associated with age-related declines in human growth hormone production and secretion, growth hormone–binding protein, and insulinlike growth factor. Age-related changes are linked to these anabolic hormones. Additional, limited clinical studies are still investigating the antiaging benefits versus risks of human growth hormone supplementation.7</p><h3>Athletic performance</h3><p>Lean body tissue is thought to be preserved by human growth hormone supplementation. Professional athletes seeking improved performance and recovery from injury have used human growth hormone for its anabolic and lipolytic activity. In a meta-analysis of nearly 7,600 studies, 44 met inclusion criteria for evaluation of muscle performance outcomes. Overall, the results showed that athletic performance was not improved by human growth hormone supplementation. While the available limited evidence suggests that human growth hormone increases lean body tissue, it may not improve strength.8</p><p>A short-term study involving experienced weight lifters administered human growth hormone documented no increase in the rate of muscle protein synthesis and no reduction in body protein breakdown.9 Some studies suggest that human growth hormone supplementation may actually reduce exercise capacity,8 while others suggest that human growth hormone may improve energy supply (anaerobic performance) and thus enhance exercise capacity.8, 10, 11 Although increases in lean body mass have been observed following supplementation with human growth hormone, it is likely that fluid retention, rather than increased muscle mass, contributes to the increase.10 In one study, human growth hormone treatment resulted in statistically significant improvements in sprint capacity compared with placebo.11</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Several capsules of various homeopathic formulations administered daily have helped improve energy and mood; however, data are lacking to provide specific dosing recommendations.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Theoretically, glucocorticoids may interact with human growth hormone therapy and inhibit growth promotion. Some evidence exists regarding decreased clearance of sedative medications12 and increased clearance of pain medications.13</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>A number of adverse effects have been documented.14, 15 Dose-dependent adverse effects include fluid retention, carpal tunnel syndrome, and gynecomastia. Soft tissue edema has commonly occurred in women treated with human growth hormone and is not dose related. Fluid retention appears to be related to human growth hormone's action on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and spironolactone are effective in reversing the fluid retention. Increased concentrations of glucose and insulin concentrations have also been documented.4</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>No data. Caution is warranted with homeopathic products because many supplements contain ingredients to stimulate endogenous growth hormone production.</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
