Each syringe contains 3.6 grams of pyrantel base in 23.6 grams (20 mL) paste. Each mL contains 180 mg pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate.</p><h3>Composition</h3><p class="First">Pyrantel pamoate is a compound belonging to a family classified chemically as tetrahydropyrimidines. It is a yellow, water-insoluble crystalline salt of the tetrahydropyrimidine base and pamoic acid containing 34.7% base activity. The chemical structure and name are given below.</p><p>Chemical name: (E)-1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methyl-2-[2-(2-thienyl)-vinyl]-pyrimidine 4,4' methylenebis [3-hydroxy-2-naphtholate] (1:1)</p><h2>INDICATIONS FOR USE</h2><p class="First">For the removal and control of mature infections of large strongyles <span class="Italics">(Strongylus vulgaris, S. edentatus, S. equinus);</span> small strongyles; pinworms <span class="Italics">(Oxyuris equi);</span> and large roundworms <span class="Italics">(Parascaris equorum)</span> in horses and ponies.</p><p>Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitism.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND TREATMENT</h2><p class="First">Strongid Paste is to be administered as a single oral dose of 3 mg pyrantel base per lb of body weight. The syringe has 4 weight mark increments. Each weight mark indicates the recommended dose for 300 lb of body weight.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> Position screw-gauge over appropriate mark on plunger. Each mL contains 180 mg of pyrantel base as pyrantel pamoate.</p><p>For maximum control of parasitism, it is recommended that foals (2–8 months of age) be dosed every 4 weeks. To minimize the potential source of infection that the mare may pose to the foal, the mare should be treated 1 month prior to anticipated foaling date followed by retreatment 10 days to 2 weeks after birth of foal. Horses and ponies over 8 months of age should be routinely dosed every 6 weeks.</p><h2>ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">After removing the cap, the paste should be deposited on the dorsum of the tongue. Introduce the nozzle end of the syringe at the corner of the mouth. Direct the syringe backwards and depress the plunger to deposit the paste onto the tongue. Given in this manner, it is unlikely that rejection of the paste will occur. Raising the horse's head sometimes assists in the swallowing process. When only part of the paste has been used, replace the cap on the syringe nozzle.</p><h2>EFFICACY</h2><p class="First">Critical (worm count) studies in horses demonstrated that Strongid Paste administered at the recommended dosage was efficacious against mature infections of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span> (&gt;90%), <span class="Italics">S. edentatus</span> (69%), <span class="Italics">S. equinus</span> (&gt;90%), <span class="Italics">Oxyuris equi</span> (81%), <span class="Italics">Parascaris equorum</span> (&gt;90%), and small strongyles (&gt;90%).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Keep out of reach of children.</p><p>It is recommended that severely debilitated animals not be treated with this preparation.</p><h2>RECOMMENDED STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature 15°–25°C (59°–77°F).</p><p class="First">NADA #129-831, Approved by FDA</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Distributed by:</span><br/>
