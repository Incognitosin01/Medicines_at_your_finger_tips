Hemin works by lowering the production of a certain enzyme in the body.</p><p>Hemin is used to treat the symptoms of occasional attacks of porphyria related to the menstrual cycle in women. Hemin helps control symptoms such as pain, increased heart rate or blood pressure, and changes in mental status.</p><p>Hemin should not be used to treat porphyria that affects the skin, also called porphyria cutanea tarda.</p><p>Hemin is not a cure for porphyria. It will only control the symptoms of a porphyria episode.</p><p>Hemin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.

Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of it containing infectious agents, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication.</p><p>It is not known whether  hemin will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>It is not known whether hemin passes into breast milk or if it could affect a nursing baby.

Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Using too much hemin could harm your kidneys.</p><p>Hemin is injected into a vein through an IV. You may be shown how to use an IV at home. Do not give yourself this medicine if you do not understand how to use the injection and properly dispose of needles, IV tubing, and other items used.</p><p>For best results, <b>start using hemin at the first sign of a porphyria attack.</b></p><p>You may need to use hemin once or twice per day for up to 2 weeks, depending on how your body responds to the medicine.</p><p>Hemin is a powder medicine that must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it.
