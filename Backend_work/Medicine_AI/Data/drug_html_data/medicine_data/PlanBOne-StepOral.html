It works by preventing a woman's egg from fully developing. It may also prevent the attachment of the woman's egg to the wall of the uterus (womb).</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective. <i>This medicine should not be used as a regular method of birth control</i>. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.</p><p><i>Plan B One-Step®</i> is available as an over-the-counter medicine for any woman of childbearing potential.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Plan B One-Step</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
