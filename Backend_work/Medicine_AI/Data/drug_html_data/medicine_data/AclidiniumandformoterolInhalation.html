It will not relieve a COPD attack that has already started or an asthma attack.</p><p>Inhaled aclidinium and formoterol are long-acting bronchodilators. These are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>Aclidinium and formoterol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using aclidinium and formoterol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For aclidinium and formoterol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to aclidinium and formoterol or any other medicines.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of aclidinium and formoterol combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of aclidinium and formoterol than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of aclidinium and formoterol</h2><p>Inhaled aclidinium and formoterol combination is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve a COPD attack that has already started. For relief of an COPD attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p><i>Use aclidinium and formoterol only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using aclidinium and formoterol without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>Aclidinium and formoterol is used with a special inhaler that comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using the medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.</p><p>Use aclidinium and formoterol at the same time each day.</p><p>Do not stop using aclidinium and formoterol or other breathing medicines that your doctor has prescribed for you unless you have discussed this with your doctor.</p><p>To use the inhaler:</p><ul>
<li>Aclidinium and formoterol comes in a sealed bag. Do not open the bag until you are ready to use the inhaler. Do not press the orange button until you are ready to take a dose.</li>
<li>Remove the cap by squeezing and pulling it off the mouthpiece. Check the mouthpiece to make sure it is clear.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece facing you and the orange button is on top. Press the orange button all the way down and release it. Do not tilt the inhaler.</li>
<li>Check the control window to make sure your dose is ready for inhalation. Look if the colored control window changed from red to green. If it is still red, repeat the steps to prepare your dose.</li>
<li>To inhale aclidinium and formoterol, breathe out fully and try to get as much air out of your lungs as possible. Put your lips tightly around the mouthpiece and breathe in quickly and deeply until you hear a "click" sound. Keep breathing in, even after you hear the "click" sound to be sure you get the full dose. Do not hold the orange button while you are breathing in.</li>
<li>Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for as long as is comfortable, and then breathe out slowly through your nose. You may have a grainy feeling or a slightly sweet or bitter taste in your mouth after inhalation. Do not take an extra dose if you do not taste or feel anything after inhaling.</li>
<li>Check the colored control window if it has turned to red. This means you have inhaled the full dose of aclidinium and formoterol. If it is still colored green, repeat the steps above. If you are unable to inhale correctly after several attempts, call your doctor.</li>
<li>Once the window has turned red, place the cap back by pressing it back into the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>To clean the inhaler, wipe the mouthpiece with a dry tissue or towel. Do not use water to clean it, as this may damage the medicine.</li>
<li>The inhaler has a window that shows the number of doses that are left. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. A red band will appear in the window to remind you to refill your prescription.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of aclidinium and formoterol will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of aclidinium and formoterol. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
