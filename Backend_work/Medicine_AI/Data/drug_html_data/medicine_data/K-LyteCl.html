Potassium levels can be low as a result of a disease or from taking certain medicines, or after a prolonged illness with diarrhea or vomiting.</p><p>K-Lyte/Cl may also be used for other purposes other than those listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use this medication if you have kidney failure, Addison's disease, severe burns or other tissue injury, if you are dehydrated, if you take certain diuretics (water pills), or if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia).</p><p>Do not chew the effervescent tablet or swallow it whole.
