Tuberculin test may be given prior to vaccination, simultaneously at separate sites on the same day as measles-containing vaccine, or 4 to 6 weeks later (CDC/ACIP [McLean 2013]).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Syncope, vasculitis</p><p>Central nervous system: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, ataxia, dizziness, Guillain-Barré syndrome, headache, irritability, malaise, paresthesia, polyneuropathy, retrobulbar neuritis, seizure, sensorineural hearing loss, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, transverse myelitis</p><p>Dermatologic: Erythema multiforme, IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schnolein purpura/acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy), morbilliform rash, pruritus, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Diabetes mellitus</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, pancreatitis, parotitis, sore throat, vomiting</p><p>Genitourinary: Epididymitis, orchitis</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Leukocytosis, lymphadenopathy (regional), purpura, thrombocytopenia</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema</p><p>Infection: Atypical measles</p><p>Local: Injection site reaction (including burning, induration, redness, stinging, swelling, tenderness, vesiculation, wheal and flare)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Arthropathy (arthralgia/arthritis: Women 12% to 26%; children ≤3%), myalgia, panniculitis</p><p>Ophthalmic: Conjunctivitis, oculomotor nerve paralysis, optic neuritis, optic papillitis, retinitis</p><p>Otic: Otitis media</p><p>Respiratory: Bronchospasm, cough, pneumonia, rhinitis</p><p>Miscellaneous: Febrile seizures, fever</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Aseptic meningitis (associated with Urabe strain of mumps vaccine), brain disease, encephalitis</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available during vaccine use (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Febrile seizures: Febrile seizures have been reported within 2 weeks following immunization with MMR vaccine; risk is increased in those who experienced previous febrile seizure from any cause and those with family history of febrile seizures.</p><p>• Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration: Vaccine administration that is too high on the upper arm may cause shoulder injury (eg, shoulder bursitis, tendinopathy) resulting in shoulder pain and reduced range of motion following injection. Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever). Although fever is a contraindication per the manufacturer, current guidelines allow for administration to patients with mild acute illness (without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; CDC/ACIP [McLean 2013]).</p><p>• CNS disorders: Use with caution in patients with history of cerebral injury, seizures, or other conditions where stress due to fever should be avoided.</p><p>• Measles exposure: Exposure to measles is not a contraindication to vaccine; use within 72 hours of exposure may provide some protection.</p><p>• Mumps exposure: Postexposure vaccination has not been shown to prevent or alter disease following mumps exposure (CDC/ACIP [McLean 2013]).</p><p>• Rubella exposure: Postexposure vaccination has not been shown to prevent or alter disease following rubella exposure (CDC/ACIP [McLean 2013]).</p><p>• Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia (transient) has been reported 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination; use with caution in patients with thrombocytopenia and those who developed thrombocytopenia after a previous dose.</p><p>• Tuberculosis: Defer vaccination in patients with active untreated tuberculosis.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Immune globulins: Recent administration of immune globulins may interfere with immune response. Guidelines with suggested administration intervals are available (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. The use of combination vaccines is generally preferred over separate injections, taking into consideration provider assessment, patient preference, and potential adverse events. When using combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest minimum age for any individual component; the minimum interval between dosing is the greatest minimum interval between any individual components. The ACIP prefers each dose of a specific vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer when possible (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Use is contraindicated in severely immunocompromised patients. The ACIP does not recommend vaccination for persons with primary or acquired immunodeficiency (including immunosuppression associated with cellular immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, dysgammaglobulinemia and AIDs, or severe immunosuppression associated with HIV); persons with blood dyscrasia, leukemia, lymphoma, or other malignant neoplasms which affect the bone marrow or lymphatic system; persons with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency in first degree relatives (unless immunocompetence can be established); persons taking systemic corticosteroid therapy for ≥2 weeks in doses of corticosteroids ≥2 mg/kg of body weight or prednisone (or equivalent) ≥20 mg/day for persons who weigh &gt;10 kg. Patients with HIV infection, who are asymptomatic and not severely immunosuppressed may be vaccinated (severe immunosuppression is defined as CD4+ T-lymphocyte &lt;15% at any age or CD4 count &lt;200 lymphocytes/mm<sup>3</sup> for persons &gt;5 years) (CDC/ACIP [McLean 2013]). Patients with leukemia who are in remission and who have not received chemotherapy for at least 3 months may be vaccinated. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Pediatric: Safety and efficacy of measles vaccine has not been established in children &lt;6 months of age and safety and efficacy of mumps and rubella vaccines have not been established in &lt;12 months of age. Local health departments may recommend vaccine to children 6 to 12 months of age in outbreak situations, but this would not count towards their immunization series.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Albumin: Some dosage forms may contain human albumin.</p><p>• Egg allergy: Vaccine may contain trace amounts of chick embryo antigen. Use caution in patients with history of immediate hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions following egg ingestion. Generally, the MMR vaccine can be safely administered to persons with an egg allergy (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Gelatin: Products may contain gelatin. Use is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction to gelatin</p><p>• Neomycin sensitivity: Manufactured with neomycin. Use is contraindicated in patients with history of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions to neomycin. Contact dermatitis due to neomycin is not a contraindication to the vaccine.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions: </i></b></p><p>• Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen prior to vaccination to prevent fever decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).</p><p>• Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information). Specific recommendations for vaccination in immunocompromised patients with asplenia, cancer, HIV infection, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, cochlear implants, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (prior to or after), sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant (prior to or after), or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy for chronic conditions as well as contacts of immunocompromised patients are available from the IDSA (Rubin 2014).</p><p>• Blood products: Recent administration of blood or blood products may interfere with immune response. Guidelines with suggested administration intervals are available (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>This vaccine should not be administered to women who plan to become pregnant within 1 month of immunization.</p><p>Prenatal screening is recommended for all pregnant women who lack evidence of rubella immunity. Women of childbearing age without documentation of rubella vaccination or serologic evidence of immunity should be vaccinated (for women of childbearing potential, birth prior to 1957 is not acceptable evidence of immunity to rubella).</p><p>Sterility in males and infertility in prepubescent females may occur with natural mumps infection (CDC/ACIP [McLean 2013]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on information collected following inadvertent administration during pregnancy, adverse events have not been observed following use of rubella vaccine. However, theoretical risks cannot be ruled out; use of this vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant females. The risk of congenital rubella syndrome following vaccination is significantly less than the risk associated following infection; therefore, inadvertent administration of MMR during pregnancy is not considered an indication to terminate pregnancy.</p><p>Adverse consequences of natural infection in unvaccinated pregnant women have been reported. Measles infection during pregnancy may increase the risk of premature labor, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion and low birth weights. Rubella infection during the first trimester may lead to miscarriages, stillbirths, and congenital rubella syndrome (includes auditory, ophthalmic, cardiac and neurologic defects; intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation); fetal rubella infection can occur during any trimester of pregnancy. Maternal mumps infection during the first trimester may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion or intrauterine fetal death.</p><p>Prenatal screening is recommended for all pregnant women who lack evidence of rubella immunity.
