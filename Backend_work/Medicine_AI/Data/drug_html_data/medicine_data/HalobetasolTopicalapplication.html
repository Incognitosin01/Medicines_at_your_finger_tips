It is also used to treat plaque psoriasis. Halobetasol is a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine or steroid).</p><p>Halobetasol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using halobetasol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For halobetasol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to halobetasol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of halobetasol topical <i>cream</i>, <i>ointment</i>, or <i>lotion</i> in children 12 years of age and older. However, because of halobetasol's toxicity, it should be used with caution. Children may absorb large amounts through the skin, which can cause serious side effects. If your child is using halobetasol, follow your doctor's instructions very carefully. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 12 years of age and use is not recommended.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of halobetasol topical <i>foam</i> in the pediatric population.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of halobetasol.
