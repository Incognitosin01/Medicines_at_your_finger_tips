Acyclovir will not cure herpes, but it can lessen the symptoms of the infection.</p><p>Acyclovir injection is used to treat severe infections caused by herpes viruses, including severe forms of genital herpes, shingles, herpes encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and herpes infections in people with other diseases that weaken the immune system.</p><p>Acyclovir may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package. Tell each of your healthcare providers about all your medical conditions, allergies, and all medicines you use.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medication if you are allergic to acyclovir or valacyclovir (Valtrex).</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liver disease;</p>

</ul><p>kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis);</p><p>liver disease;</p><p>breathing problems; or</p><p>an electrolyte imbalance (such as high or low levels of calcium, sodium, or potassium in your blood).</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. <b>Herpes can be passed to your baby during childbirth if you have a genital lesion when your baby is born.</b> If you have genital herpes, it is very important to prevent herpes lesions during pregnancy. Use your medicine as directed to best control your infection.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using  acyclovir. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use acyclovir injection?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Treatment with acyclovir should be started as soon as possible after the first appearance of symptoms (such as tingling, burning, blisters).</p><p>Acyclovir is given as an infusion into a vein, usually once every 8 hours. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>This medicine must be given slowly, and the infusion can take at least 1 hour to complete.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Acyclovir must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. When using injections by yourself, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine. Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Mixed medicine must be used within 24 hours.</p><p>Drink plenty of liquids while you are using acyclovir to keep your kidneys working properly.</p><p>You may need to use acyclovir injection for up to 21 days. Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve. Skipping doses may increase the risk of your virus becoming resistant to medication.</p><p>Lesions caused by herpes viruses should be kept as clean and dry as possible. Wearing loose clothing may help to prevent irritation of the lesions.</p><p>Store acyclovir injection at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include agitation, seizure, decreased energy, or coma.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using acyclovir injection?</h2><p>Herpes infections are contagious and you can infect other people, even while you are being treated with acyclovir. Avoid letting infected areas come into contact with other people. Avoid touching an infected area and then touching your eyes. Wash your hands frequently to prevent passing the infection to others.</p><p><b>Using  acyclovir will not prevent you from passing genital herpes to your sexual partner.</b> Avoid sexual intercourse while you have active lesions or the first symptoms of an outbreak.
