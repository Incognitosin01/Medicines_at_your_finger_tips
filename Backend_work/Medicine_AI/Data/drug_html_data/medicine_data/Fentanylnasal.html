Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p><b>Do not breastfeed.</b> Fentanyl can cause drowsiness, breathing problems, or withdrawal symptoms in a nursing infant.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use fentanyl nasal?</h2><p>Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use fentanyl in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to take more of  fentanyl.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.</p><p>Never use fentanyl nasal together with a second form of fentanyl or to replace any other form of fentanyl (injection, skin patch, dissolving film, or "lollipop" device).</p><p>If you switch to fentanyl nasal from another form of fentanyl, you will not use the same dose. You must start with the lowest dose.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Call your doctor if you still have pain more than 30 minutes after using the nasal spray, or if you have breakthrough pain more than 4 times in one day.</p><p>You must wait at least 2 hours after your last dose of fentanyl nasal before you can treat a new pain episode.</p><p>Do not stop using fentanyl suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.

Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A fentanyl overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, weak pulse, fainting, and slow breathing (breathing may stop).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking fentanyl nasal?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how  fentanyl will affect you.

Avoid the use of grapefruit products.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Fentanyl nasal side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Opioid medicine can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur.
