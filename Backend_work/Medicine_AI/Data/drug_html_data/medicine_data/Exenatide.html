Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Never share an injection pen or syringe with another person, even if the needle has been changed.

You may need frequent medical tests while using this medicine and for a short time after you stop.</p><p>Byetta is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care.
