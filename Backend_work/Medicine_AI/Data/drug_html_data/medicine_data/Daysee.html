</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptives (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. [</span>See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Daysee</h2><p class="First">Daysee<span class="Sup">TM</span> (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP, and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) is indicated for use by women to prevent pregnancy.</p><h2>Daysee Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Take one tablet by mouth at the same time every day. The dosage of Daysee is one light blue tablet containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol daily for 84 consecutive days, followed by one mustard ethinyl estradiol tablet for 7 days. To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Daysee must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.</p><p>Instruct the patient to begin taking Daysee on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation. If menstruation begins on a Sunday, the first light blue tablet is taken that day. One light blue tablet should be taken daily for 84 consecutive days, followed by one mustard tablet for 7 consecutive days. A non-hormonal back-up method of contraception (such as condoms or spermicide) should be used until a light blue tablet has been taken daily for 7 consecutive days. A scheduled period should occur during the 7 days that the mustard tablets are taken.</p><p class="First">Begin the next and all subsequent 91-day cycles without interruption on the same day of the week (Sunday) on which the patient began her first dose of Daysee, following the same schedule: 84 days taking a light blue tablet followed by 7 days taking a mustard tablet. If the patient does not immediately start her next pill pack, she should protect herself from pregnancy by using a non-hormonal back-up method of contraception until she has taken a light blue tablet daily for 7 consecutive days. If unscheduled spotting or bleeding occurs, instruct the patient to continue on the same regimen. If the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, advise the patient to consult her healthcare provider.</p><p>For patient instructions regarding missed pills, see <span class="Bold">FDA-Approved Patient Labeling</span>.</p><p>For postpartum women who are not breastfeeding, start Daysee no earlier than four to six weeks postpartum due to increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts on Daysee postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken a light blue tablet for 7 consecutive days.   </p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Daysee is available in Extended-Cycle Wallet, each containing a 13-week supply of tablets: 84 light blue tablets, each containing 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol, and 7 mustard tablets each containing 0.01 mg of ethinyl estradiol. The light blue tablets are round, biconvex film-coated tablets, debossed with "LU" on one side and "V21" on the other side. The mustard tablets are round, biconvex film-coated tablets debossed with "LU" on one side and "V22" on the other side.   </p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not prescribe Daysee to women who are known to have the following:</p><ul>

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thrombotic and Other Vascular Events</h3><p class="First">Stop Daysee if an arterial or deep venous thrombotic event occurs. Although the use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of venous thromboembolism in women using COCs is 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The excess risk is highest during the first year of use of a COC. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.</p><p>Use of Daysee provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly oral contraceptives containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 and 13 weeks of exposure to progestin and estrogen, respectively, per year).</p><p>If feasible, stop Daysee at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.</p><p>Start Daysee no earlier than 4 to 6 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</p><p>COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), and hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.</p><p>Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p><p>Stop Daysee if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.</p><h3>Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix</h3><p class="First">Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Daysee because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><p>Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First">Discontinue Daysee if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.</p><p>Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><p>Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use.</p><h3>5.4 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First"> <span class="following_xmChange">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains obmitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Daysee prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)</span>]. Daysee can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</span></p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Daysee if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Daysee. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Daysee develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Daysee if indicated.</p><p>An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities</h3><p class="First">Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If bleeding persists, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.</p><p>When prescribing Daysee, the convenience of fewer planned menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) should be weighed against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting. The primary clinical trial (PSE-301) that evaluated the efficacy of Daysee also assessed unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the 12-month clinical trial (N=1,006) completed the equivalent of 8,681 28-day cycles of exposure and were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously (89%) as opposed to new users (11%). A total of 82 (8.2%) of the women discontinued Daysee, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting.</p><p>Scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding and/or spotting remained fairly constant over time, with an average of 3 days of bleeding and/or spotting per each 91-day cycle. Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 1 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding in treatment cycles 1 and 4. Table 2 presents the number of days with unscheduled spotting in treatment cycles 1 and 4.</p><p>Q1 = Quartile 1: 25% of women had this number of days of unscheduled bleeding</p><p>Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding</p><p>Q3 = Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding</p><p>Q1 = Quartile 1: 25% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting</p><p>Median: 50% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting</p><p>Q3 = Quartile 3: 75% of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled spotting</p><p>Figure 1 shows the percentage of Daysee subjects participating in trial PSE-301 with ≥ 7 days or ≥ 20 days of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, or only unscheduled bleeding, during each 91-day treatment cycle.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Percent of Women Taking Daysee who Reported Unscheduled Bleeding and/or Spotting or only Unscheduled Bleeding</span></p><p>Amenorrhea sometimes occurs in women who are using COCs. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see <span class="Bold">USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Emotional Disorders</h3><p class="First">Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Daysee discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid binding globulin increase with use of COCs.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care.</p><h3>Other Conditions</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs.     </p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Serious cardiovascular events and smoking [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</li>
<li>Vascular events [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Liver disease [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]</li>
</ul><p class="First">Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:</p><ul>
<li>Irregular uterine bleeding</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Breast tenderness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Daysee was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18 to 40, of whom 1,006 took at least one dose of Daysee.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation</span></span></p><p>16.3% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (≥ 1% of women) leading to discontinuation were irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (5.9%), weight gain (2.4%), mood changes (1.5%), and acne (1.0%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions (≥ 5% of women)</span></span></p><p>Irregular and/or heavy uterine bleeding (17%), weight gain (5%), acne (5%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Serious Adverse Reactions</span></span></p><p>Migraine, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and major depressive disorder.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Daysee. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency of establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders</span></span></p><p>Abdominal distension, vomiting</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions</span></span></p><p>Chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Immune system Disorders</span></span></p><p>Hypersensitivity reaction</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Investigations</span></span></p><p>Blood pressure increased</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders</span></span></p><p>Muscle spasms, pain in extremity</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders</span></span></p><p>Dizziness, loss of consciousness</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders</span></span></p><p>Insomnia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reproductive and Breast Disorders</span></span></p><p>Dysmenorrhea</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders</span></span></p><p>Pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders</span></span></p><p>Alopecia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Vascular Disorders</span></span></p><p>Thrombosis  </p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Daysee.</p><h3>Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products</h3><p class="First">If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include:</p><ul>
<li>barbiturates</li>
<li>bosentan</li>
<li>carbamazepine</li>
<li>felbamate</li>
<li>griseofulvin</li>
<li>oxcarbazepine</li>
<li>phenytoin</li>
<li>rifampin</li>
<li>St. John's wort</li>
<li>topiramate</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">HIV Protease Inhibitors and Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Antibiotics</span></span></p><p>There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids.</p><p>Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.</p><h3>Increase in Plasma Levels of Estradiol Associated with Co-Administered Drugs</h3><p class="First">Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with Hepatitis C Vaccine (HCV) Combination Therapy -Liver Enzyme Elevation</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer Daysee with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)</span>].</p><h3>Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs</h3><p class="First">COCs containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. COCs have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for enzyme alterations.    </p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>The administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. COCs should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><p>Women who do not breastfeed may start COCs no earlier than four to six weeks postpartum.        </p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">When possible, advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception until she has weaned her child. Estrogen-containing COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Daysee have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 as for users 18 years and older. Use of Daysee before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Daysee has not been studied in women who have reached menopause and is not indicated in this population.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Daysee. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal. [See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) </span>and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal disease on the disposition of Daysee.     </p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose of oral contraceptives, including ingestion by children. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea.  </p><h2>Daysee Description</h2><p class="First">Daysee (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP, and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP) is an extended-cycle oral contraceptive consisting of 84 light blue tablets each containing 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel, a synthetic progestogen and 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol, and 7 mustard tablets containing 0.01 mg of ethinyl estradiol.</p><p>The structural formulas for the active components are:</p><p>Levonorgestrel is chemically 18,19-Dinorpregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one, 13-ethyl-17-hydroxy-,(17α)-, (-)-.</p><p>Ethinyl Estradiol is 19-Norpregna-1, 3, 5 (10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol, (17α)-</p><p>Each light blue tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, FD and C blue No. 1, FD and C yellow No. 6, iron oxide yellow, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, povidone and titanium dioxide.</p><p>Each mustard tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: FD and C yellow No. 6, hypromellose, iron oxide yellow, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polacrillin potassium, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80 and titanium dioxide.</p><p>The Mustard Tablet <span class="Italics">i.e.</span> Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets USP meets USP Dissolution Test 2.       </p><h2>Daysee - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.    </p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel are absorbed with maximum plasma concentrations occurring within 2 hours after Daysee administration. Levonorgestrel is completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability nearly 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. Ethinyl estradiol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is approximately 43%.</p><p>The daily exposures to levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol on Day 21, corresponding to the end of a typical 3-week contraceptive regimen, and on Day 84, at the end of an extended cycle regimen, were similar. There was no additional accumulation of ethinyl estradiol after dosing a 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol tablet during Days 84 to 91. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of Daysee following a single dose of one levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol combination tablet, for 84 days, in normal healthy women are reported in Table 3.</p><p>The effect of food on the rate and the extent of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol absorption following oral administration of Daysee has not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol are reported to be approximately 1.8 L/kg and 4.3 L/kg, respectively. Levonorgestrel is about 97.5 to 99% protein-bound, principally to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and, to a lesser extent, serum albumin. Ethinyl estradiol is about 95 to 97% bound to serum albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis, which leads to decreased levonorgestrel clearance. Following repeated daily dosing of levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel plasma concentrations accumulate more than predicted based on single-dose pharmacokinetics, due in part, to increased SHBG levels that are induced by ethinyl estradiol, and a possible reduction in hepatic metabolic capacity.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></span></p><p>Following absorption, levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17β-OH position to form sulfate and to a lesser extent, glucuronide conjugates in plasma. Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3α, 5β-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma, along with much smaller amounts of 3α, 5α -tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16β-hydroxylevonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users.</p><p>First-pass metabolism of ethinyl estradiol involves formation of ethinyl estradiol-3-sulfate in the gut wall, followed by 2-hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed ethinyl estradiol by hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of ethinyl estradiol hydroxylation.</p><p>Hydroxylation at the 4-, 6-, and 16- positions may also occur, although to a much lesser extent than 2-hydroxylation.

The racial demographic of those enrolled was: Caucasian (80%), African-American (11%), Hispanic (5%), Asian (2%), and Other (2%). There were no exclusions for body mass index (BMI) or weight. The weight range of those women treated was 91 to 360 lbs., with a mean weight of 156 lbs. Among the women in the trial, 63% were current or recent hormonal contraceptive users, 26% were prior users (who had used hormonal contraceptives in the past but not in the 6 months prior to enrollment), and 11% were new starts. Of treated women, 14.8% were lost to follow-up, 16.3% discontinued due to an adverse event, and 12.9% discontinued by withdrawing their consent.</p><p>The pregnancy rate (Pearl Index [PI]) in women aged 18 to 35 years was 1.34 pregnancies per 100 women-years of use (95% confidence interval 0.54 to 2.75), based on 7 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 14 days after the last combination pill. Cycles in which conception did not occur, but which included the use of back-up contraception, were not included in the calculation of the PI. The PI includes patients who did not take the drug correctly.     </p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Daysee [levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP (0.15 mg/0.03 mg) and ethinyl estradiol tablets USP (0.01 mg)] is available in Extended-Cycle Wallets each containing a 13-week supply of tablets: 84 light blue tablets, each containing 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel and 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol, and 7 mustard tablets each containing 0.01 mg of ethinyl estradiol.

However, birth control pills taken by accident during pregnancy are not known to cause birth defects.</p><p>If you are breastfeeding, consider another birth control method until you are ready to stop breastfeeding. Birth control pills that contain estrogen, like Daysee, may decrease the amount of milk you make. A small amount of the pill's hormones pass into breast milk.</p><p>Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines and herbal products that you take. Some medicines and herbal products may make birth control pills less effective, including:</p><ul>
<li>barbiturates</li>
<li>bosentan</li>
<li>carbamazepine</li>
<li>felbamate</li>
<li>griseofulvin</li>

<li>phenytoin</li>
<li>rifampin</li>
<li>St. John's wort</li>
<li>topiramate</li>
</ul><p>Consider using another birth control method when you take medicines that may make birth control pills less effective.</p><p>Birth control pills may interact with lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant used for epilepsy. This may increase the risk of seizures, so your physician may need to adjust the dose of lamotrigine.</p><p>If you have vomiting or diarrhea, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use another birth control method, like condoms or a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">What Are The Most Serious Risks of Taking Birth Control Pills?</span></p><p>Like pregnancy, birth control pills increase the risk of serious blood clots, especially in women who have other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or age &gt; 35. It is possible to die from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as a heart attack or a stroke. Some examples of serious blood clots are blood clots in the:</p><ul>
<li>Legs (thrombophlebitis)</li>
<li>Lungs (pulmonary embolus)</li>
<li>Eyes (loss of eyesight)</li>
<li>Heart (heart attack)</li>
<li>Brain (stroke)</li>
</ul><p>Women who take birth control pills may get:</p><ul>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Gallbladder problems</li>
<li>Rare cancerous or noncancerous liver tumors</li>
</ul><p>All of these events are uncommon in healthy women.</p><p>Call your healthcare provider right away if you have:</p><ul>
<li>Persistent leg pain</li>
<li>Sudden shortness of breath</li>
<li>Sudden blindness, partial or complete</li>
<li>Severe pain in your chest</li>

<li>Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Breast tenderness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
</ul><p>These side effects are usually mild and usually disappear with time.</p><p>Less common side effects are:</p><ul>
<li>Acne</li>
<li>Less sexual desire</li>
<li>Bloating or fluid retention</li>
<li>Blotchy darkening of the skin, especially on the face</li>

You may also report side effects to Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561.</p><p>No serious problems have been reported from a birth control pill overdose, even when accidentally taken by children.</p><p><span class="Bold">Do Birth Control Pills Cause Cancer?</span></p><p>Birth control pills do not appear to cause breast cancer. However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.</p><p>Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.</p><p><span class="Bold">What Should I Know About My Period When Taking Daysee?</span></p><p>When you take Daysee, which has a 91-day extended dosing cycle, you should expect to have 4 scheduled periods per year (bleeding when you are taking the 7 mustard pills). Each period is likely to last about 3 days. However, you will probably have more bleeding or spotting between your scheduled periods than if you were using a birth control pill with a 28-day dosing cycle. During the first Daysee 91-day treatment cycle, about 3 in 10 women may have 20 or more days of unplanned bleeding or spotting. This bleeding or spotting tends to decrease with time. Do not stop taking Daysee because of this bleeding or spotting. If the spotting continues for more than 7 consecutive days or if the bleeding is heavy, call your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">What If I Miss My Scheduled Period When Taking Daysee?</span></p><p>You should consider the possibility that you are pregnant if you miss your scheduled period (no bleeding on the days that you are taking mustard tablets). Since scheduled periods are less frequent when you are taking Daysee, notify your healthcare provider that you have missed your period and that you are taking Daysee. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. It is important that your healthcare provider evaluates you to determine if you are pregnant. Stop taking Daysee if it is determined that you are pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold">What If I Want To Become Pregnant?</span></p><p>You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill.</p><p><span class="Bold">General Advice About Daysee</span></p><p>Your healthcare provider prescribed Daysee for you. Do not share Daysee with anyone else. Keep Daysee out of the reach of children.</p><p>If you have concerns or questions, ask your healthcare provider.
