However, regular treatment with ICS has been shown to increase the risk of pneumonia, especially in those with severe disease. Combination therapy is recommended in patients with a history of hospitalization(s) for exacerbations of COPD, ≥2 moderate exacerbations of COPD per year, blood eosinophils &gt;300 cells/microliter, and concomitant or history of asthma.

After symptoms stabilize or after a maximum of 14 days of quadrupled dose, whichever occurs first, patients should be returned to their baseline dose (GINA 2019). Quadrupling the inhaled corticosteroid dose has been shown to decrease the severity of an asthma exacerbation in select patients. In a randomized trial of adolescents ≥16 years and adults (n=1,871), temporarily quadrupling the inhaled corticosteroid dose when asthma control began to deteriorate resulted in fewer severe asthma exacerbations (ie, less treatment with systemic glucocorticoids or unscheduled appointments for asthma) compared to patients who maintained their inhaled corticosteroid dose (McKeever 2018). No data for quadrupling the dose in patients &lt;16 years of age has been published. Quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) in children 5 to 11 years of age was not shown to reduce the rate of severe exacerbations and may have been associated with adverse effects (decreased linear growth, particularly in patients &lt;8 years of age) (GINA 2019; Jackson 2018).</p><p><b>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), treatment</b>: Limited data available: Infants: Fluticasone propionate: Oral inhalation: Some centers have used 2 to 4 puffs (44 mcg/puff) every 12 hours via a face mask and a spacer.

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving ≥20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do <b>not</b> provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, infections (particularly gastroenteritis), or other conditions with severe electrolyte loss. Select surgical patients on long-term, high-dose, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should be given stress doses of hydrocortisone IV during the surgical period and the dose reduced rapidly within 24 hours after surgery (NAEPP 2007).</p><p>• Bronchospasm: Paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening may occur with use of inhaled bronchodilating agents; reaction should be distinguished from inadequate response. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue fluticasone and institute alternative therapy.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, rash, urticaria), including anaphylaxis, may occur.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Avoid use if possible in patients with ocular herpes; active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; or viral, fungal, or bacterial or parasitic systemic infections. Exposure to chickenpox and measles should be avoided; if the patient is exposed, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin or pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin, respectively, may be indicated; if chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>• Oral candidiasis: Local oropharyngeal <i>Candida</i> infections have been reported; if this occurs, treat appropriately while continuing therapy. Patients should be instructed to rinse mouth with water without swallowing after each use.</p><p>• Vasculitis: Rare cases of vasculitis (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Churg-Strauss]) or other systemic eosinophilic conditions can occur; often associated with decrease and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following initiation of inhaled corticosteroid.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Appropriate use: Supplemental steroids (oral or parenteral) may be needed during stress or severe asthma attacks. Use is contraindicated in status asthmaticus or during other acute episodes of asthma requiring intensive measures.</p><p>• Bone mineral density: Use with caution in patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral count such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (eg, anticonvulsants or oral corticosteroids); long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone in plasma.</p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma; increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.</p><p>• Pneumonia: Inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone, have been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in some long-term studies (&gt;6 months) in COPD patients (Dransfield 2013; Yang 2012). In addition, an observational study found a reduction in this risk when the inhaled corticosteroid was discontinued, particularly so with fluticasone (Suissa 2015).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients (~1 centimeter per year [range: 0.3 to 1.8 cm per year] and related to dose and duration of exposure). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• ArmonAir Digihaler, ArmonAir RespiClick, Arnuity Ellipta, and Flovent Diskus: May contain lactose; very rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients with severe milk protein allergy.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Discontinuation of therapy: A gradual tapering of dose may be required prior to discontinuing therapy; there have been reports of systemic corticosteroid withdrawal symptoms (eg, joint/muscle pain, lassitude, depression) when withdrawing oral inhalation therapy.</p><p>• Transfer to oral inhaler: When transferring to oral inhalation therapy from systemic corticosteroid therapy, previously suppressed allergic conditions (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions) may be unmasked. Withdraw systemic corticosteroid therapy by gradually tapering the dose. Monitor lung function, beta-agonist use, asthma symptoms, and for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (eg, fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea/vomiting, hypotension) during withdrawal.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Growth (adolescents and children via stadiometry); signs/symptoms of HPA axis suppression/adrenal insufficiency; signs/symptoms of oral candidiasis; possible eosinophilic conditions (including Churg-Strauss syndrome); FEV<sub>1</sub>, peak flow, and/or other pulmonary function tests; asthma symptoms; bone mineral density; hepatic impairment; glaucoma/cataracts</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Fluticasone can be detected in cord blood following maternal use via oral inhalation during pregnancy (Battista 2016).</p><p>Maternal use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in usual doses is not associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations; a small risk of malformations was observed in one study following high maternal doses of an alternative ICS. Uncontrolled asthma is associated with adverse events in pregnancy (increased risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight infants, cesarean delivery, and the development of gestational diabetes). Poorly controlled asthma or asthma exacerbations may have a greater fetal/maternal risk than what is associated with appropriately used asthma medications. Maternal treatment improves pregnancy outcomes by reducing the risk of some adverse events (eg, preterm birth, gestational diabetes) (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]; GINA 2020).</p><p>ICS are recommended for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy (GINA 2020). Fluticasone oral inhalation is considered compatible for use during pregnancy. Pregnant females adequately controlled on fluticasone for asthma may continue therapy; if initiating treatment during pregnancy, use of an agent with more data in pregnant females may be preferred. The lowest dose that maintains asthma control should be used. Maternal asthma symptoms should be monitored monthly during pregnancy (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]).</p><p>Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes associated with asthma and the medications used to treat asthma in pregnancy is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll exposed pregnant females in the MotherToBaby Pregnancy Studies conducted by the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (877-311-8972 or https://mothertobaby.org). Patients may also enroll themselves.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat asthma.</p><p>• Do not use this drug to treat an asthma attack.
