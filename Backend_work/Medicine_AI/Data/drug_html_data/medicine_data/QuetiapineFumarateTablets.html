Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span> <span class="Bold"><br/>
<span class="Bold">Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior</span><br/>
Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies.   These studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in patients over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in patients aged 65 and older <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</span> <span class="Bold"><br/>
In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span><br/>
Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is not approved for use in pediatric patients under ten years of age <span class="Italics">[see  Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></span></p><h2>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h2><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP in schizophrenia was established in one 6-week and one maintenance trial in adults with schizophrenia. Efficacy was supported by three 6-week trials in adults with schizophrenia and one 6-week trial in adolescents with schizophrenia (13-17 years) treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span></p><h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP is indicated for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP in manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder was established in one 3-week trial in adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.  Efficacy was supported by two 12-week monotherapy trials and one 3-week adjunctive trial in adults with manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder as well as one 3-week monotherapy trial in children and adolescents (10 – 17 years) with manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets <span class="Italics">[see  Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><p>Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP is indicated for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP was established in one 8-week trial in adults with bipolar I or II disorder and supported by two 8-week trials in adults with bipolar I or II disorder treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><p>Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP is indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was extrapolated from two maintenance trials in adults with bipolar I disorder treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets. The effectiveness of monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><h3>Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD. The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets USP as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in MDD was established in two 6-week trials in adults with MDD who had an inadequate response to antidepressant treatment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)].</span></p><h3>Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder</h3><p class="First">Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders, however, diagnosis can be challenging.  For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.</p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets should be swallowed whole and not split, chewed, or crushed.<br/>
It is recommended that Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets be taken without food or with a light meal (approximately 300 calories) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets should be administered once daily, preferably in the evening.</p><h3>Recommended Dosing</h3><p class="First">The recommended initial dose, titration, dose range and maximum Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets dose for each approved indication is displayed in Table 1 below. After initial dosing, adjustments can be made upwards or downwards, if necessary, depending upon the clinical response and tolerability of the patient <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2 and 14.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Maintenance Treatment for Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Maintenance Treatment</span>—Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies(14.1, 14.2)].<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p><h3>Dose Modifications in Elderly Patients</h3><p class="First">Consideration should be given to a slower rate of dose titration and a lower target dose in the elderly and in patients who are debilitated or who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.</p><p>Elderly patients should be started on Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets 50 mg/day and the dose can be increased in increments of 50 mg/day depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient.</p><h3>Dose Modifications in Hepatically Impaired Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients with hepatic impairment should be started on Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets 50 mg/day. The dose can be increased daily in increments of 50 mg/day to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient.</p><h3>Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets dose should be reduced to one sixth of original dose when co-medicated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets should be increased by 6-fold <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inducers</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets dose should be increased up to 5 fold of the original dose when used in combination with a chronic treatment (e.g., greater than 7-14 days) of a potent CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John’s wort etc.). The dose should be titrated based on the clinical response and tolerance of the individual patient. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets should be reduced to the original level within 7-14 days <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Re-initiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued</h3><p class="First">Although there are no data to specifically address re-initiation of treatment, it is recommended that when restarting therapy of patients who have been off Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets for more than one-week, the initial dosing schedule should be followed. When restarting patients who have been off Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets for less than one-week, gradual dose escalation may not be required and the maintenance dose may be re-initiated.</p><h3>Switching Patients from Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets to Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First">Patients who are currently being treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets may be switched to Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets at the equivalent total daily dose taken once daily. Individual dosage adjustments may be necessary.</p><h3>Switching from Antipsychotics</h3><p class="First">There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from other antipsychotics to Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal syndrome medication should be re-evaluated periodically.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS &amp; STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">• 50 mg extended-release tablets are maroon, film-coated, oval-shaped, biconvex, debossed “<span class="Italics">Q50</span>” on one side and plain on the other side.<br/>

Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients.  Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality.  The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning].</span></p><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults</h3><p class="First">Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2.</p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.<br/>
<br/>
It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p><p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.</span> Prescriptions for Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder:</span> A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects.  Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Boxed Warning</span> and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span></span>].</p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</h3><p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.  In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p><p>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.</p><p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose, and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these metabolic profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus<br/></span><br/>
Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.</p><p>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment.</p><p>Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.<br/>

<span class="Italics">Adults:</span></p><p>In a 24-week trial (active-controlled, 115 patients treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets) designed to evaluate glycemic status with oral glucose tolerance testing of all patients, at week 24 the incidence of a treatment-emergent post-glucose challenge glucose level ≥200 mg/dL was 1.7% and the incidence of a fasting treatment-emergent blood glucose level ≥126 mg/dL was 2.6%. The mean change in fasting glucose from baseline was 3.2 mg/dL and mean change in 2-hour glucose from baseline was -1.8 mg/dL for quetiapine.</p><p>In 2 long-term placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal clinical trials for bipolar I disorder maintenance, mean exposure of 213 days for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets (646 patients) and 152 days for placebo (680 patients), the mean change in glucose from baseline was +5.0 mg/dL for quetiapine and –0.05 mg/dL for placebo. The exposure-adjusted rate of any increased blood glucose level (≥126 mg/dL) for patients more than 8 hours since a meal (however, some patients may not have been precluded from calorie intake from fluids during fasting period) was 18.0 per 100 patient years for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets (10.7% of patients; n=556) and 9.5 for placebo per 100 patient years (4.6% of patients; n=581).</p><p>Table 4 shows the percentage of patients with shifts in blood glucose to ≥126 mg/dL from normal baseline in MDD adjunct therapy trials by dose.</p><p><span class="Italics"><br/>
Children and Adolescents:</span><br/>
Safety and effectiveness of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is supported from studies of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets in children and adolescent patients 10 to 17 years of age [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>]. In a placebo-controlled Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets monotherapy study (8 weeks duration) of children and adolescent patients (10-17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the mean change in fasting glucose levels for Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets (n=60) compared to placebo (n=62) was 1.8 mg/dL versus 1.6 mg/dL. In this study, there were no patients in the Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets or placebo-treated groups with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (&lt;100 mg/dL) that had an increase in blood glucose level ≥126 mg/dL. There was one patient in the Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets group with a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (≥100 mg/dL and &lt;126 mg/dL) who had an increase in blood glucose level of &gt;126 mg/dL compared to zero patients in the placebo group.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets monotherapy study of adolescent patients (13–17 years of age) with schizophrenia (6 weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose levels for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets (n=138) compared to placebo (n=67) was –0.75 mg/dL versus –1.70 mg/dL. In a placebo-controlled Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets monotherapy study of children and adolescent patients (10–17 years of age) with bipolar mania (3 weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose level for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets (n=170) compared to placebo (n=81) was 3.62 mg/dL versus –1.17 mg/dL. No patient in either study with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (&lt;100 mg/dL) or a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (≥100 mg/dL and &lt;126 mg/dL) had a treatment-emergent blood glucose level of ≥126 mg/dL.</p><p><span class="Italics"><br/>

The percentage of patients 13-17 years of age with weight gain ≥7% at any time was 10.4% (7/67) for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets vs. 13.9% (10/72) for placebo.</p><p>Table 10 shows the percentage of children and adolescents with weight gain ≥7% of body weight in clinical trials with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets in adolescents (13-17 years) with schizophrenia and in children and adolescents (10-17 years) with bipolar mania.</p><p>The mean change in body weight in the schizophrenia trial was 2.0 kg in the Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets group and -0.4 kg in the placebo group and in the bipolar mania trial it was 1.7 kg in the Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets group and 0.4 kg in the placebo group.</p><p>In an open-label study that enrolled patients from the above two pediatric trials, 63% of patients (241/380) completed 26 weeks of therapy with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets. After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean increase in body weight was 4.4 kg. Forty-five percent of the patients gained ≥7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. In order to adjust for normal growth over 26 weeks, an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change; 18.3% of patients on Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets met this criterion after 26 weeks of treatment.</p><p>When treating pediatric patients with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected for normal growth.</p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First">A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</p><p>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p><p>Given these considerations, Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p><p>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets, drug discontinuation should be considered.  However, some patients may require treatment with quetiapine despite the presence of the syndrome.<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h3>Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its ά1-adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 0.3% (5/1866) of the patients treated with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets across all indications, compared with 0.2% (2/928) on placebo. Syncope was reported in 1% (28/3265) of the patients treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets, compared with 0.2% (2/954) on placebo. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope may lead to falls.</p><p>Quetiapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate.</p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor, and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.</p><h3>Increases in Blood Pressure (Children and Adolescents)</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is supported by studies of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets in children and adolescent patients 10-17 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies(14.1 and 14.2)].</span></p><p>In a placebo-controlled quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets clinical trial (8 weeks duration) in children and adolescents (10-17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (≥20 mmHg) was 6.5% (6/92) for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets and 6.0% (6/100) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (≥10 mmHg) was 46.7% (43/92) for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets and 36.0% (36/100) for  placebo.</p><p>In placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (13-17 years old, 6-week duration) or bipolar mania (10-17 years old, 3-week duration), the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (≥20 mmHg) was 15.2% (51/335) for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets and 5.5% (9/163) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (≥10 mmHg) was 40.6% (136/335) for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets and 24.5% (40/163) for placebo. In the 26-week open-label clinical trial, one child with a reported history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment.</p><h3>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine fumarate. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported.<br/>
<br/>
Agranulocytosis has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal cases and cases in patients without pre-existing risk factors. Neutropenia should be considered in patients presenting with infection, particularly in the absence of obvious predisposing factor(s), or in patients with unexplained fever, and should be managed as clinically appropriate.</p><p>Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors.</p><p>Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) should discontinue Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets and have their WBC followed until recovery.</p><h3>Cataracts</h3><p class="First">The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span>. Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children, and adolescents during long-term quetiapine treatment but a causal relationship to quetiapine use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment.</p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10.1)]</span>, in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval .</p><p>The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).</p><p>Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.</p><p>Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g., cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure, and heart hypertrophy).</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">During short-term clinical trials with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets, seizures occurred in 0.05% (1/1866) of patients treated with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets across all indications compared to 0.3% (3/928) on placebo. During clinical trials with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets, seizures occurred in 0.5% (20/3490) of patients treated with Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets compared to 0.2% (2/954) on placebo. As with other antipsychotics, quetiapine fumarate should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer’s dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.</p><h3>Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T<span class="Sub">4</span>, irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear.  If there is an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patient’s thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T<span class="Sub">4</span>, in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at follow-up.</p><p>In quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets clinical trials across all indications 1.8% (24/1336) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets versus 0.6% (3/530) on placebo experienced decreased free thyroxine (&lt;0.8 LLN) and 1.6% (21/1346) on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets vs. 3.4% (18/534) on placebo experienced increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). About 0.7% (26/3489) of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment.</p><p>In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were1 : decrease in free T<span class="Sub">4</span> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 2.0% (357/17513); decrease in total T<span class="Sub">4</span> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 4.0% (75/1861); decrease in free T<span class="Sub">3</span> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 0.4% (53/13766); decrease in total T<span class="Sub">3</span> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 2.0% (26/1312), and increase in TSH (&gt;5 mIU/L), 4.9% (956/19412). In eight patients, where TBG was measured, levels of TBG were unchanged.</p><p>Table 11 shows the incidence of these shifts in short term placebo-controlled clinical trials.</p><p>In short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, the incidence of reciprocal shifts in T<span class="Sub">3</span> and TSH was 0.0% for both quetiapine (1/4800) and placebo (0/2190) and for T<span class="Sub">4</span> and TSH the shifts were 0.1% (7/6154) for quetiapine versus 0.0% (1/3007) for placebo.</p><p><span class="Italics">Children and Adolescents:</span> Safety and effectiveness of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is supported by studies of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets in children and adolescent patients 10-17 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1 and 14.2)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In acute placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6-week duration) or bipolar mania (3-week duration), the incidence of shifts at any time for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets treated patients and placebo-treated patients for elevated TSH was 2.9% (8/280) vs. 0.7% (1/138), respectively, and for decreased total thyroxine was 2.8% (8/289) vs. 0% (0/145), respectively. Of the Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 1 had simultaneous low free T<span class="Sub">4</span> level at end of treatment.</p><h3>Hyperprolactinemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> During clinical trials with quetiapine across all indications, the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a clinically significant value occurred in 3.6% (158/4416) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 2.6% (51/1968) on placebo.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Children and Adolescents:</span> Safety and effectiveness of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is supported by studies of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets in children and adolescent patients 10-17 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1 and 14.2)]</span>. In acute placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania (3-week duration) or schizophrenia (6-week duration), the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a value (&gt;20 μg/L males; &gt;26 μg/L females at any time) was 13.4% (18/134) for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets compared to 4% (3/75) for placebo in males and 8.7% (9/104) for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets compared to 0% (0/39) for placebo in females.<br/>
<br/></p><p>Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors, Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets elevates prolactin levels in some patients and the elevation may persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.<br/>
<br/></p><p>Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary, and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="First">Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3-day period of initial dose titration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 24.7% (235/951) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets compared to 10.3% (33/319) of placebo patients. In a bipolar depression clinical trial, somnolence was reported in 51.8% (71/137) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets compared to 12.9% (18/140) of placebo patients.  In a clinical trial for bipolar mania, somnolence was reported in 50.3% (76/151) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets compared to 11.9% (19/160) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls.</p><p>In short-term adjunctive therapy trials for MDD, somnolence was reported in 40% (252/627) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets respectively compared to 9% (27/309) of placebo patients. Somnolence was dose-related in these trials (37% (117/315) and 43% (135/312) for the 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively).</p><h3>Body Temperature Regulation</h3><p class="First">Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, eg, exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.</p><h3>Dysphagia</h3><p class="First">Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.</p><h3>Discontinuation Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine fumarate. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1993) for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets and 6.7% (71/1065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, and irritability) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1-week post-discontinuation. Gradual dose reduction is advised <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects</h3><p class="First">Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [<span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)</span>].</p><p>Constipation was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with quetiapine and represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal reports in patients who were receiving multiple concomitant medications that decrease intestinal motility.</p><p>Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation, or increased intraocular pressure.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><p>• Increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span><br/>

Adults<br/>
<br/></span></p><p>The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets consisting of approximately 3400 patients exposed to quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets for the treatment of Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder in placebo-controlled trials. This experience corresponds to approximately 1020.1 patient-years. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, body weights, laboratory analyses, and ECG results.<br/>

<br/>
Transaminase Elevations</p><p><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> Asymptomatic, transient and reversible elevations in serum transaminases (primarily ALT) have been reported. The proportions of adult patients with transaminase elevations of &gt;3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of placebo-controlled trials ranged between 1% and 2% for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets compared to 2% for placebo. In schizophrenia trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of &gt;3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled trials were approximately 6% (29/483) for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets compared to 1% (3/194) for placebo. These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 3 weeks of drug treatment and promptly returned to pre-study levels with ongoing treatment with quetiapine.<br/>
<br/>
Decreased Hemoglobin</p><p><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> In short-term placebo-controlled trials, decreases in hemoglobin to ≤13 g/dL males, ≤12 g/dL females on at least one occasion occurred in 8.3% (594/7155) of quetiapine-treated patients compared to 6.2% (219/3536) of patients treated with placebo. In a database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, decrease in hemoglobin to ≤13 g/dL males, ≤12 g/dL females on at least one occasion occurred in 11% (2277/20729) of quetiapine-treated patients.<br/>
<br/>
Interference with Urine Drug Screens</p><p>There have been literature reports suggesting false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results for these drugs, and confirmation by alternative analytical technique (e.g., chromatographic methods) should be considered.<br/>
<br/>
ECG Changes:</p><p><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> 2.5% of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets patients, and 2.3% of placebo patients, had tachycardia (&gt;120 bpm) at any time during the trials. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 6.3 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 0.4 beats per minute for placebo. This is consistent with the rates for Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets. The incidence of adverse reactions of tachycardia was 1.9% for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets compared to 0.5% for placebo.  Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute among placebo patients. The slight tendency for tachycardia may be related to quetiapine’s potential for inducing orthostatic changes <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span> .<br/>

<br/>
Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets, during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (<span class="Italics">see Clinical Considerations</span>). Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to quetiapine have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I, or major depressive disorder, and with exposure to antipsychotics, including, Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets during pregnancy (<span class="Italics">see Clinical Considerations</span>). In animal studies, embryo-fetal toxicity occurred including delays in skeletal ossification at approximately 1 and 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mg/day in both rats and rabbits, and an increased incidence of carpal/tarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the MRHD. In addition, fetal weights were decreased in both species. Maternal toxicity (observed as decreased body weights and/or death) occurred at 2 times the MRHD in rats and approximately 1-2 times the MRHD in rabbits.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations<br/></span> <br/>
<span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or fetal risk</span><br/>
There is a risk to the mother from untreated schizophrenia, or bipolar I disorder, including increased risk of relapse, hospitalization, and suicide. Schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are associated with increased adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth. It is not known if this is a direct result of the illness or other comorbid factors.<br/>
<br/></p><p>A prospective, longitudinal study followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressants. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions</span><br/>
Extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder have been reported in neonates who were exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets, during the third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms varied in severity. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms and manage symptoms appropriately. Some neonates recovered within hours or days without specific treatment; others required prolonged hospitalization.<br/>

In general, there was no indication of any different tolerability of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets in the elderly compared to younger adults. Nevertheless, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance, increase the pharmacodynamic response to Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period in the elderly. The mean plasma clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 30% to 50% in elderly patients when compared to younger patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Clinical experience with Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets in patients with renal impairment is limited <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in patients with hepatic impairment.  In this population, a low starting dose of 50 mg/day is recommended and the dose may be increased in increments of 50 mg/day <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is not a controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Human Experience</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported events. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug’s known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)</span>]. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose. There were also very rare reports of overdose of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets alone resulting in death or coma.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.</p><p>Appropriate supportive measures are the mainstay of management.

<br/></p><h2>Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of quetiapine in the listed indications is unclear. However, the efficacy of quetiapine in these indications could be mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D<span class="Sub">2</span>) and serotonin type 2A (5HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>) antagonism. The active metabolite, N-desalkyl quetiapine (norquetiapine), has similar activity at D<span class="Sub">2</span>, but greater activity at 5HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors, than the parent drug (quetiapine).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine and its metabolite norquetiapine have affinity for multiple neurotransmitter receptors with norquetiapine binding with higher affinity than quetiapine in general. The K<span class="Sub">i</span> values for quetiapine and norquetiapine  at the dopamine D<span class="Sub">1</span> are 428/99.8 nM, at D<span class="Sub">2</span> 626/489 nM, at serotonin 5HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> 1040/191 nM at 5HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> 38/2.9 nM, at histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> 4.4/1.1 nM, at muscarinic M<span class="Sub">1</span> 1086/38.3 nM, and at adrenergic α<span class="Sub">1</span>b 14.6/46.4 nM, and at α<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors 617/1290 nM, respectively. Quetiapine and norquetiapine lack appreciable affinity to the benzodiazepine receptors.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Effect on QT Interval<br/>
<br/>
In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine [<span class="Italics">see Overdosage (10.1)</span>], in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Adults<br/>
Following multiple dosing of quetiapine up to a total daily dose of 800 mg, administered in divided doses, the plasma concentration of quetiapine and norquetiapine, the major active metabolite of quetiapine, were proportional to the total daily dose. Accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Steady-state mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of norquetiapine are about 21-27% and 46-56%, respectively, of that observed for quetiapine. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism. The mean-terminal half-life is approximately 7 hours for quetiapine and approximately 12 hours for norquetiapine within the clinical dose range. Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing.  Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.<br/>
<br/>
Children and Adolescents<br/>
At steady state the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, in children and adolescents (10-17 years of age), were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of the parent compound were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were 45% and 31% higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span> .</p><p>Absorption</p><p>Quetiapine fumarate reaches peak plasma concentrations approximately 6 hours following administration. Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets dosed once daily at steady state has comparable bioavailability to an equivalent total daily dose of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets administered in divided doses, twice daily. A high-fat meal (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) was found to produce statistically significant increases in the quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of 44% to 52% and 20% to 22%, respectively, for the 50 mg and 300 mg tablets. In comparison, a light meal (approximately 300 calories) had no significant effect on the C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC of quetiapine. It is recommended that Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets be taken without food or with a light meal <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p>Distribution</p><p>Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 10±4 L/kg. It is 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine.</p><p>Metabolism and Elimination</p><p>Following a single oral dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-quetiapine, less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73% and 20% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. The average dose fraction of free quetiapine and its major active metabolite is &lt;5% excreted in the urine.</p><p>Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite; both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite norquetiapine.</p><p>Age</p><p>Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40% in elderly patients (≥65 years, n=9) compare to young patients (n=12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary <span class="Italics">[see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p>Gender</p><p>There is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.</p><p>Race</p><p>There is no race effect on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine.</p><p>Smoking</p><p>Smoking has no effect on the oral clearance of quetiapine.</p><p>Renal Insufficiency</p><p>Patients with severe renal impairment (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>=10 - 30 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>, n=8) had a 25% lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>&gt;80 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>, n=8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose.

In 2 of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects. Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</p><p>Drug-Drug Interaction Studies</p><p>The <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assessments of effect of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine are summarized in Table 24 <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5 and 2.6) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> enzyme inhibition data suggest that quetiapine and 9 of its metabolites would have little inhibitory effect on <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> metabolism mediated by cytochromes CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4.

Quetiapine was administered in the diet to mice at doses of 20, 75, 250, and 750 mg/kg and to rats by gavage at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg for two years. These doses are equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area (mice) or 0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area (rats). There were statistically significant increases in thyroid gland follicular adenomas in male mice at doses 1.5 and 4.5 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area and in male rats at a dose of 3 times the MRHD on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were statistically significantly increased in female rats at all doses tested (0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area).</p><p>Thyroid follicular cell adenomas may have resulted from chronic stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulting from enhanced metabolism and clearance of thyroxine by rodent liver. Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1-year toxicity study in rat; however, the results of these studies were not definitive. The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown.</p><p>Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum measurements in a 1-year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32- and 13-fold in male and female rats, respectively. Increases in mammary neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactin-mediated. The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactin-mediated mammary gland tumors in rats to human risk is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]</span>.</p><p>Mutagenesis</p><p>Quetiapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in standard genotoxicity tests. The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames bacterial gene mutation assay and in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The clastogenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes and in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats up to 500 mg/kg which is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area.</p><p>Impairment of Fertility</p><p>Quetiapine decreased mating and fertility in male Sprague-Dawley rats at oral doses of 50 and 150 mg/kg or approximately 1 and 3 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Drug-related effects included increases in interval to mate and in the number of matings required for successful impregnation. These effects continued to be observed at 3 times the MRHD even after a two-week period without treatment.  The no-effect dose for impaired mating and fertility in male rats was 25 mg/kg, or 0.3 times the MRHD dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Quetiapine adversely affected mating and fertility in female Sprague-Dawley rats at an oral dose approximately 1 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Drug-related effects included decreases in matings and in matings resulting in pregnancy, and an increase in the interval to mate. An increase in irregular estrus cycles was observed at doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg, or approximately 0.1 and 1 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. The no-effect dose in female rats was 1 mg/kg, or 0.01 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine caused a dose-related increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in rat toxicity studies which were 4 weeks in duration or longer and in a mouse 2-year carcinogenicity study. Doses were 10, 25, 50, 75, 150 and 250 mg/kg in rat studies which are approximately 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2 and 3-times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area, respectively. Doses in the mouse carcinogenicity study were 20, 75, 250 and 750 mg/kg which are approximately 0.1, 0.5, 1.5 and 4.5 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be co-localized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown.</p><p>In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1-month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mg/kg, or 4 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a dose-related reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeat-dose dog and monkey studies; however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs.  The appearance of delta-8-cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25% reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. Drug-related cataracts have not been seen in any other species; however, in a 1-year study in monkeys, a striated appearance of the anterior lens surface was detected in 2/7 females at a dose of 225 mg/kg or 5.5 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Short-term Trials – Adults</span></p><p>The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets in the treatment of schizophrenia was demonstrated in 1 short-term, 6-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trial of inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia (n=573) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets (once daily) was administered as 300 mg on Day 1, and the dose was increased to either 400 mg or 600 mg by Day 2, or 800 mg by Day 3. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at the end of treatment (Day 42).

The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder was established in one 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=280 outpatients). This study included patients with bipolar I and II disorder, and those with and without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets were administered 50 mg on Day 1, 100 mg on Day 2, 200 mg on Day 3, and 300 mg on Day 4 and after.</p><p>The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-rated scale with scores ranging from 0 (no depressive features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets were superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score at week 8 (study 6 in Table 28).</p><p>The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder was established in 2 identical 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=1045). These studies included patients with either bipolar I or II disorder and those with or without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets were administered fixed doses of either 300 mg or 600 mg once daily.</p><p>The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in these studies was the MADRS. The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. In both studies, Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets were superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score at week 8 (Studies 7 and 8 in Table 28). In these studies, no additional benefit was seen with the 600 mg dose. For the 300 mg dose group, statistically significant improvements over placebo were seen in overall quality of life and satisfaction related to various areas of functioning, as measured using the Q-LES-Q(SF).</p><p>Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex</p><p>The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials in patients (n=1326) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder (studies 9 and 10). The trials included patients whose most recent episode was manic, depressed, or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the open-label phase, patients were required to be stable on Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets plus lithium or divalproex for at least 12 weeks in order to be randomized. On average, patients were stabilized for 15 weeks. In the randomization phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or divalproex and were randomized to receive either Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets (administered twice daily totaling 400 mg/day to 800 mg/day) or placebo. Approximately 50% of the patients had discontinued from the Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets group by day 280 and 50% of the placebo group had discontinued by day 117 of double-blind treatment. The primary endpoint in these studies was time to recurrence of a mood event (manic, mixed, or depressed episode). A mood event was defined as medication initiation or hospitalization for a mood episode; YMRS score ≥20 or MADRS score ≥20 at 2 consecutive assessments; or study discontinuation due to a mood event.</p><p>In both studies, Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of any mood event (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The treatment effect was present for increasing time to recurrence of both manic and depressed episodes. The effect of Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets was independent of any specific subgroup (assigned mood stabilizer, sex, age, race, most recent bipolar episode, or rapid cycling course).<br/>

</p><h3>Major Depressive Disorder, Adjunctive Therapy to Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-release Tablets as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in the treatment of MDD was demonstrated in two 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials (n=936). Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets 150 mg/day or 300 mg/day was given as adjunctive therapy to existing antidepressant therapy in patients who had previously shown an inadequate response to at least one antidepressant. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets was administered as 50 mg/day on Days 1 and 2, and increased to 150 mg/day on Day 3 for both dose groups. On Day 5, the dose was increased to 300 mg/day in the 300 mg/day fixed-dose group. Inadequate response was defined as having continued depressive symptoms for the current episode [Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score of ≥20] despite using an antidepressant for 6 weeks at or above the minimally effective labelled dose. The mean HAM-D total score at entry was 24, and 17% of patients scored 28 or greater. Patients were on various antidepressants prior to study entry including SSRI’s (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or citalopram), SNRI’s, (duloxetine and venlafaxine,) TCA (amitriptyline), and other (bupropion).</p><p>The primary endpoint in these trials was change from baseline to week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS.), Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets 300 mg once daily as adjunctive treatment to other antidepressant therapy was superior to antidepressant alone in reduction of MADRS total score in both trials. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets 150 mg once daily as adjunctive treatment was superior to antidepressant therapy alone in reduction of MADRS total score in one trial (studies 1 and 2 in Table 29).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><ul class="Disc">
