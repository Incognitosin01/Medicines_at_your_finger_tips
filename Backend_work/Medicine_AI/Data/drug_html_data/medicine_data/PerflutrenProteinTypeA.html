While allowing the vial to come to room temperature, invert and gently rotate to resuspend the microspheres; solution should appear opaque and milky-white. Do <b>not</b> use if solution is clear. Vent vial with a sterile vent spike or 18-gauge needle. Do <b>not </b>inject air into vial. Within 1 minute of resuspension, remove dose from the vial and inject using a ≥20-gauge angiocatheter into a peripheral vein at a rate ≤1 mL/second. Flush line with D<sub>5</sub>W or NS immediately after injection. Repeat resuspension prior to injection if more than 1 minute elapses.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze.

Most serious reactions occur within 30 minutes of administration. Assess all patients for the presence of any condition that precludes administration. Always have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel readily available.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylactoid reactions: Serious anaphylactoid reactions (eg, shock, hypersensitivity, bronchospasm, throat tightness, angioedema, edema [oropharyngeal, peripheral, and localized], swelling [face, eye, lip, tongue, upper airway], facial hypoesthesia, rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, and erythema) have been reported in patients with no prior exposure. Monitor for signs and symptoms of anaphylactoid reactions. Equipment for resuscitation and trained personnel should be readily available.</p><p>• Serious cardiopulmonary reactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Serious cardiopulmonary reactions (some fatal) have occurred uncommonly during or within 30 minutes following administration. Assess all patients for the presence of any condition that precludes administration. Equipment for resuscitation and trained personnel </b><b>experienced in handling medical emergencies should always be immediately available<b>.</b></b> Risk may be increased in patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (eg, acute MI, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable heart failure, serious ventricular arrhythmias). However, multiple retrospective and prospective studies involving the use of perflutren-based ultrasound contrast agents have suggested they may be safely used in patients with significant cardiopulmonary disease (ie, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, COPD, pulmonary hypertension) or critical illness (Dolan 2009; Kurt 2009; Kusnetzky 2008; Main 2008; Main 2014; Nucifora 2008; Wei 2008; Wei 2012; Weiss 2012; Wever-Pinzon 2012).</p><p>• Ventricular arrhythmias: High ultrasound mechanical indices with or without end-systolic triggering may cause ventricular arrhythmias. Use is not recommended at mechanical indices &gt;0.8.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiac shunts: Assess patients for embolic phenomena following administration; microspheres can bypass filtering of the lung and enter the arterial circulation in patients with a cardiac shunt. Patients with small degrees of right-to-left shunting through patent foramen ovales (those that result in transient appearance of saline contrast in the left atrium or ventricle and do not fill the left atrial or LV cavity) are not considered at an increased risk for microvascular occlusion with perflutren-based ultrasound contrast agents (ASE [Porter 2014]; Kalra 2014; Muskula 2017; Parker 2013).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Albumin: Product contains albumin; may carry a remote risk of virus transmission or hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For IV administration; do not administer by intra-arterial injection.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Cardiopulmonary reactions (rare); signs and symptoms of anaphylactoid reactions (rare). Monitor patient as appropriate based upon patient clinical disposition; specific monitoring parameters based upon perflutren lipid microspheres administration are not necessary (Muskula 2017).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events have not been observed in animal reproduction studies.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used before a heart imaging test.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
