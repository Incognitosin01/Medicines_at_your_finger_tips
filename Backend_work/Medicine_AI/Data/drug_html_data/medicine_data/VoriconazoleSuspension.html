</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Voriconazole Suspension</h2><p class="First">Voriconazole is indicated for use in patients 12 years of age and older in the treatment of the following fungal infections:</p><h3>Invasive Aspergillosis</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, the majority of isolates recovered were <span class="Italics">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. There was a small number of cases of culture-proven disease due to species of <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span> other than <span class="Italics">A. fumigatus [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Candidemia in Non-neutropenic Patients and the Following Candida Infections: Disseminated Infections in Skin and Infections in Abdomen, Kidney, Bladder Wall, and Wounds</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4).]</span></p><h3>Esophageal Candidiasis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4).]</span></p><h3>Serious Fungal Infections Caused by Scedosporium apiospermum (Asexual Form of Pseudallescheria boydii) and Fusarium spp. Including Fusarium solani, in Patients Intolerant of, or Refractory to, Other Therapy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4).]</span></p><p>Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (including histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organism(s). Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known. However, once these results become available, antifungal therapy should be adjusted accordingly.</p><h2>Voriconazole Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Instructions for Use in All Patients</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole for oral suspension should be taken at least one hour before or after a meal.</p><h3>Recommended Dosing in Adults</h3><p class="First">See Table 1. Therapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of intravenous voriconazole on Day 1 followed by the recommended maintenance dose regimen. Intravenous treatment should be continued for at least 7 days. Once the patient has clinically improved and can tolerate medication given by mouth, the oral tablet form or oral suspension form of voriconazole may be utilized. The recommended oral maintenance dose of 200 mg achieves a voriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg IV; a 300 mg oral dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg IV. Switching between the intravenous and oral formulations is appropriate because of the high bioavailability of the oral formulation in adults <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span>.</p><p class="First">See Table 1. Patients should be treated for at least 14 days following resolution of symptoms or following last positive culture, whichever is longer.</p><p class="First">See Table 1. Patients should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and for at least 7 days following resolution of symptoms.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment</h3><p class="First">If patient response is inadequate, the oral maintenance dose may be increased from 200 mg every 12 hours (similar to 3 mg/kg IV q12h) to 300 mg every 12 hours (similar to 4 mg/kg IV q12h). For adult patients weighing less than 40 kg, the oral maintenance dose may be increased from 100 mg every 12 hours to 150 mg every 12 hours. If patient is unable to tolerate 300 mg orally every 12 hours, reduce the oral maintenance dose by 50 mg steps to a minimum of 200 mg every 12 hours (or to 100 mg every 12 hours for adult patients weighing less than 40 kg).</p><p>If patient is unable to tolerate 4 mg/kg IV q12h, reduce the intravenous maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg q12h.</p><p>The maintenance dose of voriconazole should be increased when coadministered with phenytoin or efavirenz <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>The maintenance dose of voriconazole should be reduced in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh Class A and B <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>. There are no PK data to allow for dosage adjustment recommendations in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Duration of therapy should be based on the severity of the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression and clinical response.</p><p>Duration of therapy should be based on the severity of the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression and clinical response.</p><h3>Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">Tap the bottle to release the powder. Add 50 mL of water to the bottle. Shake the closed bottle vigorously for about one minute. Remove child-resistant cap and push bottle adaptor into the neck of the bottle. Replace the cap. Write the date of expiration of the reconstituted suspension on the bottle label (the shelf life of the reconstituted suspension is 14 days at controlled room temperature 15-30°C (59-86°F).</p><p class="First">Shake the closed bottle of reconstituted suspension for approximately 10 seconds before each use. The reconstituted oral suspension should only be administered using the oral dispenser supplied with each pack.</p><p class="First">Voriconazole for oral suspension and the 40 mg/mL reconstituted oral suspension should not be mixed with any other medication or additional flavoring agent. It is not intended that the suspension be further diluted with water or other vehicles.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In the clinical program, patients were included who had baseline liver function tests (ALT, AST) up to 5 times the upper limit of normal. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with this degree of abnormal liver function, but continued monitoring of liver function tests for further elevations is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span>.</p><p>It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) or in patients with chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C disease. Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of orally administered voriconazole are not significantly affected by renal impairment. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for <span class="Bold">oral</span> dosing in patients with mild to severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and, if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span>.</p><p>Voriconazole is hemodialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. A 4-hour hemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Powder for Oral Suspension</span></p><p>Voriconazole for oral suspension is supplied in 100 mL high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. Each bottle contains 49 g of powder for oral suspension. Following reconstitution, the volume of the suspension is 75 mL, providing a usable volume of 70 mL (40 mg voriconazole/mL). A 5 mL oral dispenser and a press-in adaptor are also provided.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Voriconazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients. There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between voriconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing voriconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.</li>
<li>Coadministration of terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with voriconazole is contraindicated because increased plasma concentrations of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of <span class="Italics">Torsade de pointes [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</li>
<li>Coadministration of voriconazole with sirolimus is contraindicated because voriconazole significantly increases sirolimus concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</li>
<li>Coadministration of voriconazole with rifampin, carbamazepine and long-acting barbiturates is contraindicated because these drugs are likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></li>
<li>Coadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg q24h or higher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</li>
<li>Coadministration of voriconazole with high dose ritonavir (400 mg q12h) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg q12h) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations. Coadministration of voriconazole and low dose ritonavir (100 mg q12h) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</li>
<li>Coadministration of voriconazole with rifabutin is contraindicated since voriconazole significantly increases rifabutin plasma concentrations and rifabutin also significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></li>
<li>Coadministration of voriconazole with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) is contraindicated because voriconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids, which may lead to ergotism <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</li>
<li>Coadministration of voriconazole with St. John's Wort is contraindicated because this herbal supplement may decrease voriconazole plasma concentration <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">See Table 6 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 7 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Toxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities).</span> Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.3)]</span>.</p><p>Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit-risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.7), and Adverse Reactions (6.3)].</span></p><h3>Visual Disturbances</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days.</span> There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field and color perception should be monitored <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.</p><p>In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality. Please refer to section 8.1 (Pregnancy) for additional details.</p><p>If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><h3>Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as <span class="Italics">torsade de pointes</span>), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.</p><p>Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Congenital or acquired QT-prolongation</li>
<li>Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present</li>
<li>Sinus bradycardia</li>
<li>Existing symptomatic arrhythmias</li>
<li>Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span> ]</li>
</ul><p>Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Infusion Related Reactions</h3><p class="First">During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy.</p><p>Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin).</p><h3>Patients With Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">It is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) receiving voriconazole <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>.</p><p>Voriconazole has not been studied in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C). Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice, and should only be used in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic insufficiency must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.</p><h3>Patients With Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.8)]</span>.</p><h3>Monitoring Renal Function</h3><p class="First">Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function.</p><p>Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation, particularly serum creatinine.</p><h3>Monitoring Pancreatic Function</h3><p class="First">Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment.</p><h3>Dermatological Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued.</p><p>Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including children, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued.</p><p>The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation.</p><h3>Skeletal Adverse Events</h3><p class="First">Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><h3>Overview</h3><p class="First">The most frequently reported adverse events (all causalities) in the therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The treatment-related adverse events which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash and visual disturbances <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience in Adults</h3><p class="First">The data described in Table 2 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in the therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11- 90, including 51 patients aged 12-18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 2 includes all adverse events which were reported at an incidence of ≥2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of &lt;2%.</p><p>In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy in the primary treatment of patients with acute invasive aspergillosis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.</p><p class="First">Voriconazole treatment-related visual disturbances are common. In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses.</p><p>There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p>The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug dosing. Fourteen days after end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><p class="First">Dermatological reactions were common in the patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown.</p><p>Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued.</p><p>In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reactions. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. In patients with photosensitivity skin reactions, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term therapy. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]</span>.</p><p class="First">The following adverse events occurred in &lt;2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (n = 1655). This listing includes events where a causal relationship to voriconazole cannot be ruled out or those which may help the physician in managing the risks to the patients.

Laboratory Values</h3><p class="First">The overall incidence of clinically significant transaminase abnormalities in all therapeutic studies was 12.4% (206/1655) of patients treated with voriconazole. Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions.</p><p>Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function.

Other effects in rats included reduced ossification of sacral and caudal vertebrae, skull, pubic and hyoid bone, supernumerary ribs, anomalies of the sternebrae and dilatation of the ureter/renal pelvis. Plasma estradiol in pregnant rats was reduced at all dose levels. Voriconazole treatment in rats produced increased gestational length and dystocia, which were associated with increased perinatal pup mortality at the 10 mg/kg dose. The effects seen in rabbits were an increased embryomortality, reduced fetal weight and increased incidences of skeletal variations, cervical ribs and extrasternebral ossification sites.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether voriconazole is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from voriconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.</p><p>A total of 22 patients aged 12 to 18 years with invasive aspergillosis were included in the therapeutic studies. Twelve out of 22 (55%) patients had successful response after treatment with a maintenance dose of voriconazole 4 mg/kg q12h.</p><p>Sparse plasma sampling for pharmacokinetics in adolescents was conducted in the therapeutic studies <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of pancreatitis in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In multiple dose therapeutic trials of voriconazole, 9.2% of patients were ≥65 years of age and 1.8% of patients were ≥75 years of age. In a study in healthy subjects, the systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) were increased in elderly males compared to young males. Pharmacokinetic data obtained from 552 patients from 10 voriconazole therapeutic trials showed that voriconazole plasma concentrations in the elderly patients were approximately 80% to 90% higher than those in younger patients after either IV or oral administration. However, the overall safety profile of the elderly patients was similar to that of the young so no dosage adjustment is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Women of Childbearing Potential</h3><p class="First">Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment. The coadministration of voriconazole with the oral contraceptive, Ortho-Novum<span class="Sup">®</span> (35 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg norethindrone), results in an interaction between these two drugs, but is unlikely to reduce the contraceptive effect.

All occurred in pediatric patients who received up to five times the recommended intravenous dose of voriconazole. A single adverse event of photophobia of 10 minutes duration was reported.</p><p>There is no known antidote to voriconazole.</p><p>Voriconazole is hemodialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. In an overdose, hemodialysis may assist in the removal of voriconazole and SBECD from the body.</p><p>The minimum lethal oral dose in mice and rats was 300 mg/kg (equivalent to 4 and 7 times the recommended maintenance dose (RMD), based on body surface area). At this dose, clinical signs observed in both mice and rats included salivation, mydriasis, titubation (loss of balance while moving), depressed behavior, prostration, partially closed eyes and dyspnea. Other signs in mice were convulsions, corneal opacification and swollen abdomen.</p><h2>Voriconazole Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">Voriconazole, an azole antifungal agent, is available as a powder for oral suspension. The structural formula is:</p><p>Voriconazole is designated chemically as (2R,3S)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(5-fluoro-4- pyrimidinyl)-1-(1H-1,2,4 triazol-1-yl)-2-butanol with a empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">14</span>F<span class="Sub">3</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O and a molecular weight of 349.3.</p><p>Voriconazole drug substance is a white to almost white powder.</p><p>Voriconazole for oral suspension is a white to off-white powder providing a white to off-white orange-flavored suspension when reconstituted. Bottles containing 49 g powder for oral suspension are intended for reconstitution with water to produce a suspension containing 40 mg/mL voriconazole. The inactive ingredients include colloidal silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, xanthan gum, sodium citrate dihydrate, sodium benzoate, anhydrous citric acid, natural and artificial orange flavor, and sucrose.</p><h2>Voriconazole Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole is an antifungal drug <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterized in healthy subjects, special populations and patients.</p><p>During oral administration of 200 mg or 300 mg twice daily for 14 days in patients at risk of aspergillosis (mainly patients with malignant neoplasms of lymphatic or hematopoietic tissue), the observed pharmacokinetic characteristics were similar to those observed in healthy subjects.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. The interindividual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. Greater than proportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, increasing the oral dose from 200 mg q12h to 300 mg q12h leads to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">τ</span>); similarly, increasing the intravenous dose from 3 mg/kg q12h to 4 mg/kg q12h produces an approximately 2.5-fold increase in exposure (Table 8).</p><p class="First Footnote">Note: Parameters were estimated based on non-compartmental analysis from five pharmacokinetic studies.AUC<span class="Sub">1</span><span class="Sub">2</span> = area under the curve over 12 hour dosing interval, C<span class="Sub">m</span><span class="Sub">a</span><span class="Sub">x</span> = maximum plasma concentration, C<span class="Sub">m</span><span class="Sub">i</span><span class="Sub">n</span> = minimum plasma concentration. CV = coefficient of variation.<br/></p><p>Sparse plasma sampling for pharmacokinetics was conducted in the therapeutic studies in patients aged 12 - 18 years. In 11 adolescent patients who received a mean voriconazole maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg IV, the median of the calculated mean plasma concentrations was 1.60 µg/mL (inter-quartile range 0.28 to 2.73 µg/mL). In 17 adolescent patients for whom mean plasma concentrations were calculated following a mean oral maintenance dose of 200 mg q12h, the median of the calculated mean plasma concentrations was 1.16 µg/mL (inter-quartile range 0.85 to 2.14 µg/mL).</p><p>When the recommended intravenous loading dose regimen is administered to healthy subjects, plasma concentrations close to steady-state are achieved within the first 24 hours of dosing (e.g., 6 mg/kg IV q12h on day 1 followed by 3 mg/kg IV q12h). Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during twice-daily multiple dosing with steady-state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by day 6 in the majority of subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption-</span> The pharmacokinetic properties of voriconazole are similar following administration by the intravenous and oral routes. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data in healthy subjects (N = 207), the oral bioavailability of voriconazole is estimated to be 96% (CV 13%). Bioequivalence was established between the 200 mg tablet and the 40 mg/mL oral suspension when administered as a 400 mg q12h loading dose followed by a 200 mg q12h maintenance dose.</p><p>Maximum plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) are achieved 1 - 2 hours after dosing. When multiple doses of voriconazole are administered with high fat meals, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">τ</span> are reduced by 34% and 24%, respectively when administered as a tablet and by 58% and 37% respectively when administered as the oral suspension <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><p>In healthy subjects, the absorption of voriconazole is not affected by coadministration of oral ranitidine, cimetidine or omeprazole, drugs that are known to increase gastric pH.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution-</span> The volume of distribution at steady-state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58% and was shown to be independent of plasma concentrations achieved following single and multiple oral doses of 200 mg or 300 mg (approximate range: 0.9 - 15 µg/mL). Varying degrees of hepatic and renal insufficiency do not affect the protein binding of voriconazole.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism- In vitro</span> studies showed that voriconazole is metabolized by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vivo</span> studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism. For example, 15% to 20% of Asian populations may be expected to be poor metabolizers. For Caucasians and Blacks, the prevalence of poor metabolizers is 3% to 5%. Studies conducted in Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects have shown that poor metabolizers have, on average, 4-fold higher voriconazole exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">τ</span>) than their homozygous extensive metabolizer counterparts. Subjects who are heterozygous extensive metabolizers have, on average, 2-fold higher voriconazole exposure than their homozygous extensive metabolizer counterparts.</p><p>The major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating radiolabelled metabolites in plasma. Since this metabolite has minimal antifungal activity, it does not contribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion-</span> Voriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine. After administration of a single radiolabelled dose of either oral or IV voriconazole, preceded by multiple oral or IV dosing, approximately 80% to 83% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine. The majority (&gt; 94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous dosing.</p><p>As a result of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life of voriconazole is dose dependent and therefore not useful in predicting the accumulation or elimination of voriconazole.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clinical Efficacy and Safety-</span> In ten clinical trials, the median values for the average and maximum voriconazole plasma concentrations in individual patients across these studies (n = 1121) was 2.51 µg/mL (inter-quartile range 1.21 to 4.44 µg/mL) and 3.79 µg/mL (inter-quartile range 2.06 to 6.31 µg/mL), respectively. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of patient data from six of these ten clinical trials (n = 280) could not detect a positive association between mean, maximum or minimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy. However, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of the data from all ten clinical trials identified positive associations between plasma voriconazole concentrations and rate of both liver function test abnormalities and visual disturbances <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Electrocardiogram-</span> A placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QT interval of healthy male and female subjects was conducted with three single oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole.</p><p>Serial ECGs and plasma samples were obtained at specified intervals over a 24 hour post-dose observation period. The placebo-adjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1200 and 1600 mg of voriconazole and after ketoconazole 800 mg were all &lt; 10 msec. Females exhibited a greater increase in QTc than males, although all mean changes were &lt; 10 msec. Age was not found to affect the magnitude of increase in QTc. No subject in any group had an increase in QTc of ≥ 60 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec.

The majority of study patients had underlying hematologic malignancies, including bone marrow transplantation. The study also included patients with solid organ transplantation, solid tumors, and AIDS. The patients were mainly treated for definite or probable invasive aspergillosis of the lungs. Other aspergillosis infections included disseminated disease, CNS infections and sinus infections. Diagnosis of definite or probable invasive aspergillosis was made according to criteria modified from those established by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NIAID MSG/EORTC).</p><p>Voriconazole was administered intravenously with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours for a minimum of seven days. Therapy could then be switched to the oral formulation at a dose of 200 mg q12h. Median duration of IV voriconazole therapy was 10 days (range 2 - 85 days). After IV voriconazole therapy, the median duration of PO voriconazole therapy was 76 days (range 2 - 232 days).</p><p>Patients in the comparator group received conventional amphotericin B as a slow infusion at a daily dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/day. Median duration of IV amphotericin therapy was 12 days (range 1 - 85 days). Treatment was then continued with other licensed antifungal therapy (OLAT), including itraconazole and lipid amphotericin B formulations. Although initial therapy with conventional amphotericin B was to be continued for at least two weeks, actual duration of therapy was at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who discontinued initial randomized therapy due to toxicity or lack of efficacy were eligible to continue in the study with OLAT treatment.</p><p>A satisfactory global response at 12 weeks (complete or partial resolution of all attributable symptoms, signs, radiographic/bronchoscopic abnormalities present at baseline) was seen in 53% of voriconazole treated patients compared to 32% of amphotericin B treated patients (Table 13). A benefit of voriconazole compared to amphotericin B on patient survival at Day 84 was seen with a 71% survival rate on voriconazole compared to 58% on amphotericin B (Table 11).</p><p>Table 11 also summarizes the response (success) based on mycological confirmation and species.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span>Assessed by independent Data Review Committee (DRC)</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">b</span>Proportion of subjects alive</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">c</span>Amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">d</span>Difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval are stratified by protocol</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">e</span>Not all mycologically confirmed specimens were speciated</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">f</span>Some patients had more than one species isolated at baseline</p><p class="First">In this non-comparative study, an overall success rate of 52% (26/50) was seen in patients treated with voriconazole for primary therapy. Success was seen in 17/29 (59%) with Aspergillus fumigatus infections and 3/6 (50%) patients with infections due to non-fumigatus species [A. flavus (1/1); A. nidulans (0/2); A. niger (2/2); A. terreus (0/1)]. Success in patients who received voriconazole as salvage therapy is presented in Table 12.</p><p class="First">Additional data regarding response rates in patients who were refractory to, or intolerant of, other antifungal agents are also provided in Table 14. In this non-comparative study, overall mycological eradication for culture-documented infections due to <span class="Italics">fumigatus</span> and non-<span class="Italics">fumigatus</span> species of <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span> was 36/82 (44%) and 12/30 (40%), respectively, in voriconazole treated patients. Patients had various underlying diseases and species other than A. fumigatus contributed to mixed infections in some cases.</p><p>For patients who were infected with a single pathogen and were refractory to, or intolerant of, other antifungal agents, the satisfactory response rates for voriconazole in studies 304 and 309/604 are presented in Table 12.</p><p>Nineteen patients had more than one species of <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span> isolated. Success was seen in 4/17 (24%) of these patients.</p><h3>Candidemia in Nonneutropenic Patients and Other Deep Tissue Candida Infections</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole was compared to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in Study 608, an open label, comparative study in non-neutropenic patients with candidemia associated with clinical signs of infection. Patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either voriconazole (n = 283) or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (n = 139). Patients were treated with randomized study drug for a median of 15 days. Most of the candidemia in patients evaluated for efficacy was caused by <span class="Italics">C. albicans</span> (46%), followed by <span class="Italics">C. tropicalis</span> (19%), <span class="Italics">C. parapsilosis</span> (17%), <span class="Italics">C. glabrata</span> (15%) and <span class="Italics">C. krusei</span> (1%).</p><p>An independent Data Review Committee (DRC), blinded to study treatment, reviewed the clinical and mycological data from this study, and generated one assessment of response for each patient. A successful response required all of the following: resolution or improvement in all clinical signs and symptoms of infection, blood cultures negative for <span class="Italics">Candida</span>, infected deep tissue sites negative for <span class="Italics">Candida</span> or resolution of all local signs of infection, and no systemic antifungal therapy other than study drug. The primary analysis, which counted DRC-assessed successes at the fixed time point (12 weeks after End of Therapy [EOT]), demonstrated that voriconazole was comparable to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (response rates of 41% and 41%, respectively) in the treatment of candidemia. Patients who did not have a 12-week assessment for any reason were considered a treatment failure.</p><p>The overall clinical and mycological success rates by <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species in Study 150-608 are presented in Table 13.</p><p>In a secondary analysis, which counted DRC-assessed successes at any time point (EOT, or 2, 6 or 12 weeks after EOT), the response rates were 65% for voriconazole and 71% for the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.</p><p>In Studies 608 and 309/604 (non-comparative study in patients with invasive fungal infections who were refractory to, or intolerant of, other antifungal agents), voriconazole was evaluated in 35 patients with deep tissue <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections. A favorable response was seen in 4 of 7 patients with intra-abdominal infections, 5 of 6 patients with kidney and bladder wall infections, 3 of 3 patients with deep tissue abscess or wound infection, 1 of 2 patients with pneumonia/pleural space infections, 2 of 4 patients with skin lesions, 1 of 1 patients with mixed intra-abdominal and pulmonary infection, 1 of 2 patients with suppurative phlebitis, 1 of 3 patients with hepatosplenic infection, 1 of 5 patients with osteomyelitis, 0 of 1 with liver infection and 0 of 1 with cervical lymph node infection.</p><h3>Esophageal Candidiasis</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of oral voriconazole 200 mg twice daily compared to oral fluconazole 200 mg once daily in the primary treatment of esophageal candidiasis was demonstrated in Study 150-305, a double-blind, double-dummy study in immunocompromised patients with endoscopically-proven esophageal candidiasis. Patients were treated for a median of 15 days (range 1 to 49 days). Outcome was assessed by repeat endoscopy at end of treatment (EOT). A successful response was defined as a normal endoscopy at EOT or at least a 1 grade improvement over baseline endoscopic score. For patients in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population with only a baseline endoscopy, a successful response was defined as symptomatic cure or improvement at EOT compared to baseline. Voriconazole and fluconazole (200 mg once daily) showed comparable efficacy rates against esophageal candidiasis, as presented in Table 14.</p><p>Microbiologic success rates by <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species are presented in Table 15.</p><h3>Other Serious Fungal Pathogens</h3><p class="First">In pooled analyses of patients, voriconazole was shown to be effective against the following additional fungal pathogens:</p><p><span class="Italics">Scedosporium apiospermum <span class="Bold">-</span></span> Successful response to voriconazole therapy was seen in 15 of 24 patients (63%). Three of these patients relapsed within 4 weeks, including 1 patient with pulmonary, skin and eye infections, 1 patient with cerebral disease and 1 patient with skin infection. Ten patients had evidence of cerebral disease and 6 of these had a successful outcome (1 relapse). In addition, a successful response was seen in 1 of 3 patients with mixed organism infections.</p><p><span class="Italics">Fusarium spp.<span class="Bold">-</span></span> Nine of 21 (43%) patients were successfully treated with voriconazole. Of these 9 patients, 3 had eye infections, 1 had an eye and blood infection, 1 had a skin infection, one had a blood infection alone, two had sinus infections and one had disseminated infection (pulmonary, skin, hepatosplenic). Three of these patients (one with disseminated disease, one with an eye infection and one with a blood infection) had <span class="Italics">Fusarium solani</span> and were complete successes. Two of these patients relapsed, one with a sinus infection and profound neutropenia and one post surgical patient with blood and eye infections.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole for Oral Suspension is supplied in 100 mL high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles.
