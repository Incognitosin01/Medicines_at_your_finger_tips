This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Serious side effects can happen to people taking Qternmet XR, including:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Lactic Acidosis.</strong> Metformin, one of the medicines in Qternmet XR, can cause a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis (a build-up of an acid in the blood) that can cause death. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in the hospital.<br/>
Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms, which could be signs of lactic acidosis:
<ul>
<li>you feel cold in your hands or feet</li>
<li>you feel dizzy or lightheaded</li>
<li>you have a slow or irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>you feel very weak or tired</li>
<li>you have unusual (not normal) muscle pain</li>
<li>you have trouble breathing</li>
<li>you feel unusual sleepiness or sleep longer than usual</li>
<li>you have stomach pains, nausea, or vomiting</li>
</ul>
Most people who have had lactic acidosis with metformin have other things that, combined with the metformin use, led to the lactic acidosis. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the following, because you have a higher chance for getting lactic acidosis with Qternmet XR if you:
<ul>
<li>have severe kidney problems or your kidneys are affected by certain x-ray tests that use injectable dye</li>
<li>have liver problems</li>
<li>drink alcohol very often, or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term "binge" drinking</li>
<li>get dehydrated (lose a large amount of body fluids). This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Dehydration can also happen when you sweat a lot with activity or exercise and do not drink enough fluids.</li>
<li>have surgery</li>
<li>have a heart attack, severe infection, or stroke.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to keep from having a problem with lactic acidosis from metformin is to tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the problems in the list above. Your healthcare provider may decide to stop your Qternmet XR for a while if you have any of these problems.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).</strong> Saxagliptin, one of the medicines in Qternmet XR, can cause inflammation of the pancreas, which may be severe and lead to death. Certain medical problems make you more likely to get pancreatitis.<br/>
Before you start treatment, tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had:
<ul>
<li>inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis)</li>
<li>stones in your gallbladder (gallstones)</li>
<li>a history of alcoholism</li>
<li>high blood triglyceride levels</li>
</ul>
It is not known if having these medical problems will make you more likely to get pancreatitis with Qternmet XR.<br/>
Stop taking Qternmet XR and contact your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe and will not go away. The pain may be felt going from your abdomen through to your back. The pain may happen with or without vomiting. These may be symptoms of pancreatitis.</li>
<li><strong>Heart failure.</strong> Heart failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough. Before you start treatment, tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had heart failure or have problems with your kidneys.<br/>
Contact your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms:
<ul>
<li>increasing shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially when you lie down</li>
<li>swelling or fluid retention, especially in the feet, ankles, or legs</li>
<li>an unusually fast increase in weight</li>
<li>unusual tiredness</li>
</ul>
These may be symptoms of heart failure.</li>
<li><strong>Dehydration.</strong> Qternmet XR can cause some people to become dehydrated (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, lightheaded, or weak, especially when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you:
<ul>
<li>have low blood pressure</li>
<li>take medicines to lower your blood pressure, including water pills (diuretics)</li>
<li>are 65 years of age or older</li>
<li>are on a low salt diet</li>
<li>have kidney problems</li>
</ul>

<li>See <i>Important information</i>.</li>
<li><strong>Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine).</strong> Ketoacidosis has happened in people who have type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, during treatment with dapagliflozin, one of the medicines in Qternmet XR. Ketoacidosis is a serious condition, which may need to be treated in a hospital. Ketoacidosis may lead to death. Ketoacidosis can happen with dapagliflozin even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL.<br/>

<ul>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>tiredness</li>

Tell your healthcare provider if you have any signs or symptoms of a urinary tract infection such as a burning feeling when passing urine, a need to urinate often, the need to urinate right away, pain in the lower part of your stomach (pelvis), or blood in the urine. Sometimes people also may have a fever, back pain, nausea or vomiting.</li>
<li><strong>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).</strong> If you take Qternmet XR with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin, this can increase your risk of getting low blood sugar. Tell your healthcare provider if you take other diabetes medicines. Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar may include:
<ul>
<li>shaking or feeling jittery</li>
<li>hunger</li>
<li>change in mood</li>

<li>skin rash, itching, flaking, or peeling</li>
<li>raised red patches on your skin (hives)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Low vitamin B12 (vitamin B12 deficiency).</strong> Using metformin for long periods of time may cause a decrease in the amount of vitamin B12 in your blood, especially if you have had low vitamin B12 levels before. Your healthcare provider may do blood tests to check your vitamin B12 levels.</li>
<li><strong>Vaginal yeast infection.</strong> Women who take Qternmet XR may get vaginal yeast infections. Symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection include:

<li><strong>Bladder cancer.</strong> In studies of dapagliflozin in people with diabetes, bladder cancer occurred in a few more people who were taking dapagliflozin than in people who were taking other diabetes medicines. There were too few cases to know if bladder cancer was related to dapagliflozin. You should not take Qternmet XR if you have bladder cancer. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms:
<ul>
<li>blood or a red color in your urine</li>
<li>pain while you urinate</li>
