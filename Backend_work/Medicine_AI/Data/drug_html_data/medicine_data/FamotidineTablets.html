Since famotidine blood levels are higher in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function, dosage adjustments are recommended in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Concurrent Gastric Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with famotidine does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider evaluation for gastric malignancy in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with famotidine.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Famotidine was studied in 7 US and international placebo- and active-controlled trials in approximately 2500 patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. A total of 1442 patients were treated with famotidine, including 302 treated with 40 mg twice daily, 456 treated with 20 mg twice daily, 461 treated with 40 mg once daily, and 396 treated with 20 mg once daily. The population was 17-91 years old, fairly well distributed between gender and race; however, the predominant race treated was Caucasian.</p><p>The following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of famotidine-treated patients: headache, dizziness and constipation.</p><p>The following other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> fever, asthenia, fatigue</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> palpitations</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic:</span> thrombocytopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity:</span> orbital edema, rash, conjunctival injection, bronchospasm</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System/Psychiatric:</span> seizure, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, decreased libido, insomnia, somnolence</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin:</span> pruritus, dry skin, flushing</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> tinnitus, taste disorder</p><p><span class="Italics">Other:</span> impotence</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of famotidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular</span>: arrhythmia, AV block, prolonged QT interval</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal</span>: cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic</span>: agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity</span>: anaphylaxis, angioedema, facial edema, urticaria</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramps</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System/Psychiatric</span>: confusion, agitation, paresthesia</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory</span>: interstitial pneumonia</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin</span>: toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption</h3><p class="First">Famotidine can reduce the absorption of other drugs, due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity, leading to loss of efficacy of the concomitant drug.</p><p>Concomitant administration of famotidine with dasatinib, delavirdine mesylate, cefditoren, and fosamprenavir is not recommended.</p><p>See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption for administration instructions, including atazanavir, erlotinib, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, nilotinib, and rilpivirine.</p><h3>Tizanidine (CYP1A2 Substrate)</h3><p class="First">Although not studied clinically, famotidine is considered a weak CYP1A2 inhibitor and may lead to substantial increases in blood concentrations of tizanidine, a CYP1A2 substrate. Avoid concomitant use with famotidine. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor for hypotension, bradycardia or excessive drowsiness. Refer to the full prescribing information for tizanidine.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p><br/>
Available data with H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonists, including famotidine, in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse development effects were observed with oral administration of famotidine at doses up to approximately 243 and 122 times, respectively, the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day for the treatment of erosive esophagitis (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>).</p><p>The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses of up to 2000 and 500 mg/kg/day, respectively, and in both species at intravenous doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day, and have revealed no significant evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to famotidine. While no direct fetotoxic effects have been observed, sporadic abortions occurring only in mothers displaying marked decreased food intake were seen in some rabbits at oral doses of 200 mg/kg/day (about 49 times the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day, based on body surface area) or higher. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are limited data available on the presence of famotidine in human breast milk. There were no effects on the breastfed infant. There are no data on famotidine effects on milk production. Famotidine is present in the milk of lactating rats (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>).</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for famotidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from famotidine or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Transient growth depression was observed in young rats suckling from mothers treated with maternotoxic doses of famotidine at least 600 times the usual human dose.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of famotidine have been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease (i.e., duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer) and GERD (i.e., symptomatic nonerosive GERD, erosive esophagitis as diagnosed by endoscopy). The use of famotidine and the recommended dosage of famotidine in these pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of famotidine in adults and published pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2,12.3)]</span>. In pediatric patients, the safety and effectiveness for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions and reduction of risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence have not been established.</p><p>Famotidine 20 and 40 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg because these tablet strengths exceed the recommended dose for these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. For pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg, consider another famotidine formulation (e.g., oral suspension, lower dose tablet).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 1442 famotidine-treated patients in clinical studies, approximately 10% were 65 and older. In these studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. In postmarketing experience, CNS adverse reactions have been reported in elderly patients with and without renal impairment receiving famotidine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>Famotidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to famotidine may be greater in elderly patients, particularly those with impaired renal function <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>In general, use the lowest effective dose of famotidine for an elderly patient and monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">CNS adverse reactions and prolonged QT intervals have been reported in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span> The clearance of famotidine is reduced in adults with moderate and severe renal impairment compared to adults with normal renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute). Dosage reduction is recommended in adult and pediatric patients greater than or equal to 40 kg with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The types of adverse reactions in overdosage of famotidine are similar to the adverse reactions encountered with use of recommended dosages <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Unabsorbed material should be removed from the gastrointestinal tract, the patient should be monitored, and supportive therapy should be employed.</p><p>Due to low binding to plasma proteins, famotidine is eliminated by hemodialysis. There is limited experience on the usefulness of hemodialysis as a treatment for famotidine overdosage.</p><h2>Famotidine Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in Famotidine Tablets USP is a histamine-2 (H<span class="Sub">2</span>) receptor antagonist. Famotidine is <span class="Italics">N'</span>-(aminosulfonyl)-3-[[[2-[(diaminomethylene)amino]-4-thiazolyl]methyl]thio]propanimidamide. The empirical formula of famotidine is C<span class="Sub">8</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>N<span class="Sub">7</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>S<span class="Sub">3</span> and its molecular weight is 337.43. Its structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Each Famotidine Tablet, USP for oral administration contains either 20 mg or 40 mg of famotidine USP and the following inactive ingredients: hypromellose, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, ls-hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, pregelatinized starch, talc and titanium dioxide.</p><p>Famotidine USP is a white to pale yellow crystalline compound that is freely soluble in glacial acetic acid, slightly soluble in methanol, very slightly soluble in water, and practically insoluble in ethanol.</p><h2>Famotidine Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine-2 (H<span class="Sub">2</span>) receptors. The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>Famotidine inhibited both basal and nocturnal gastric secretion, as well as secretion stimulated by food and pentagastrin. After oral administration of famotidine, the onset of the antisecretory effect occurred within one hour; the maximum effect was dose-dependent, occurring within one to three hours. Duration of inhibition of secretion by doses of 20 mg and 40 mg was 10 to 12 hours.</p><p>Single evening oral doses of 20 mg and 40 mg inhibited basal and nocturnal acid secretion in all subjects; mean nocturnal gastric acid secretion was inhibited by 86% and 94%, respectively, for a period of at least 10 hours. The same doses given in the morning suppressed food-stimulated acid secretion in all subjects. The mean suppression was 76% and 84%, respectively, 3 to 5 hours after administration, and 25% and 30%, respectively, 8 to 10 hours after administration. In some subjects who received the 20 mg dose, however, the antisecretory effect was dissipated within 6 to 8 hours. There was no cumulative effect with repeated doses. The nocturnal intragastric pH was raised by evening doses of 20 mg and 40 mg of famotidine to mean values of 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. When famotidine was given after breakfast, the basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 mg or 40 mg of famotidine was raised to about 5.</p><p>Famotidine had little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin levels. Gastric emptying and exocrine pancreatic function were not affected by famotidine.</p><p>In clinical pharmacology studies, systemic effects of famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrine systems were not noted. Also, no anti-androgenic effects were noted. Serum hormone levels, including prolactin, cortisol, thyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>), and testosterone, were not altered after treatment with famotidine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Pharmacodynamics of famotidine, assessed by gastric pH, were evaluated in 5 pediatric patients 2 to 13 years of age using the sigmoid E<span class="Sub">max</span> model. These data suggest that the relationship between serum concentration of famotidine and gastric acid suppression is similar to that observed in adults (see Table 3).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Serum Concentrations of Famotidine Associated with Gastric Acid Reduction in Famotidine-Treated Pediatric and Adult Patients<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> Using the Sigmoid E<span class="Sub">max</span> model, serum concentrations of famotidine associated with 50% maximum gastric acid reduction are presented as means ± SD.</p><p>In a study examining the effect of famotidine on gastric pH and duration of acid suppression in pediatric patients, four pediatric patients ages 11 to 15 years of age using the oral formulation at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, maintained a gastric pH above 5 for 13.5 ± 1.8 hours.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
Famotidine is incompletely absorbed. The bioavailability of oral doses is 40 to 45%. Bioavailability may be slightly increased by food, or slightly decreased by antacids; however, these effects are of no clinical consequence.</p><p>Peak famotidine plasma levels occur in 1 to 3 hours. Plasma levels after multiple dosages are similar to those after single doses.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution </span></p><p>Fifteen to 20% of famotidine in plasma is protein bound.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Famotidine undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism. Twenty-five to 30% of an oral dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged compound. The only metabolite identified in humans is the S-oxide.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Famotidine has an elimination half-life of 2.5-3.5 hours. Famotidine is eliminated by renal (65 to 70%) and metabolic (30 to 35%) routes. Renal clearance is 250 to 450 mL/minute, indicating some tubular excretion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Bioavailability studies of 8 pediatric patients (11 to 15 years of age) showed a mean oral bioavailability of 0.5 compared to adult values of 0.42 to 0.49. Oral doses of 0.5 mg per kg achieved AUCs of 580 ± 60 ng•hr/mL in pediatric patients 11 to 15 years of age, compared to 482 ± 181 ng•hr/mL in adults treated with 40 mg orally.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>In adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute), the systemic exposure (AUC) of famotidine increased at least 5-fold. In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance between 30 to 60 mL/minute), the AUC of famotidine increased at least 2-fold <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Population (8.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Organic Anion Transporter (OAT) 1 and 3: In vitro</span> studies indicate that famotidine is a substrate for OAT1 and OAT3. Following coadministration of probenecid (1500 mg), an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3, with a single oral 20 mg dose of famotidine in 8 healthy subjects, the serum AUC<span class="Sub">0-10h</span> of famotidine increased from 424 to 768 ng•hr/mL and the maximum serum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max) increased from 73 to 113 ng/mL. Renal clearance, urinary excretion rate and amount of famotidine excreted unchanged in urine were decreased. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1 (MATE-1):</span> An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study showed that famotidine is an inhibitor of MATE-1. However, no clinically significant interaction with metformin, a substrate for MATE-1, was observed.</p><p><span class="Italics">CYP1A2:</span> Famotidine is a weak CYP1A2 inhibitor.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenic potential of famotidine was assessed in a 106-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats and a 92-week oral carcinogenicity study in mice. In the 106-week study in rats and the 92-week study in mice at oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 243 and 122 times, respectively, based on body surface area, the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day for the treatment of erosive esophagitis), there was no evidence of carcinogenic potential for famotidine.</p><p>Famotidine was negative in the microbial mutagen test (Ames test) using <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> with or without rat liver enzyme activation at concentrations up to 10,000 mcg/plate. In <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies in mice, with a micronucleus test and a chromosomal aberration test, no evidence of a mutagenic effect was observed.</p><p>In studies with rats given oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 243 times, based on body surface area, the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day) fertility and reproductive performance were not affected.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Active Duodenal Ulcer</h3><p class="First">In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind trial in adult outpatients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer (DU), orally administered famotidine was compared to placebo. As shown in Table 4, 70% of patients treated with famotidine 40 mg at bedtime were healed by Week 4. Most patients’ DU healed within 4 weeks.</p><p>Patients not healed by Week 4 were continued in the trial. By Week 8, 83% of patients treated with famotidine had healed DU, compared to 45% of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of DU healing with famotidine was greater than with placebo at each time point based on proportion of endoscopically confirmed healed DUs. Trials have not assessed the safety of famotidine in uncomplicated active DU for periods of more than 8 weeks.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Famotidine</span><br/>

Antacids were permitted during the trials, but consumption was not significantly different between the famotidine and placebo groups.</p><p>As shown in Table 5, the incidence of GU healing confirmed by endoscopy (dropouts counted as unhealed) with famotidine was greater than placebo at Weeks 6 and 8 in the U.S. trial, and at Weeks 4, 6 and 8 in the international trial. In these trials, most famotidine-treated patients healed within 6 weeks. Trials have not assessed the safety of famotidine in uncomplicated active GU for periods of more than 8 weeks.</p><p><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Famotidine</span><br/>

Healing was defined as complete resolution of all erosions visible with endoscopy. The U.S. trial comparing orally administered famotidine 40 mg twice daily to placebo and orally administered famotidine 20 mg twice daily showed a significantly greater percentage of healing of erosive esophagitis for famotidine 40 mg twice daily at Weeks 6 and 12 (Table 7).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Famotidine</span><br/>

These differences were statistically significant.</p><p>In the international trial, when orally administered famotidine 40 mg twice daily was compared to orally administered ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, a statistically significantly greater percentage of healing of erosive esophagitis was observed with famotidine 40 mg twice daily at Week 12 (Table 8). There was, however, no significant difference in symptom relief among treatment groups.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Famotidine</span><br/>

Orally administered famotidine dosages from 20 mg to 160 mg every 6 hours maintained basal acid secretion below 10 mEq/hour; initial dosages were titrated to the individual patient need and subsequent adjustments were necessary with time in some patients.</p><h3>Risk Reduction of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence</h3><p class="First">Two randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials in patients with endoscopically confirmed healed DUs demonstrated that patients receiving treatment with orally administered famotidine 20 mg at bedtime had lower rates of DU recurrence, as compared with placebo.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>In the U.S. trial, DU recurrence within 12 months was 2.4 times greater in patients treated with placebo than in the patients treated with famotidine. The 89 famotidine-treated patients had a cumulative observed DU recurrence rate of 23%, compared to a 57% in the 89 patients receiving placebo (p&lt;0.01).</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>In the international trial, the cumulative observed DU recurrence within 12 months in the 307 famotidine-treated patients was 36%, compared to 76% in the 325 patients who received placebo (p&lt;0.01).</li>
