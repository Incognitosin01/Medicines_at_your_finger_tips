It helps the skin renew itself. Benzoyl peroxide has an antibacterial effect. It also has a mild drying effect, which allows excess oils and dirt to be easily washed away from the skin.</p><p>Epiduo gel is used to treat acne vulgaris (severe acne) in people who are at least 9 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before using Epiduo gel, tell your doctor about all other medicated skin products you are using. Using more than one acne medication at a time could cause severe skin irritation.</p><p>Avoid getting Epiduo gel in your mouth, nose, or eyes, or on your lips. If it does get into any of these areas, rinse with water. Do not use Epiduo gel on sunburned, windburned, dry, chapped, irritated, or broken skin. Also avoid using Epiduo gel on wounds or on areas of eczema. Wait until these conditions have healed before using this medication.</p><p><b>Benzoyl peroxide can cause a rare but serious allergic reaction or severe skin irritation.</b> Stop using this medicine and get emergency medical help if you have: hives, itching; difficult breathing, feeling light-headed; or swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Avoid using skin products that can cause dryness or irritation, such as harsh soaps, shampoos, or skin cleansers, hair removers or waxes, or skin products with alcohol, spices, astringents, or lime.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Epiduo if you are allergic to adapalene (Differin) or benzoyl peroxide.</p><p>To make sure Epiduo is safe for you, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions.</p><p>It is not known whether Epiduo will harm an unborn baby.

Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Using more of this medicine or applying it more often than prescribed will not make it work any faster, and may increase side effects.</p><p><b>Benzoyl peroxide topical can cause a rare but serious allergic reaction or severe skin irritation.</b> Before you start using Epiduo gel, you may choose to apply a "test dose" to see if you have a reaction. Apply a very small amount of the medicine to 1 or 2 small acne areas every day for 3 days in a row. If there is no reaction, begin using the full prescribed amount on the 4th day.</p><p>Wash your hands before and after applying this medicine.</p><p>Epiduo is usually applied one time per day. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Clean and pat dry the skin to be treated. Use a pea-sized amount of the gel for each treatment area (chin, forehead, and each cheek). Apply the medicine in a thin layer and rub in gently.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse while using this medicine.</p><p>Do not apply any other skin products unless your doctor has told you to.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Acne:</b></p><p>Epiduo gel should be applied to affected areas of the face and/or trunk once daily after washing.
