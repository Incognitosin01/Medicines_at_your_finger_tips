Also see individual agents.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Xeroderma (2%)</p><p>Central nervous system: Localized burning (2%), paresthesia (2%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Cushing's syndrome (HPA axis suppression; children), dermal ulcer (rare), edema, growth suppression (children), pseudotumor cerebri (children), secondary infection, skin atrophy (children), skin rash, stinging of the skin</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.</p><p>• Kaposi sarcoma: Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids has been associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma (case reports); if noted, discontinuation of therapy should be considered (Goedert 2002).</p><p>• Ocular effects: Topical corticosteroids, including betamethasone, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Monitor for ocular changes. Avoid contact with eyes.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, prolonged use, or application to large surface areas.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Diaper dermatitis: Do not use for diaper dermatitis in any age group; adverse reactions associated with corticosteroids have occurred.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Use topical corticosteroids with caution in the elderly; skin atrophy and, rarely, skin ulcerations have been reported.</p><p>• Pediatric: Skin atrophy, including striae, has been reported with topical corticosteroid use in pediatric patients. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of corticosteroids after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing syndrome have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity and delay weight gain; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For topical use only; do not use intravaginally. Avoid contact with eyes or mouth. Do not use occlusive dressings; discontinue use if irritation occurs.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Growth (children and adolescents); signs/symptoms of HPA axis suppression/adrenal insufficiency; signs of skin infection; ocular changes</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use of this combination product in large amounts and use over prolonged periods of time should be avoided during pregnancy. Also see individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat fungal infections of the skin.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
