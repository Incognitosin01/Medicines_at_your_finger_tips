</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antianginal</p><p>Chemical Class: Nitrate</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Nitro-Dur 0.8</h2><p>Nitroglycerin ointment or skin patch is used to prevent angina (chest pain) caused by coronary artery disease. It does not work fast enough to relieve the pain of an angina attack that has already started.</p><p>Nitroglycerin belongs to the group of medicines called nitrates. It works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its work load. When used regularly on a long-term basis, this helps prevent angina attacks from occurring.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Nitro-Dur 0.8</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of nitroglycerin transdermal in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nitroglycerin transdermal in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have low blood pressure and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving nitroglycerin transdermal.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Nitro-Dur 0.8</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain nitroglycerin.  It may not be specific to Nitro-Dur 0.8. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. It will only work if applied correctly.</p><p>This form of nitrate is used to reduce the number of angina attacks over a long time. It will not relieve an attack that has already started because it works too slowly. The <i>ointment</i> and <i>patch</i> forms release medicine gradually to provide an effect for 7 to 10 hours. Check with your doctor if you also need a fast-acting medicine to relieve the pain of an angina attack.</p><p>You should use this medicine first thing in the morning and follow the same schedule each day. This medicine works best if you have a "drug-free" period of time every day when you do not use it. Your doctor will schedule your doses during the day to allow for a drug-free time. Follow the schedule of dosing carefully so the medicine will work properly.</p><p>This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow the instructions in the leaflet carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>For patients using the <i>ointment</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Before applying a new dose of ointment, remove any ointment remaining on the skin from a previous dose. This will allow the fresh ointment to release the nitroglycerin properly.</li>
<li>This medicine comes with papers to help measure the dose. Use them to measure the length of ointment squeezed from the tube and to apply the ointment to the skin. Do not rub or massage the ointment into the skin. Spread it in a thin, even layer, and cover an area of skin that is the same size each time it is applied.</li>
<li>Apply the ointment to skin with little or no hair that is free of scars, cuts, or irritation.</li>
<li>Apply each dose of ointment to a different area of skin to prevent irritation.</li>
<li>If your doctor has ordered an airtight covering or dressing (such as plastic kitchen wrap) be placed over this medicine, make sure you know how to apply it. Airtight dressings will increase the amount of medicine absorbed through the skin and may cause more side effects. Use them only as directed and check with your doctor if you have any questions about this.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the <i>patch system</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying a patch. Do not touch your eyes until after you have washed your hands.</li>
<li>Do not try to trim or cut the adhesive patch to adjust the dosage. Check with your doctor if you think the medicine is not working as it should.</li>
<li>Apply the patch to a clean, dry skin area with little or no hair that is free of scars, cuts, or irritation.</li>
<li>Always remove a previous patch before applying a new one.</li>
<li>Apply a new patch if the first one becomes loose or falls off.</li>
<li>Apply each patch to a different area to prevent skin irritation.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
