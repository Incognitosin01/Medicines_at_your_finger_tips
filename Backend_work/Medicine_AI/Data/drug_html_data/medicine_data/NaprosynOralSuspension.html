</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Naprosyn Oral Suspension</h2><p class="First">NAPROSYN (naproxen) Suspension is indicated for: the relief of the signs and symptoms of:</p><ul>
<li>rheumatoid arthritis</li>
<li>osteoarthritis</li>
<li>ankylosing spondylitis</li>
<li>polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis</li>
<li>tendonitis</li>
<li>bursitis</li>
<li>acute gout</li>
</ul><p>the management of:</p><ul>
<li>pain</li>
<li>primary dysmenorrhea</li>
</ul><h2>Naprosyn Oral Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Instructions</h3><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of NAPROSYN Suspension and other treatment options before deciding to use NAPROSYN Suspension. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>After observing the response to initial therapy with NAPROSYN Suspension, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs.</p><p>Always use a calibrated measuring device when administering NAPROSYN suspension to ensure the dose is measured and administered accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device, especially when one-half of a teaspoonful is to be measured. Given the variability of the household spoon measure, it is strongly recommended that caregivers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Health care providers should recommend an appropriate measuring device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage.</p><p>Naproxen-containing products such as NAPROSYN suspension, and other naproxen products should not be used concomitantly since they all circulate in the plasma as the naproxen anion.</p><h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of NAPROSYN suspension is shown in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Recommended dosages of NAPROSYN Suspension</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph">NAPROSYN Suspension</p><p class="First TableParagraph">250 mg (10 mL)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">twice daily</p><p class="First TableParagraph">or 375 mg (15 mL)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">twice daily</p><p class="First TableParagraph">or 500 mg (20 mL)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">twice daily</p><p>NAPROSYN Suspension should be shaken gently before use.</p><p>During long-term administration, the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and the administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily is not necessary.</p><p>The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in response.</p><p>In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg/day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk.</p><h3>Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</h3><p class="First">The use of NAPROSYN Suspension is recommended for juvenile arthritis in children 2 years or older because it allows for more flexible dose titration based on the child’s weight. In pediatric patients, doses of 5 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels of naproxen similar to those seen in adults taking 500 mg of naproxen [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses (i.e., 5 mg/kg given twice a day). A measuring cup marked in 1/2 teaspoon and 2.5 milliliter increments is provided with the NAPROSYN Suspension. The following table may be used as a guide for dosing of NAPROSYN Suspension:</p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">Patient’s Weight</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">Dose</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">Administered as</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph">13 kg (29 lb)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">62.5 mg twice daily</p><p class="First TableParagraph">2.5 mL (1/2 tsp) twice daily</p><p class="First TableParagraph">25 kg (55 lb)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">125 mg twice daily</p><p class="First TableParagraph">5.0 mL (1 tsp) twice daily</p><p class="First TableParagraph">38 kg (84 lb)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">187.5 mg twice daily</p><p class="First TableParagraph">7.5 mL (1 1/2 tsp) twice daily</p><h3>Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose of NAPROSYN Suspension is 500 mg (20 mL), followed by 250 mg (10 mL) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The total daily dose should not exceed 1250 mg (50 mL).</p><h3>Acute Gout</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose is 750 mg (30 mL) of NAPROSYN Suspension followed by 250 mg (10 mL) every 8 hours until the attack has subsided.</p><h3>Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Naproxen</h3><p class="First">Different dose strengths and formulations (e.g., tablets, suspension) of naproxen are not interchangeable. This difference should be taken into consideration when changing strengths or formulations.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">NAPROSYN Suspension: 125 mg/5 mL (contains 39 mg sodium): Available in 1 pint (473 mL) light- resistant bottles</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">NAPROSYN Suspension is contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul>
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to naproxen or any components of the drug product [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.7</span><span class="Italics">,</span><span class="Italics">5.9</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]</li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.7</span><span class="Italics">,</span><span class="Italics">5.8</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]</li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of NAPROSYN Suspension in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If NAPROSYN Suspension is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDS.</p><p>Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10­ fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:</span></p><ul>
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue NAPROSYN Suspension until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including naproxen.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flulike" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue NAPROSYN Suspension immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including NAPROSYN Suspension, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Avoid the use of NAPROSYN Suspension in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If NAPROSYN Suspension is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><p>Each 5 mL of NAPROSYN Suspension contains 39 mg of sodium. This should be considered in patients whose overall intake of sodium must be severely restricted.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of NAPROSYN Suspension in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of NAPROSYN Suspension may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating NAPROSYN Suspension. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of NAPROSYN Suspension [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]. Avoid the use of NAPROSYN Suspension in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If NAPROSYN Suspension is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span> <span class="Italics">and Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.8</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin- sensitive patients, NAPROSYN Suspension is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]. When NAPROSYN Suspension is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens- Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of NAPROSYN Suspension at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p><p>NAPROSYN Suspension is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [ <span class="Italics">see Contraindications</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Naproxen may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including NAPROSYN Suspension, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [ <span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with NAPROSYN Suspension has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including NAPROSYN Suspension, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ <span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of NAPROSYN Suspension in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Long-Term Use and Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10 g or less who are to receive long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically.</p><p>Because of adverse eye findings in animal studies with drugs of this class, it is recommended that ophthalmic studies be carried out if any change or disturbance in vision occurs.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials in 960 patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are listed below. In general, reactions in patients treated chronically were reported 2 to 10 times more frequently than they were in short-term studies in the 962 patients treated for mild to moderate pain or for dysmenorrhea. The most frequent complaints reported related to the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>A clinical study found gastrointestinal reactions to be more frequent and more severe in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking daily doses of 1500 mg naproxen compared to those taking 750 mg naproxen.</p><p>In controlled clinical trials with about 80 pediatric patients and in well-monitored, open-label studies with about 400 pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with naproxen, the incidence of rash and prolonged bleeding times were greater, the incidence of gastrointestinal and central nervous system reactions were about the same, and the incidence of other reactions were lower in pediatric patients than in adults.</p><p>In patients taking naproxen in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients are:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal (GI) Experiences, including</span>: heartburn*, abdominal pain*, nausea*, constipation*, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis</p><p><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System</span>: headache*, dizziness*, drowsiness*, lightheadedness, vertigo <span class="Bold">Dermatologic</span>: pruritus (itching)*, skin eruptions*, ecchymoses*, sweating, purpura <span class="Bold">Special Senses</span>: tinnitus*, visual disturbances, hearing disturbances</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular</span>: edema*, palpitations <span class="Bold">General</span>: dyspnea*, thirst</p><p>*Incidence of reported reaction between 3% and 9%. Those reactions occurring in less than 3% of the patients are unmarked.</p><p>In patients taking NSAIDs, the following adverse experiences have also been reported in approximately 1% to 10% of patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal (GI) Experiences, including</span>: flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal), vomiting</p><p><span class="Bold">General</span>: abnormal renal function, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, increased bleeding time, rashes</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of naproxen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The following are additional adverse experiences reported in &lt;1% of patients taking naproxen during clinical trials and through postmarketing reports.

Avoid use of NSAIDs, including NAPROSYN Suspension, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of NAPROSYN Suspension in pregnant women.</p><p>Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies in rats, rabbits, and mice no evidence of teratogenicity or fetal harm when naproxen was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses 0.13, 0.26, and 0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1500 mg/day, respectively. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as naproxen, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>There are no studies on the effects of NAPROSYN Suspension during labor or delivery.

Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation.</p><p>Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including NAPROSYN Suspension, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established. Pediatric dosing recommendations for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis are based on well-controlled studies. There are no adequate effectiveness or dose-response data for other pediatric conditions, but the experience in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other use experience have established that single doses of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg (as naproxen suspension), with total daily dose not exceeding 15 mg/kg/day, are well tolerated in pediatric patients over 2 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The hepatic and renal tolerability of long-term naproxen administration was studied in two double-blind clinical trials involving 586 patients. Of the patients studied, 98 patients were age 65 and older and 10 of the 98 patients were age 75 and older. Naproxen was administered at doses of 375 mg twice daily or 750 mg twice daily for up to 6 months. Transient abnormalities of laboratory tests assessing hepatic and renal function were noted in some patients, although there were no differences noted in the occurrence of abnormal values among different age groups.</p><p>Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.13</span><span class="Italics">)</span>] <span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear, although it is possible that the increase in free naproxen concentration could be associated with an increase in the rate of adverse events per a given dosage in some elderly patients. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.</p><p>Experience indicates that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to certain adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Elderly or debilitated patients seem to tolerate peptic ulceration or bleeding less well when these events do occur. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in the geriatric population [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Naproxen is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Geriatric patients may be at a greater risk for the development of a form of renal toxicity precipitated by reduced prostaglandin formation during administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in these patients.

Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare. A few patients have experienced convulsions, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">5.1,</span> <span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>Naprosyn Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">NAPROSYN Suspension (naproxen) is available as a light orange-colored opaque oral suspension containing 125 mg/5 mL of naproxen for oral administration.</p><p>Naproxen is a propionic acid derivative related to the arylacetic acid group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The chemical name is (S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid. The molecular weight is 230.26 Its molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">14</span>H <span class="Sub">14</span>O <span class="Sub">3</span>, and it has the following chemical structure.</p><p></p><p>Naproxen is an odorless, white to off-white crystalline substance. It is lipid-soluble, practically insoluble in water at low pH and freely soluble in water at high pH. The octanol/water partition coefficient of naproxen at pH 7.4 is 1.6 to 1.8.</p><p>The inactive ingredients in NAPROSYN Suspension include sucrose, magnesium aluminum silicate, sorbitol solution and sodium chloride (39 mg/5 mL, 1.5 mEq), methylparaben, fumaric acid, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, imitation pineapple flavor, imitation orange flavor and purified water. The pH of the suspension ranges from 2.2 to 3.7.</p><h2>Naprosyn Oral Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Naproxen has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of naproxen, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Naproxen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Naproxen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because naproxen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Naproxen is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo bioavailability of 95%. The elimination half-life of naproxen ranges from 12 to 17 hours. Steady-state levels of naproxen are reached in 4 to 5 days, and the degree of naproxen accumulation is consistent with this half-life.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Peak plasma levels of naproxen given as NAPROSYN Suspension are attained in 1 to 4 hours.</p><p>When NAPROSYN Suspension and immediate release naproxen tablets were given to fasted subjects (n=12) in a single-dose, crossover study, there were comparable pharmacokinetic parameters between the two formulations.</p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">NAPROSYN</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">Naproxen Tablets</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">Suspension</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph"><span class="Bold">500 mg</span></p><p class="First TableParagraph">C <span class="Sub">max</span> (µg/mL)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">64.3</p><p class="First TableParagraph">71.1</p><p class="First TableParagraph">T <span class="Sub">max</span> (hours)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">2.6</p><p class="First TableParagraph">2.3</p><p class="First TableParagraph">T <span class="Sub">1/2</span> (hours)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">16.8</p><p class="First TableParagraph">16.3</p><p class="First TableParagraph">AUC <span class="Sub">0–t</span> (µg·hr/mL)</p><p class="First TableParagraph">1249</p><p class="First TableParagraph">1218</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Naproxen has a volume of distribution of 0.16 L/kg. At therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin- bound. At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day there is less than proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses (average trough Css 36.5, 49.2 and 56.4 mg/L with 500, 1000 and 1500 mg daily doses of naproxen, respectively).

Approximately 95% of the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen (&lt;1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (&lt;1%) or their conjugates (66% to 92%). The plasma half-life of the naproxen anion in humans ranges from 12 to 17 hours. The corresponding half-lives of both naproxen’s metabolites and conjugates are shorter than 12 hours, and their rates of excretion have been found to coincide closely with the rate of naproxen clearance from the plasma. Small amounts, 3% or less of the administered dose, are excreted in the feces. In patients with renal failure metabolites may accumulate [ <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric</span></p><p>In pediatric patients aged 5 to 16 years with arthritis, plasma naproxen levels following a 5 mg/kg single dose of naproxen suspension [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)</span>] were found to be similar to those found in normal adults following a 500 mg dose. The terminal half-life appears to be similar in pediatric and adult patients.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies of naproxen were not performed in pediatric patients younger than 5 years of age. Pharmacokinetic parameters appear to be similar following administration of NAPROSYN suspension or tablets in pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric</span></p><p>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly, although the unbound fraction is &lt;1% of the total naproxen concentration. Unbound trough naproxen concentrations in elderly subjects have been reported to range from 0.12% to 0.19% of total naproxen concentration, compared with 0.05% to 0.075% in younger subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Naproxen pharmacokinetics has not been determined in subjects with hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>Chronic alcoholic liver disease and probably other diseases with decreased or abnormal plasma proteins (albumin) reduce the total plasma concentration of naproxen, but the plasma concentration of unbound naproxen is increased.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Naproxen pharmacokinetics has not been determined in subjects with renal insufficiency. Given that naproxen, its metabolites and conjugates are primarily excreted by the kidney, the potential exists for naproxen metabolites to accumulate in the presence of renal insufficiency. Elimination of naproxen is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin</span></p><p>When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered.

No evidence of tumorigenicity was found.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Naproxen tested positive in the in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay for but was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test).</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Male rats were treated with 2, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg naproxen by oral gavage for 60 days prior to mating and female rats were treated with the same doses for 14 days prior to mating and for the first 7 days of pregnancy. There were no adverse effects on fertility noted (up to 0.13 times the MRDH based on body surface area).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Naproxen has been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendonitis and bursitis, and acute gout. Improvement in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time. Generally, response to naproxen has not been found to be dependent on age, sex, severity or duration of rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease.</p><p>In a clinical trial comparing standard formulations of naproxen 375 mg twice a day (750 mg a day) vs 750 mg twice a day (1500 mg/day), 9 patients in the 750 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Nineteen patients in the 1500 mg group terminated prematurely because of adverse events. Most of these adverse events were gastrointestinal events.</p><p>In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, naproxen has been shown to be comparable to aspirin and indomethacin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but the frequency and severity of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, dyspepsia, heartburn) and nervous system adverse effects (tinnitus, dizziness, lightheadedness) were less in naproxen-treated patients than in those treated with aspirin or indomethacin.</p><p>In patients with ankylosing spondylitis, naproxen has been shown to decrease night pain, morning stiffness and pain at rest. In double-blind studies the drug was shown to be as effective as aspirin, but with fewer side effects.</p><p>In patients with acute gout, a favorable response to naproxen was shown by significant clearing of inflammatory changes (e.g., decrease in swelling, heat) within 24 to 48 hours, as well as by relief of pain and tenderness.</p><p>Naproxen has been studied in patients with mild to moderate pain secondary to postoperative, orthopedic, postpartum episiotomy and uterine contraction pain and dysmenorrhea. Onset of pain relief can begin within 1 hour in patients taking naproxen. Analgesic effect was shown by such measures as reduction of pain intensity scores, increase in pain relief scores, decrease in numbers of patients requiring additional analgesic medication, and delay in time to remedication. The analgesic effect has been found to last for up to 12 hours.</p><p>Naproxen may be used safely in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids; however, in controlled clinical trials, when added to the regimen of patients receiving corticosteroids, it did not appear to cause greater improvement over that seen with corticosteroids alone. Whether naproxen has a “steroid-sparing” effect has not been adequately studied. When added to the regimen of patients receiving gold salts, naproxen did result in greater improvement. Its use in combination with salicylates is not recommended because there is evidence that aspirin increases the rate of excretion of naproxen and data are inadequate to demonstrate that naproxen and aspirin produce greater improvement over that achieved with aspirin alone. In addition, as with other NSAIDs, the combination may result in higher frequency of adverse events than demonstrated for either product alone.</p><p>In <span class="Sup">51</span>Cr blood loss and gastroscopy studies with normal volunteers, daily administration of 1000 mg of NAPROSYN has been demonstrated to cause statistically significantly less gastric bleeding and erosion than 3250 mg of aspirin.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">NAPROSYN Suspension: 125 mg/5 mL (contains 39 mg sodium): Available in 1 pint (473 mL) light-resistant bottles</p><p>NDC – 71511-701-16</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° - 30°C (59° - 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature] Avoid excessive heat above 40°C (104°F).
