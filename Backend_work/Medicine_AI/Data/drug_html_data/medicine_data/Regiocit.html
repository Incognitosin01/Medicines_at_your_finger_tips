Regiocit has been authorized for emergency use as a replacement solution in adult patients treated with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT), and for whom RCA is appropriate, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regiocit is intended for use in a critical care setting. Regiocit is intended to be used in continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) modalities. Use of Regiocit is limited to healthcare providers and/or institutions that Baxter has qualified to administer Regiocit for these emergency uses.</p><p>Regiocit has been authorized by FDA for emergency use. Regiocit is not FDA-approved.</p><p>Regiocit is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of Regiocit under section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.</p><p>The scope of the EUA is as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">Product Description</span></p><p>Regiocit is a sterile, replacement solution intended for use in adult patients being treated with CRRT and for whom RCA is appropriate. Regiocit, contains physiological concentrations of sodium (140 mmol/l), chloride (86 mmol/l), and a low concentration of citrate (18 mmol/L).</p><p class="First">• <span class="Bold">A separate systemic infusion of calcium must be administered during use of Regiocit to prevent or treat hypocalcemia. Blood calcium concentrations (ionized and total) must be monitored throughout CRRT.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">• Regiocit solution must be used in pre-dilution mode only, with appropriate extracorporeal renal replacement equipment intended for CRRT, using an integrated pre-blood pump for RCA and in combination with other replacement and/or dialysate solution to provide the recommended dose of CRRT.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">• Regiocit may only be administered by health care providers/institutions that have been qualified by Baxter to administer the product.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Instructions for Use</span></p><h3>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h3><p class="First">Renal Replacement Solution: Not for direct intravenous infusion.</p><p>The recommended effluent volume for patients receiving CRRT for acute kidney injury (AKI) is 20 to 25 mL/kg/h. This usually requires a higher prescription of effluent volume. The prescription of Regiocit solution must consider the flow rates of the effluent and other therapeutic fluids, the patient’s fluid removal requirements, additional fluid inputs and outputs, and the desired acid-base and electrolyte balance.</p><p>The mode of therapy, solute formulations, flow rates and length of therapy should be selected by the physician responsible for managing treatment depending on the clinical condition of the patient as well as the patient’s fluid, electrolyte, acid base and glucose balance.</p><p>Dialysate and replacement fluid formulations and flow rates are prescribed in accordance with the patient’s clinical needs. The use of a calcium-containing dialysate or replacement fluid is not recommended, since the calcium provided by these solutions may counteract the anticoagulant effect of citrate in the circuit.</p><p class="First">The rate at which Regiocit solution is administered depends on the targeted citrate dose and the prescribed blood flow rate. The pre-filter infusion rate of Regiocit solution is indexed to the blood flow rate to achieve a target blood citrate concentration of 3 mmol/L of blood (See Table 1). Flow rate for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit should be titrated to achieve a post-filter concentration of ionized calcium in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Regiocit Solution Flow Rates to Achieve Citrate Dose of 3 mmol/L of Blood</span></p><p>Prior to initiating therapy, the patient’s systemic ionized calcium concentration should be within the normal physiologic range (1.0 to 1.2 mmol/L) by adjustment of calcium supplementation. A separate infusion of calcium is always required during use of Regiocit, due to loss in the effluent. Calcium solution infusion is commenced at the rate of 4 mmol/h, when commencing therapy (see Table 4). Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to physician’s prescription when Regiocit is stopped.</p><p>Citrate also acts as a buffer source (due to conversion to bicarbonate); the infusion rate of Regiocit solution must be considered in relation to the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources (e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid). Regiocit solution must be used together with a dialysis solution/replacement solution with appropriate bicarbonate concentration.</p><p class="First">Monitoring of the post-filter blood ionized calcium (iCa), systemic blood iCa, and total blood calcium levels in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters such as acid-base balance and serum electrolytes are essential to guide appropriate Regiocit solution dosage based on the desired level of anticoagulation. Levels should be taken at baseline, 1 hour after initiation (or adjustment), and every 6 hours (See Table 2). Rapidly decreasing systemic ionized calcium levels are an early indicator of citrate accumulation.</p><p>Measurement of total calcium and assessment of total-to-ionized calcium ratio is necessary. Citrate accumulation causes systemic ionized calcium levels to drop and the ratio of total-to-ionized calcium increases (total-to-ionized calcium ratio &gt; 2.5). In the presence of impaired citrate metabolism, a progressively higher calcium infusion rate is required to maintain the systemic ionized calcium concentration within the intended target. When a total-to-ionized-calcium ratio &gt; 2.5 is recorded, any one of the following abnormalities reported concurrently increases the likelihood of citrate accumulation:</p><p>In order to avoid metabolic alkalosis, acid-base balance and systemic ionized calcium can be measured using blood gas analysis. If metabolic alkalosis or citrate accumulation is suspected, decrease the citrate dose while tolerating a post-filter ionized calcium of &lt; 0.5 mmol/L. This can be achieved by either decreasing the blood flow rate to decrease the overall citrate load, increasing the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) to increase the citrate removal, or decreasing the citrate flow to decrease the citrate dose. Dialysate solutions contain bicarbonate below or above physiological range of 22 to 26 mmol/L, and increasing or decreasing the flow rates of the dialysate solutions can impact the acid-base status of the patient.</p><p>Plasma levels of sodium, magnesium, potassium, and glucose, and phosphate should be monitored regularly and should be supplemented as needed.</p><p>Table 2 provides a summary of the most important parameters to be monitored during RCA therapy, as well as options for adjustment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Monitoring and Adjustment During RCA Therapy</span></p><p>Table 3 provides the Regiocit solution flow rate adjustment based on a citrate dose adjustment of 0.5 mmol/L.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Regiocit Solution Flowrate Adjustment Based on a Citrate Dose Adjustment of 0.5 mmol/L</span></p><p>Table 4 provides recommendations to maintain a systemic ionized calcium level between 1.0 mmol/L and 1.2 mmol/L.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Sliding Scale of Calcium Infusion</span></p><h3>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h3><p class="First">Regiocit solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation. Calcium</p><p>reinfusion is required during use of Regiocit and blood calcium concentrations (ionized and total) must be monitored.</p><p class="First">Regiocit solution contains no magnesium. Use of the Regiocit solution may result in hypomagnesemia due to CRRT effluent losses. Magnesium levels must be monitored as infusion of magnesium may be necessary.</p><p class="First">Regiocit solution contains no dextrose. Administration of Regiocit solution may lead to hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels must be monitored regularly.</p><p class="First">Regiocit solution contains no potassium. The serum potassium concentration must be monitored before and during CRRT.</p><p class="First">Regiocit solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Metabolization of 1 mol of citrate generates 3 mol of bicarbonate. Additional sodium bicarbonate (or buffer source) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance. If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) or change the composition of the CRRT solution.</p><p class="First">Metabolic acidosis may occur if metabolic clearance of citrate by the liver or skeletal muscle is impaired. If citrate accumulation develops and/or metabolic acidosis develops or worsens during therapy with Regiocit solution, the infusion rate may need to be decreased or its administration stopped.</p><p class="First">Metabolism of citrate (to bicarbonate) may be impaired in patients with hepatic impairment, resulting in accumulation of citrate. If Regiocit solution is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid–base imbalance.</p><p class="First">Regiocit solution is hypoosmolar/hypotonic relative to standard CRRT replacement fluids and should be used with caution in patients with traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, or increased intracranial pressure.</p><h3>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h3><p class="First">Contraindications for the use of Regiocit include:</p><p class="First">Report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of this product.</p><p>Healthcare facilities and prescribing health care providers or their designee receiving Regiocit will track all medication errors associated with the use of and all serious adverse events that are considered to be potentially attributable to Regiocit use and must report these to FDA using one of the following methods:</p><p>Call 1-800-FDA-1088 for questions.

In these circumstances, more frequent monitoring of citrate accumulation should be undertaken. With systemic citrate accumulation, metabolic acidosis and ionized hypocalcemia may ensue, and the ratio of total to ionized calcium in the blood rises.

These adverse events were generally transient and reversible. Metabolic alkalosis was seen in 6% of patients treated with RCA, compared to none treated with UFH, and metabolic acidosis was reported in 6% and 2% of patients in the RCA and UFH groups, respectively. Six patients treated with RCA experienced severe hypocalcemia, compared to one patient treated with UFH.</p><p>In a second hemodiafiltration trial which evaluated 19 patients randomised to an equimolar solution of citrate, sodium and chloride, as contained in Regiocit solution, and 11 patients randomised to UFH anticoagulation, Hypocalcemia requiring intervention was reported in 3 patients treated with RCA, with 2 of these patients requiring treatment interruption of RCA.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-Market Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>To date, adverse events reported in the post-marketing setting for Regiocit appear to be consistent with those listed above in Adverse Reaction Overview.</p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Overview</span></p><p>The blood concentration of filterable/dialyzable drugs may be reduced during treatment due to their removal by the extracorporeal filter. Corresponding corrective therapy should be instituted if necessary to establish the desired blood concentrations for drugs removed during treatment. Patient monitoring at an appropriate frequency is required.</p><p>When prescribing Regiocit, the physician needs to consider the use of other anticoagulants along with other buffer-containing and electrolyte solutions (including CRRT replacement fluid and dialysate).</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p><p>The drugs listed in this table are based on either drug interaction case studies or clinical trials, or potential interactions due to the expected magnitude and seriousness of the interaction (i.e., those identified as contraindicated).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3 - Established or Potential Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p><h3>ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Citrate provides regional anticoagulation of blood in the continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) extracorporeal circuit by binding calcium and rendering calcium unavailable to the clotting cascade. Several steps of the clotting cascade are dependent on calcium and the absence of calcium prevents clotting in the circuit.</p><p>During CRRT, pre-dilution infusion of citrate into the access line of the extracorporeal circuit provides only regional extracorporeal anticoagulation (and thus avoids systemic anticoagulation of the patient) for two reasons. First, once blood from the extracorporeal circuit is returned to the patient, it mixes with the central venous blood which contains calcium. The second way in which a systemic anticoagulant effect is avoided is by infusion of calcium in the post-filter (return) bloodline of the extracorporeal circuit.</p><p>This procedure not only helps neutralize citrate’s anticoagulant effect in the patient’s blood, but also prevents any depletion of the patient’s calcium stores which may result from the loss of calcium (bound to citrate) in the CRRT effluent fluid.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></p><p>Citrate provides anticoagulation by its ability to form complexes with ionized calcium, making it unavailable to the clotting cascade. In Regiocit, sodium concentration has been set to 140 mmol/l as critically ill patients may develop severe hyponatremia. Chloride is set to the level required to balance cations as the solution is hydrogen carbonate free. Sodium and chloride are normal constituents of the human body and are considered to be pharmacologically inactive. Citrate is a normal metabolite in the human body that acts as a first intermediate substance in the Krebs cycle. Regiocit does not contain potassium or glucose.</p><p>Two studies provide information on the dose/response relationship between citrate concentration and anticoagulation. In one study, <span class="Italics">ex-vivo</span> anticoagulation with anticoagulant citrate dextrose formula A (ACD-A) in blood collected from six healthy volunteers was studied. The study concluded that the clinically relevant effects of citrate anticoagulation rely solely on the disturbed formation of the calcium-dependent coagulation factors complexes. In this study, the anticoagulation effects of citrate were monitored either by methods that quantify clot formation (i.e., activated clotting time) or by direct assessment of ionized calcium levels.</p><p>The correlation between concentrations of ionized calcium and clotting times revealed almost no anticoagulant effect when ionized calcium levels were up to or above 0.50 mmol/L, while clotting times showed a steep increase when calcium levels were decreased below 0.50 mmol/L. With respect to maximum effect, 5.65 mmol/L citrate induced clotting times of infinity in all samples.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>Citrate is a normal metabolite in the human body and an intermediate substance in the Krebs cycle. This physiological pathway is capable of processing high amounts of citric acid as long as it occurs at low concentrations. The Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondria, and all cells that contain these cellular organelles can metabolize citrate. Tissues rich in mitochondria such as liver, skeletal muscles, and kidney therefore have a higher capacity for citrate generation and elimination.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span> Absorption of sodium and chloride is determined by the patient’s clinical condition, metabolic status, and residual renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> Extracellular citrate can be transported from the blood across the plasma membrane by a group of proteins i.e. the plasma membrane citrate transporters (PMCTs) into the cells and then metabolized in various organs and tissues.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span> Citrate is an intermediate in the central metabolic pathway called Krebs cycle as mentioned above. Citrate is rapidly metabolized mainly in the liver, but can also be metabolized by other organs/tissues.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination:</span> Any excess of circulating citrate is normally excreted via the kidneys.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations and Conditions</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Insufficiency:</span></span></p><p>When treating decompensated cirrhosis patients, one should also consider:</p><h3>STORAGE, STABILITY AND DISPOSAL</h3><p class="First">Store at 4 °C to 30 °C.
