It is also needed by other people who might come into contact with the yellow fever virus.</p><p>Pregnant women should be vaccinated only if they must travel to areas where there is an epidemic of yellow fever and they cannot be protected from mosquito bites.</p><p>The certificate of vaccination for yellow fever is valid for 10 years beginning 10 days after the first vaccination, or on the date of the second vaccination if within 10 years of the first injection.</p><p>Yellow fever vaccine may not protect all persons given the vaccine.</p><p>This vaccine is given only at authorized Yellow Fever Vaccination Centers.
