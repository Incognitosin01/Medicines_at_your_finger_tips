Acitretin also must not be used by females who may not use reliable contraception while undergoing treatment and for at least 3 years following discontinuation of treatment. Acitretin is a metabolite of etretinate (TEGISON), and major human fetal abnormalities have been reported with the administration of acitretin and etretinate. Potentially, any fetus exposed can be affected.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical evidence has shown that concurrent ingestion of acitretin and ethanol has been associated with the formation of etretinate, which has a significantly longer elimination half-life than acitretin. Because the longer elimination half-life of etretinate would increase the duration of teratogenic potential for female patients, ethanol must not be ingested by female patients of childbearing potential either during treatment with acitretin or for 2 months after cessation of therapy. This allows for elimination of acitretin, thus removing the substrate for transesterification to etretinate. The mechanism of the metabolic process for conversion of acitretin to etretinate has not been fully defined. It is not known whether substances other than ethanol are associated with transesterification.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Acitretin has been shown to be embryotoxic and/or teratogenic in rabbits, mice, and rats at oral doses of 0.6, 3, and 15 mg per kg, respectively.

<li><span class="Bold">Must have had 2 negative urine or serum pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU per mL before receiving the initial prescription for acitretin. The first test (a screening test) is obtained by the prescriber when the decision is made to pursue therapy with acitretin. The second pregnancy test (a confirmation test) should be done during the first 5 days of the menstrual period immediately preceding the beginning of therapy with acitretin. For patients with amenorrhea, the second test should be done at least 11 days after the last act of unprotected sexual intercourse (without using 2 effective forms of contraception [birth control] simultaneously). If the second pregnancy test is negative, initiation of treatment with acitretin should begin within 7 days of the specimen collection. Acitretin should be limited to a monthly supply.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Must have a pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU per mL repeated every month during treatment with acitretin. The patient must have a negative result from a urine or serum pregnancy test before receiving a prescription for acitretin. To encourage compliance with this recommendation, a monthly supply of the drug should be prescribed. For at least 3 years after discontinuing therapy with acitretin, a pregnancy test must be repeated every 3 months.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Must have selected and have committed to use 2 effective forms of contraception (birth control) simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form, unless absolute abstinence is the chosen method, or the patient has undergone a hysterectomy or is clearly postmenopausal.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Patients must use 2 effective forms of contraception (birth control) simultaneously for at least 1 month prior to initiation of therapy with acitretin, during therapy with acitretin, and for at least 3 years after discontinuing therapy with acitretin. A Contraception Counseling Referral Form is available so that patients can receive an initial free contraception counseling session and pregnancy testing. Counseling about contraception and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy must be repeated on a monthly basis by the prescriber during therapy with acitretin and every 3 months for at least 3 years following discontinuation of acitretin.</span></li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Effective forms of contraception include both primary and secondary forms of contraception. Primary forms of contraception include: tubal ligation, partner’s vasectomy, intrauterine devices, birth control pills, and injectable/implantable/insertable/topical hormonal birth control products. Secondary forms of contraception include condoms (with or without spermicide), diaphragms and cervical caps (which must be used with a spermicide), and vaginal sponges (contains spermicide).</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Any birth control method can fail. Therefore, it is critically important that women of childbearing potential use 2 effective forms of contraception (birth control) simultaneously. It has not been established if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between acitretin and combined oral contraceptives. However, it has been established that acitretin interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed progestin preparations.<span class="Sup">1</span> Microdosed “minipill” progestin preparations are not recommended for use with acitretin. <span class="Italics">It is not known whether other progestin-only contraceptives, such as implants and injectables, are adequate methods of contraception during acitretin therapy.</span> Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of any medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products. Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John’s wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John’s wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John’s wort (see PRECAUTIONS).</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Must have signed a Patient Agreement/Informed Consent for Female Patients that contains warnings about the risk of potential birth defects if the fetus is exposed to acitretin, about contraceptive failure, about the fact that they must not ingest beverages or products containing ethanol while taking acitretin and for 2 months after treatment with acitretin has been discontinued, and about preventing pregnancy while taking acitretin and for at least 3 years after discontinuing acitretin.</span> <span class="Bold"><br/>
If pregnancy does occur during therapy with acitretin or at any time for at least 3 years following discontinuation of acitretin, the prescriber and patient should discuss the possible effects on the pregnancy. The available information is as follows:</span> <span class="Bold"><br/>
Acitretin, the active metabolite of etretinate, is teratogenic and is contraindicated during pregnancy. The risk of severe fetal malformations is well established when systemic retinoids are taken during pregnancy. Pregnancy must also be prevented after stopping acitretin therapy, while the drug is being eliminated to below a threshold blood concentration that would be associated with an increased incidence of birth defects. Because this threshold has not been established for acitretin in humans and because elimination rates vary among patients, the duration of posttherapy contraception to achieve adequate elimination cannot be calculated precisely. It is strongly recommended that contraception be continued for at least 3 years after stopping treatment with acitretin, based on the following considerations:</span>
<ul class="Circle">
<li><span class="Bold">In the absence of transesterification to form etretinate, greater than 98% of the acitretin would be eliminated within 2 months, assuming a mean elimination half-life of 49 hours.</span></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Severe birth defects have been reported where conception occurred during the time interval when the patient was being treated with acitretin and/or etretinate. In addition, severe birth defects have also been reported when conception occurred after the mother completed therapy. These cases have been reported both prospectively (before the outcome was known) and retrospectively (after the outcome was known). The events below are listed without distinction as to whether the reported birth defects are consistent with retinoid-induced embryopathy or not.</span><br/>
♦ <span class="Bold">There have been 318 prospectively reported cases involving pregnancies and the use of etretinate, acitretin, or both. In 238 of these cases, the conception occurred after the last dose of etretinate (103 cases), acitretin (126), or both (9). Fetal outcome remained unknown in approximately one-half of these cases, of which 62 were terminated and 14 were spontaneous abortions. Fetal outcome is known for the other 118 cases and 15 of the outcomes were abnormal (including cases of absent hand/wrist, clubfoot, GI malformation, hypocalcemia, hypotonia, limb malformation, neonatal apnea/anemia, neonatal ichthyosis, placental disorder/death, undescended testicle, and 5 cases of premature birth). In the 126 prospectively reported cases where conception occurred after the last dose of acitretin only, 43 cases involved conception at least 1 year but less than 2 years after the last dose. There were 3 reports of abnormal outcomes out of these 43 cases (involving limb malformation, GI tract malformations, and premature birth). There were only 4 cases where conception occurred at least 2 years after the last dose but there were no reports of birth defects in these cases.</span><br/>
♦ <span class="Bold">There is also a total of 35 retrospectively reported cases where conception occurred at least 1 year after the last dose of etretinate, acitretin, or both. From these cases there are 3 reports of birth defects when the conception occurred at least 1 year but less than 2 years after the last dose of acitretin (including heart malformations, Turner’s Syndrome, and unspecified congenital malformations) and 4 reports of birth defects when conception occurred 2 or more years after the last dose of acitretin (including foot malformation, cardiac malformations [2 cases], and unspecified neonatal and infancy disorder). There were 3 additional abnormal outcomes in cases where conception occurred 2 or more years after the last dose of etretinate (including chromosome disorder, forearm aplasia, and stillbirth).</span><br/>
♦ <span class="Bold">Females who have taken TEGISON (etretinate) must continue to follow the contraceptive recommendations for TEGISON. TEGISON is no longer marketed in the U.S.; for information, call 1-888-838-2872.</span><br/>
♦ <span class="Bold">Patients should not donate blood during and for at least 3 years following the completion of therapy with acitretin because women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with acitretin.</span></li>

<li><span class="Bold">Samples of seminal fluid from 3 male patients treated with acitretin and 6 male patients treated with etretinate have been assayed for the presence of acitretin.

Assuming an ejaculate volume of 10 mL, the amount of drug transferred in semen would be 125 ng, which is 1/200,000 of a single 25-mg capsule. Thus, although it appears that residual acitretin in seminal fluid poses little, if any, risk to a fetus while a male patient is taking the drug or after it is discontinued, the no-effect limit for teratogenicity is unknown and there is no registry for birth defects associated with acitretin.

For this reason, acitretin was given with food in all of the following trials. After administration of a single 50-mg oral dose of acitretin to 18 healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 196 to 728 ng per mL (mean: 416 ng per mL) and were achieved in 2 to 5 hours (mean: 2.7 hours). The oral absorption of acitretin is linear and proportional with increasing doses from 25 to 100 mg. Approximately 72% (range: 47% to 109%) of the administered dose was absorbed after a single 50-mg dose of acitretin was given to 12 healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Acitretin is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span> (See <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions</span>, <span class="Italics">Ethanol</span>.)</p><p>Following oral absorption, acitretin undergoes extensive metabolism and interconversion by simple isomerization to its 13-cis form (cis-acitretin). The formation of cis-acitretin relative to parent compound is not altered by dose or fed/fast conditions of oral administration of acitretin. Both parent compound and isomer are further metabolized into chain-shortened breakdown products and conjugates, which are excreted. Following multiple-dose administration of acitretin, steady-state concentrations of acitretin and cis-acitretin in plasma are achieved within approximately 3 weeks.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>The chain-shortened metabolites and conjugates of acitretin and cis-acitretin are ultimately excreted in the feces (34% to 54%) and urine (16% to 53%). The terminal elimination half-life of acitretin following multiple-dose administration is 49 hours (range: 33 to 96 hours), and that of cis-acitretin under the same conditions is 63 hours (range: 28 to 157 hours). The accumulation ratio of the parent compound is 1.2; that of cis-acitretin is 6.6.</p><h3>Special Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Psoriasis</span></p><p>In an 8-week trial of acitretin pharmacokinetics in subjects with psoriasis, mean steady-state trough concentrations of acitretin increased in a dose-proportional manner with dosages ranging from 10 to 50 mg daily. Acitretin plasma concentrations were nonmeasurable (&lt; 4 ng per mL) in all subjects 3 weeks after cessation of therapy.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elderly</span></p><p>In a multiple-dose trial in healthy young (n = 6) and elderly (n = 8) subjects, a 2-fold increase in acitretin plasma concentrations were seen in elderly subjects, although the elimination half-life did not change.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Failure</span></p><p>Plasma concentrations of acitretin were significantly (59.3%) lower in subjects with end-stage renal failure (n = 6) when compared with age-matched controls, following single 50-mg oral doses. Acitretin was not removed by hemodialysis in these subjects.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(See also boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions)</span></p><p>In studies of <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> pharmacokinetic drug interactions, no interaction was seen between acitretin and cimetidine, digoxin, phenprocoumon, or glyburide.</p><p><span class="Italics">Ethanol</span></p><p>Clinical evidence has shown that etretinate (a retinoid with a much longer half-life, see below) can be formed with concurrent ingestion of acitretin and ethanol. In a 2-way crossover trial, all 10 subjects formed etretinate with concurrent ingestion of a single 100-mg oral dose of acitretin during a 3-hour period of ethanol ingestion (total ethanol, approximately 1.4 g per kg body weight). A mean peak etretinate concentration of 59 ng per mL (range: 22 to 105 ng per mL) was observed, and extrapolation of AUC values indicated that the formation of etretinate in this trial was comparable to a single 5-mg oral dose of etretinate. There was no detectable formation of etretinate when a single 100-mg oral dose of acitretin was administered without concurrent ethanol ingestion, although the formation of etretinate without concurrent ethanol ingestion cannot be excluded (see boxed <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS</span>). Of 93 evaluable psoriatic subjects on acitretin therapy in several foreign trials (10 to 80 mg per day), 16% had measurable etretinate levels (&gt;5 ng per mL).</p><p>Etretinate has a much longer elimination half-life compared with that of acitretin. In one trial the apparent mean terminal half-life after 6 months of therapy was approximately 120 days (range: 84 to 168 days). In another trial of 47 subjects treated chronically with etretinate, 5 had detectable serum drug levels (in the range of 0.5 to 12 ng per mL) 2.1 to 2.9 years after therapy was discontinued. The long half-life appears to be due to storage of etretinate in adipose tissue.</p><p><span class="Italics">Progestin-only Contraceptives</span></p><p>It has not been established if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between acitretin and combined oral contraceptives.

Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, Acitretin Capsules should be prescribed only by those knowledgeable in the systemic use of retinoids. In females of reproductive potential, Acitretin Capsules should be reserved for non-pregnant patients who are unresponsive to other therapies or whose clinical condition contraindicates the use of other treatments (see boxed <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span></span>— Acitretin Capsules can cause severe birth defects).</p><p>Most patients experience relapse of psoriasis after discontinuing therapy. Subsequent courses, when clinically indicated, have produced efficacy results similar to the initial course of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category X</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(See boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS.)</span></p><p>Acitretin is contraindicated in patients with severely impaired liver or kidney function and in patients with chronic abnormally elevated blood lipid values (see boxed <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity</span>; WARNIN<span class="Bold">GS</span>, <span class="Bold">Lipids and Possible Cardiovascular Effects</span>;</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p>An increased risk of hepatitis has been reported to result from combined use of methotrexate and etretinate. Consequently, the combination of methotrexate with acitretin is also contraindicated (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p>Since both acitretin and tetracyclines can cause increased intracranial pressure, their combined use is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, Pseudotumor Cerebri</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Acitretin is contraindicated in cases of hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, urticaria) to the preparation (acitretin or excipients) or to other retinoids.</span></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(See also boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS.)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Of the 525 subjects treated in U.S. clinical trials, 2 had clinical jaundice with elevated serum bilirubin and transaminases considered related to treatment with acitretin. Liver function test results in these subjects returned to normal after acitretin was discontinued. Two of the 1,289 subjects treated in European clinical trials developed biopsy-confirmed toxic hepatitis. A second biopsy in one of these subjects revealed nodule formation suggestive of cirrhosis. One subject in a Canadian clinical trial of 63 subjects developed a 3-fold increase of transaminases. A liver biopsy of this subject showed mild lobular disarray, multifocal hepatocyte loss, and mild triaditis of the portal tracts compatible with acute reversible hepatic injury. The subject’s transaminase levels returned to normal 2 months after acitretin was discontinued.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">The potential of therapy with acitretin to induce hepatotoxicity was prospectively evaluated using liver biopsies in an open-label trial of 128 subjects. Pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies were available for 87 subjects. A comparison of liver biopsy findings before and after therapy revealed 49 (58%) subjects showed no change, 21 (25%) improved, and 14 (17%) subjects had a worsening of their liver biopsy status. For 6 subjects, the classification changed from class 0 (no pathology) to class I (normal fatty infiltration; nuclear variability and portal inflammation; both mild); for 7 subjects, the change was from class I to class II (fatty infiltration, nuclear variability, portal inflammation, and focal necrosis; all moderate to severe); and for 1 subject, the change was from class II to class IIIb (fibrosis, moderate to severe). No correlation could be found between liver function test result abnormalities and the change in liver biopsy status, and no cumulative dose relationship was found.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elevations of AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), GGT (GGTP), or LDH have occurred in approximately 1 in 3 subjects treated with acitretin. Of the 525 subjects treated in clinical trials in the U.S., treatment was discontinued in 20 (3.8%) due to elevated liver function test results. If hepatotoxicity is suspected during treatment with acitretin, the drug should be discontinued and the etiology further investigated.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Ten of 652 subjects treated in U.S. clinical trials of etretinate, of which acitretin is the active metabolite, had clinical or histologic hepatitis considered to be possibly or probably related to etretinate treatment.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">There have been reports of hepatitis-related deaths worldwide; a few of these subjects had received etretinate for a month or less before presenting with hepatic symptoms or signs.</span></p><h3>Skeletal Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">In adults receiving long-term treatment with acitretin, appropriate examinations should be periodically performed in view of possible ossification abnormalities (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). Because the frequency and severity of iatrogenic bony abnormality in adults is low, periodic radiography is only warranted in the presence of symptoms or long-term use of acitretin. If such disorders arise, the continuation of therapy should be discussed with the patient on the basis of a careful risk/benefit analysis. In clinical trials with acitretin, subjects were prospectively evaluated for evidence of development or change in bony abnormalities of the vertebral column, knees, and ankles.</p><p>Of 380 subjects treated with acitretin, 15% had preexisting abnormalities of the spine which showed new changes or progression of preexisting findings. Changes included degenerative spurs, anterior bridging of spinal vertebrae, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, ligament calcification, and narrowing and destruction of a cervical disc space. De novo changes (formation of small spurs) were seen in 3 subjects after 1½ to 2½ years.</p><p>Six of 128 subjects treated with acitretin showed abnormalities in the knees and ankles before treatment that progressed during treatment. In 5, these changes involved the formation of additional spurs or enlargement of existing spurs. The sixth subject had degenerative joint disease which worsened. No subjects developed spurs de novo. Clinical complaints did not predict radiographic changes.</p><h3>Lipids and Possible Cardiovascular Effects</h3><p class="First">Blood lipid determinations should be performed before acitretin is administered and again at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks until the lipid response to the drug is established, usually within 4 to 8 weeks. In subjects receiving acitretin during clinical trials, 66% and 33% experienced elevation in triglycerides and cholesterol, respectively. Decreased high density lipoproteins (HDL) occurred in 40% of subjects. These effects of acitretin were generally reversible upon cessation of therapy.</p><p>Subjects with an increased tendency to develop hypertriglyceridemia included those with disturbances of lipid metabolism, diabetes mellitus, obesity, increased alcohol intake, or a familial history of these conditions. Because of the risk of hypertriglyceridemia, serum lipids must be more closely monitored in high-risk patients and during long-term treatment.</p><p>Hypertriglyceridemia and lowered HDL may increase a patient’s cardiovascular risk status. Although no causal relationship has been established, there have been postmarketing reports of acute myocardial infarction or thromboembolic events in patients on therapy with acitretin. In addition, elevation of serum triglycerides to greater than 800 mg per dL has been associated with fatal fulminant pancreatitis. Therefore, dietary modifications, reduction in dose of acitretin, or drug therapy should be employed to control significant elevations of triglycerides. If, despite these measures, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL levels persist, the discontinuation of acitretin should be considered.</p><h3>Ophthalmologic Effects</h3><p class="First">The eyes and vision of 329 subjects treated with acitretin were examined by ophthalmologists. The findings included dry eyes (23%), irritation of eyes (9%), and brow and lash loss (5%). The following were reported in less than 5% of subjects: Bell’s palsy, blepharitis and/or crusting of lids, blurred vision, conjunctivitis, corneal epithelial abnormality, cortical cataract, decreased night vision, diplopia, itchy eyes or eyelids, nuclear cataract, pannus, papilledema, photophobia, posterior subcapsular cataract, recurrent sties, and subepithelial corneal lesions.</p><p>Any patient treated with acitretin who is experiencing visual difficulties should discontinue the drug and undergo ophthalmologic evaluation.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Lipid elevations occur in 25% to 50% of subjects treated with acitretin. Triglyceride increases sufficient to be associated with pancreatitis are much less common, although fatal fulminant pancreatitis has been reported. There have been rare reports of pancreatitis during therapy with acitretin in the absence of hypertriglyceridemia.</p><h3>Pseudotumor Cerebri</h3><p class="First">Acitretin and other retinoids administered orally have been associated with cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension). Some of these events involved concomitant use of isotretinoin and tetracyclines. However, the event seen in a single patient receiving acitretin was not associated with tetracycline use. Early signs and symptoms include papilledema, headache, nausea and vomiting, and visual disturbances. Patients with these signs and symptoms should be examined for papilledema and, if present, should discontinue acitretin immediately and be referred for neurological evaluation and care. Since both acitretin and tetracyclines can cause increased intracranial pressure, their combined use is contraindicated (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><h3>Capillary Leak Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Capillary leak syndrome, a potential manifestation of retinoic acid syndrome, has been reported in patients receiving acitretin. Features of this syndrome may include localized or generalized edema with secondary weight gain, fever, and hypotension. Rhabdomyolysis and myalgias have been reported in association with capillary leak syndrome, and laboratory tests may reveal neutrophilia, hypoalbuminemia, and an elevated hematocrit. Discontinue acitretin if capillary leak syndrome develops during therapy.</p><h3>Exfoliative Dermatitis/Erythroderma</h3><p class="First">Exfoliative dermatitis/erythroderma has been reported in patients receiving acitretin. Discontinue acitretin if exfoliative dermatitis/erythroderma occurs during therapy.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">A description of the <span class="Italics">T.A.P.P.</span> materials is provided below.

Because this threshold has not been established for acitretin in humans and because elimination rates vary among patients, the duration of posttherapy contraception to achieve adequate elimination cannot be calculated precisely (see boxed <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Females of reproductive potential should also be advised that they must not ingest beverages or products containing ethanol while taking acitretin and for 2 months after acitretin has been discontinued.</span> This allows for elimination of the acitretin which can be converted to etretinate in the presence of alcohol.</p><p>Female patients should be advised that any method of birth control can fail, including tubal ligation, and that microdosed progestin “minipill” preparations are <span class="Italics">not</span> recommended for use with acitretin (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions</span>). Data from one patient who received a very low-dosed progestin contraceptive (levonorgestrel 0.03 mg) had a significant increase of the progesterone level after 3 menstrual cycles during acitretin treatment.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>Female patients should be advised to contact their physician, women’s health centers, pharmacies, or hospital emergency rooms for information about how to obtain Emergency Contraception if sexual intercourse occurs without using 2 effective forms of contraception simultaneously. A 24-hour, toll-free number (1-855-850-2138) is also available for patients to receive automated birth control and emergency contraception information.</p><p>Female patients should sign a consent form prior to beginning therapy with acitretin (see boxed <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Studies on lactating rats have shown that etretinate is excreted in the milk. There is one prospective case report where acitretin is reported to be excreted in human milk. Therefore, nursing mothers should not receive acitretin prior to or during nursing because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.</p><h3>All Patients</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Depression and/or other psychiatric symptoms such as aggressive feelings or thoughts of self-harm have been reported.</span> These events, including self-injurious behavior, have been reported in patients taking other systemically administered retinoids, as well as in patients taking acitretin. Since other factors may have contributed to these events, it is not known if they are related to acitretin. Patients should be counseled to stop taking acitretin and notify their prescriber immediately if they experience psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>Patients should be advised that a transient worsening of psoriasis is sometimes seen during the initial treatment period. Patients should be advised that they may have to wait 2 to 3 months before they get the full benefit of acitretin, although some patients may achieve significant improvements within the first 8 weeks of treatment as demonstrated in clinical trials.</p><p>Decreased night vision has been reported during therapy with acitretin. Patients should be advised of this potential problem and warned to be cautious when driving or operating any vehicle at night. Visual problems should be carefully monitored (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). Patients should be advised that they may experience decreased tolerance to contact lenses during the treatment period and sometimes after treatment has stopped.</p><p>Patients should not donate blood during and for at least 3 years following therapy because acitretin can cause birth defects and women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with acitretin.</p><p>Because of the relationship of acitretin to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin A supplements in excess of minimum recommended daily allowances to avoid possible additive toxic effects.</p><p>Patients should avoid the use of sun lamps and excessive exposure to sunlight (non-medical UV exposure) because the effects of UV light are enhanced by retinoids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients should be advised that they must not give their Acitretin Capsules to any other person.</span></p><h3>For Prescribers</h3><p class="First">Acitretin has not been studied in and is not indicated for treatment of acne.</p><h3>Phototherapy</h3><p class="First">Significantly lower doses of phototherapy are required when acitretin is used because effects on the stratum corneum induced by acitretin can increase the risk of erythema (burning) (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Ethanol</span></span></p><p>Clinical evidence has shown that etretinate can be formed with concurrent ingestion of acitretin and ethanol (see boxed <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span></span>and <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Glyburide</span></span></p><p>In a trial of 7 healthy male volunteers, acitretin treatment potentiated the blood glucose-lowering effect of glyburide (a sulfonylurea similar to chlorpropamide) in 3 of the 7 subjects. Repeating the trial with 6 healthy male volunteers in the absence of glyburide did not detect an effect of acitretin on glucose tolerance. Careful supervision of diabetic patients under treatment with acitretin is recommended (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hormonal Contraceptives</span></span></p><p>It has not been established if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between acitretin and combined oral contraceptives. However, it has been established that acitretin interferes with the contraceptive effect of microdosed progestin “minipill” preparations. Microdosed “minipill” progestin preparations are not recommended for use with acitretin (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions</span>). <span class="Italics">It is not known whether other progestin-only contraceptives, such as implants and injectables, are adequate methods of contraception during acitretin therapy.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Methotrexate</span></span></p><p>An increased risk of hepatitis has been reported to result from combined use of methotrexate and etretinate.

In addition, new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during retinoid therapy, including diabetic ketoacidosis. In diabetics, blood-sugar levels should be monitored very carefully.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lipids</span></span></p><p>In clinical trials, the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia was 66%, hypercholesterolemia was 33%, and that of decreased HDL was 40%. Pretreatment and follow-up measurements should be obtained under fasting conditions. It is recommended that these tests be performed weekly or every other week until the lipid response to acitretin has stabilized (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Liver Function Tests</span></span></p><p>Elevations of AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or LDH were experienced by approximately 1 in 3 patients treated with acitretin.

There were no neoplastic lesions observed that were considered to have been related to treatment with acitretin. An 80-week carcinogenesis study in mice has been completed with etretinate, the ethyl ester of acitretin. Blood level data obtained during this study demonstrated that etretinate was metabolized to acitretin and that blood levels of acitretin exceeded those of etretinate at all times studied. In the etretinate study, an increased incidence of blood vessel tumors (hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas at several different sites) was noted in male, but not female, mice at doses approximately one-half the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on a mg-per-m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span></span></p><p>Acitretin was evaluated for mutagenic potential in the Ames test, in the Chinese hamster (V79/HGPRT) assay, in unscheduled DNA synthesis assays using rat hepatocytes and human fibroblasts, and in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay. No evidence of mutagenicity of acitretin was demonstrated in any of these assays.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility</span></span></p><p>In a fertility study in rats, the fertility of treated animals was not impaired at the highest dosage of acitretin tested, 3 mg per kg per day (approximately one-half the maximum recommended therapeutic dose based on a mg-per-m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison). Chronic toxicity studies in dogs revealed testicular changes (reversible mild to moderate spermatogenic arrest and appearance of multinucleated giant cells) in the highest dosage group (50 then 30 mg per kg per day).</p><p>No decreases in sperm count or concentration and no changes in sperm motility or morphology were noted in 31 men (17 psoriatic subjects, 8 subjects with disorders of keratinization, and 6 healthy volunteers) given 30 to 50 mg per day of acitretin for at least 12 weeks. In these trials, no deleterious effects were seen on either testosterone production, LH, or FSH in any of the 31 men.<span class="Sup">4-6</span> No deleterious effects were seen on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in any of the 18 men where it was measured.<span class="Sup">4,5</span></p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category X</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(See boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS)</span>.</p><p>In a study in which acitretin was administered to male rats only at a dosage of 5 mg per kg per day for 10 weeks (approximate duration of one spermatogenic cycle) prior to and during mating with untreated female rats, no teratogenic effects were observed in the progeny (see boxed <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span></span>for information about male use of acitretin).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects</span></span></p><p>In rats dosed at 3 mg per kg per day (approximately one-half the maximum recommended therapeutic dose based on a mg-per-m<span class="Sup">2</span> comparison), slightly decreased pup survival and delayed incisor eruption were noted. At the next lowest dose tested, 1 mg per kg per day, no treatment-related adverse effects were observed.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. No clinical trials have been conducted in pediatric subjects. Ossification of interosseous ligaments and tendons of the extremities, skeletal hyperostoses, decreases in bone mineral density, and premature epiphyseal closure have been reported in children taking other systemic retinoids, including etretinate, a metabolite of acitretin. A causal relationship between these effects and acitretin has not been established. While it is not known that these occurrences are more severe or more frequent in children, there is special concern in pediatric patients because of the implications for growth potential (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>, <span class="Bold">Hyperostosis</span></span>).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of acitretin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A 2-fold increase in acitretin plasma concentrations was seen in healthy elderly subjects compared with young subjects, although the elimination half-life did not change (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold">Special Populations</span>).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Hypervitaminosis A produces a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms primarily of the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hepatic, neuropsychiatric, and central nervous systems. Many of the clinical adverse reactions reported to date with administration of acitretin resemble those of the hypervitaminosis A syndrome.</p><h3>Adverse Events/Postmarketing Reports</h3><p class="First">In <span class="Bold">addition</span> to the events listed in the tables for the clinical trials, the following adverse events have been identified during postapproval use of acitretin. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular</span></span></p><p>Acute myocardial infarction, thromboembolism (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>), stroke.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Immune System Disorders</span></span></p><p>Hypersensitivity, including angioedema and urticaria (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nervous System</span></span></p><p>Myopathy with peripheral neuropathy has been reported during therapy with acitretin.

Elevations of AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) or LDH were experienced by approximately 1 in 3 subjects treated with acitretin. In most subjects, elevations were slight to moderate and returned to normal either during continuation of therapy or after cessation of treatment. In subjects receiving acitretin during clinical trials, 66% and 33% experienced elevation in triglycerides and cholesterol, respectively. Decreased high density lipoproteins (HDL) occurred in 40% (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Transient, usually reversible elevations of alkaline phosphatase have been observed.</p><p>Table 5 lists the laboratory abnormalities reported during clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5.

Symptoms of overdose are identical to acute hypervitaminosis A (e.g., headache and vertigo). The acute oral toxicity (LD<span class="Sub">50</span>) of acitretin in both mice and rats was greater than 4,000 mg per kg.</p><p>In one reported case of overdose, a 32-year-old male with Darier’s disease took 21 x 25-mg capsules (525-mg single dose). He vomited several hours later but experienced no other ill effects.</p><p><span class="Bold">All female patients of childbearing potential</span> who have taken an overdose of acitretin must:</p><p>1) Have a pregnancy test at the time of overdose; 2) Be counseled as per the boxed <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND <span class="Bold">WARNINGS </span></span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> sections regarding birth defects and contraceptive use for at least 3 years’ duration after the overdose.</p><h2>Acitretin Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">There is intersubject variation in the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and incidence of side effects with Acitretin Capsules. A number of the more common side effects are dose-related. Individualization of dosage is required to achieve sufficient therapeutic response while minimizing side effects. Therapy with Acitretin Capsules should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg per day, given as a single dose with the main meal. Maintenance doses of 25 to 50 mg per day may be given dependent upon an individual patient’s response to initial treatment. Relapses may be treated as outlined for initial therapy.</p><p>When Acitretin Capsules are used with phototherapy, the prescriber should decrease the phototherapy dose, dependent on the patient’s individual response (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Females who have taken TEGISON (etretinate) must continue to follow the contraceptive recommendations for TEGISON. TEGISON is no longer marketed in the U.S.; for information, call 1-888-838-2872.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Information for Pharmacists</span></p><p>Acitretin Capsules must only be dispensed in no more than a monthly supply.

<li><span class="Bold">Severe birth defects.</span> If you are a female who can get pregnant, you should use Acitretin Capsules only if you are not pregnant now, can avoid becoming pregnant for at least 3 years, and other medicines do not work for your severe psoriasis or you cannot use other psoriasis medicines. Information about effects on unborn babies and about how to avoid pregnancy is found in the next section: “<span class="Bold">What are the important warnings and instructions for females taking Acitretin Capsules?</span>”</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Liver problems,</span> including abnormal liver function tests and inflammation of your liver (hepatitis). Your prescriber should do blood tests to check how your liver is working before you start taking and during treatment with Acitretin Capsules. Stop taking Acitretin Capsules and call your prescriber right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms of a serious liver problem:
<ul class="Circle">
<li>yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes</li>
<li>nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>loss of appetite</li>
<li>dark urine</li>

</ul><ul class="Circle">

<li>dark urine</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">What are the important warnings and instructions for females taking Acitretin Capsules?</span></p><ul class="Disk">
<li><span class="Bold">Before you receive your first prescription for Acitretin Capsules, you should have discussed and signed a Patient Agreement/Informed Consent for Female Patients form with your prescriber. This is to help make sure you understand the risk of birth defects and how to avoid getting pregnant. If you did not talk to your prescriber about this and sign the form, contact your prescriber.</span></li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Important: If you are a female who can become pregnant:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">You must not take Acitretin Capsules if you are pregnant or might become pregnant during treatment or at any time for at least 3 years after you stop treatment because Acitretin Capsules can cause severe birth defects.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">During treatment with Acitretin Capsules and for 2 months after you stop treatment with Acitretin Capsules, you must avoid drinks, foods, and all medicines that contain alcohol. This includes over-the-counter products that contain alcohol.</span> Avoiding alcohol is very important, because alcohol changes Acitretin Capsules into a drug that may take longer than 3 years to leave your body. The chance of birth defects may last longer than 3 years if you swallow any form of alcohol during treatment with Acitretin Capsules and for 2 months after you stop taking Acitretin Capsules.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">You and your prescriber must be sure you are not pregnant before you start therapy with Acitretin Capsules. You must have negative results from 2 pregnancy tests before you start treatment with Acitretin Capsules.</span> A negative result shows you are not pregnant. Because it takes a few days after pregnancy begins for a test to show that you are pregnant, the first negative test may not ensure you are not pregnant. Do not start Acitretin Capsules until you have negative results from 2 pregnancy tests.
<ul class="Circle">
<li>The <span class="Bold">first pregnancy test</span> (urine or blood) will be done at the time you and your prescriber decide if Acitretin Capsules might be right for you.</li>
<li>The <span class="Bold">second pregnancy test</span> will usually be done during the first 5 days of your menstrual period. You must start taking Acitretin Capsules within 7 days of when the urine or blood for the second pregnancy test is collected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After you start taking Acitretin Capsules, you must have a pregnancy test repeated each month that you are taking Acitretin Capsules. This is to be sure that you are not pregnant during treatment because Acitretin Capsules can cause birth defects. In addition, your prescription of Acitretin Capsules will be limited to a monthly supply.</li>
<li>For at least 3 years after stopping treatment with Acitretin Capsules, you must have a pregnancy test repeated every 3 months to make sure that you are not pregnant.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Discuss effective birth control (contraception) with your prescriber. You must use 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time during all of the following:</span>
<ul class="Circle">
<li>for at least 1 month before beginning treatment with Acitretin Capsules</li>
<li>during treatment with Acitretin Capsules</li>
<li>for at least 3 years after stopping treatment with Acitretin Capsules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="Bold">If you are sexually active, you must use 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time even if you think you cannot become pregnant, unless 1 of the following is true for you:</span>
<ul class="Circle">
<li>You had your womb (uterus) removed during an operation (a hysterectomy).</li>
<li>Your prescriber said you have gone completely through menopause (the “change of life”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="Bold">You can get a free birth control counseling session and pregnancy testing from a prescriber or family planning expert. Your prescriber can give you a Contraception Counseling Referral Form for this free session.</span></li>
</ul><ul class="Circle">
<li>The <span class="Bold">first pregnancy test</span> (urine or blood) will be done at the time you and your prescriber decide if Acitretin Capsules might be right for you.</li>
<li>The <span class="Bold">second pregnancy test</span> will usually be done during the first 5 days of your menstrual period. You must start taking Acitretin Capsules within 7 days of when the urine or blood for the second pregnancy test is collected.</li>
</ul><ul class="Circle">
<li>for at least 1 month before beginning treatment with Acitretin Capsules</li>

</ul><ul class="Circle">
<li>You had your womb (uterus) removed during an operation (a hysterectomy).</li>
<li>Your prescriber said you have gone completely through menopause (the “change of life”).</li>
</ul><p>The following are considered effective forms of birth control:</p><p><span class="Bold">Primary Forms:</span></p><ul class="Circle">
<li>having your tubes tied (tubal ligation)</li>
<li>partner’s vasectomy</li>
<li>IUD (Intrauterine device)</li>
<li>birth control pills that contain both estrogen and progestin (combination oral contraceptives); not progestin-only “minipills”</li>
<li>hormonal birth control products that are injected, implanted, or inserted in your body</li>
<li>birth control patch</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Secondary Forms (use with a Primary Form):</span></p><ul class="Circle">
<li>diaphragms with spermicide</li>
<li>condoms (with or without spermicide)</li>
<li>cervical caps with spermicide</li>
<li>vaginal sponge (contains spermicide)</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">At least 1 of your 2 methods of birth control must be a primary form.</span></p><ul class="Disk">
<li><span class="Bold">If you have sex at any time without using 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time, or if you get pregnant or miss your period, stop using Acitretin Capsules and call your prescriber right away.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Consider “Emergency Contraception” (EC) if you have sex with a male without correctly using 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time.</span> EC is also called “emergency birth control” which includes the “morning after” pill. Contact your prescriber <span class="Bold">as soon as possible</span> if you have sex without using 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) at the same time, because EC works best if it is used within 1 or 2 days after sex. EC is not a replacement for your usual 2 effective forms of birth control (contraception) because it is not as effective as regular birth control methods.<br/>
Contact your prescriber, women’s health centers, pharmacies, or hospital emergency rooms for information on how to get emergency contraception. A 24-hour, toll-free number (1-855-850-2138) is also available for patients to receive automated birth control and emergency contraception information.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Stop taking Acitretin Capsules right away and contact your prescriber if you get pregnant while taking Acitretin Capsules or at any time for at least 3 years after treatment has stopped. You need to discuss the possible effects on the unborn baby with your prescriber.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">If you do become pregnant while taking Acitretin Capsules or at any time for at least 3 years after stopping Acitretin Capsules, you should report your pregnancy to Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-888-838-2872 or directly to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) MedWatch program at 1-800-FDA-1088.</span> Your name will be kept in private (confidential). The information you share will help the FDA and the manufacturer evaluate the Pregnancy Prevention Program for Acitretin Capsules.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Do not take Acitretin Capsules if you are breastfeeding.</span> Acitretin can pass into your milk and may harm your baby. You will need to choose either to breastfeed or take Acitretin Capsules, but not both.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">What should males know before taking Acitretin Capsules?</span></p><p>Small amounts of acitretin are found in the semen of males taking Acitretin Capsules. Based upon available information, it appears that these small amounts of acitretin in semen pose little, if any, risk to an unborn child while a male patient is taking the drug or after it is discontinued.

Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes cells in the outer layer of the skin to grow faster than normal and pile up on the skin’s surface. In the most common type of psoriasis, the skin becomes inflamed and produces red, thickened areas, often with silvery scales.</p><p><span class="Bold">Because Acitretin Capsules can have serious side effects,</span> you should talk with your prescriber about whether possible benefits of Acitretin Capsules outweigh their possible risks.</p><p>Acitretin Capsules may not work right away. You may have to wait 2 to 3 months before you get the full benefit of Acitretin Capsules. Psoriasis gets worse for some patients when they first start treatment with Acitretin Capsules.</p><p>Acitretin Capsules have not been studied in children.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Who should not take Acitretin Capsules?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
