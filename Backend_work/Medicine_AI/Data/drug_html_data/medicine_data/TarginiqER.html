Naloxone blocks certain effects of opioid medication, including feelings of well-being that can lead to opioid abuse. Oxycodone is an opioid pain medication. An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic.</p><p>Targiniq ER is used for around-the-clock treatment of severe pain, that is not controlled by other medicines. Naloxone is included in this medicine to prevent the misuse of the narcotic ingredient.</p><p>Targiniq ER is not for use on an as-needed basis for pain that is not around-the-clock.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Targiniq ER if you have severe asthma or breathing problems, severe liver disease, or a blockage in your stomach or intestines.</p><p>Oxycodone can slow or stop your breathing. Never use this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Swallow the tablet whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose. Targiniq ER may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it.</p><p><b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. <b>Oxycodone may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in a newborn if the mother has taken this medicine during pregnancy.</b></p><p><b>Some medicines can interact with naloxone and oxycodone, and cause dangerous side effects or death.</b> Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using.</p><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Targiniq ER if you are allergic to naloxone or oxycodone, or if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>severe asthma or breathing problems;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>a blockage in your stomach or intestines.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>severe asthma or breathing problems;</p><p>severe liver disease; or</p><p>a blockage in your stomach or intestines.</p><p>Some medicines can interact with oxycodone and cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Be sure your doctor knows if you also take medicine for depression, mental illness, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting. Ask your doctor before making any changes in how or when you take your medications.</p><p>To make sure Targiniq ER is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>

<p>any type of breathing problem or lung disease;</p>

</ul><p>any type of breathing problem or lung disease;</p><p>a history of head injury, brain tumor, or seizures;</p><p>a history of drug abuse, alcohol addiction, or mental illness;</p><p>urination problems;</p><p>liver or kidney disease;</p><p>heart disease;</p><p>problems with your gallbladder, pancreas, or thyroid; or</p><p>if you use a sedative like Valium (diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, Ativan, Klonopin, Restoril, Tranxene, Versed, Xanax, and others).</p><p>It is not known whether Targiniq ER will harm an unborn baby. If you use this medicine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on oxycodone. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>Oxycodone can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while you are using Targiniq ER.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Targiniq ER?</h2><p>Take Targiniq ER exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Oxycodone can slow or stop your breathing, especially when you start using this medicine or whenever your dose is changed. Never take Targiniq ER in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Oxycodone may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away Targiniq ER is against the law.</p><p>Do not crush, chew, or break a Targiniq ER extended release tablet. Swallow it whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose.</p><p>Targiniq ER is usually taken every 12 hours. Take the medicine at the same time each day.</p><p>Do not stop using Targiniq ER suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using Targiniq ER.</p><p>Never crush or break a Targiniq ER pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. This practice has resulted in death with the misuse of oxycodone and similar prescription drugs.</p><p>Store at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and light.</p><p>Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Oxycodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover Targiniq ER tablets. Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush any unused tablets down the toilet. Disposal of medicines by flushing is recommended to reduce the danger of accidental overdose causing death. This advice applies to a very small number of medicines only. The FDA, working with the manufacturer, has determined this method to be the most appropriate route of disposal and presents the least risk to human safety.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Targiniq ER is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A Targiniq ER overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, weak or limp muscles, cold and clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, loss of consciousness, weak pulse, or slowed breathing (breathing may stop).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death can occur when alcohol is combined with Targiniq ER.</p><p>This medication may impair your thinking or reactions.
