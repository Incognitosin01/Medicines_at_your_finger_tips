</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Cefazolin and Dextrose</h2><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP and other antibacterial drugs, Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible bacteria.</p><h3>Respiratory Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">Respiratory tract infections due to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus</span> and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span>.</p><p>Injectable benzathine penicillin is considered the drug of choice in treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever.</p><p>Cefazolin is effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of cefazolin in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available.</p><h3>Urinary Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">Urinary tract infections due to <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli,</span> and <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span>.</p><h3>Skin and Skin Structure Infections</h3><p class="First">Skin and skin structure infections due to <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>, <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes</span>, and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus agalactiae</span>.</p><h3>Biliary Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">Biliary infections due to <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>, various isolates of streptococci, <span class="Italics">P. mirabilis,</span> and <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>.</p><h3>Bone and Joint Infections</h3><p class="First">Bone and joint infections due to <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span>.</p><h3>Genital Infections</h3><p class="First">Genital infections due to <span class="Italics">E. coli,</span> and <span class="Italics">P. mirabilis.</span></p><h3>Septicemia</h3><p class="First">Septicemia due to <span class="Italics">S. pneumoniae, S. aureus</span>, <span class="Italics">P. mirabilis,</span> and <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>.</p><h3>Endocarditis</h3><p class="First">Endocarditis due to <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> and <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes.</span></p><h3>Perioperative Prophylaxis</h3><p class="First">The prophylactic administration of cefazolin preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures which are classified as contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., vaginal hysterectomy, and cholecystectomy in high-risk patients such as those older than 70 years, with acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, or common duct bile stones).</p><p>The perioperative use of cefazolin may also be effective in surgical patients in whom infection at the operative site would present a serious risk (e.g., during open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty).</p><p>If there are signs of infection, specimens for cultures should be obtained for the identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapy may be instituted.</p><h2>Cefazolin and Dextrose Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage for Treatment of Indicated Infections in Adults</h3><p class="First">Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in the DUPLEX® Container should be used only in patients who require the entire 1 or 2 gram dose and not any fraction thereof. The recommended adult dosages are outlined in Table 1. Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP should be administered intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes.</p><h3>Dosage for Perioperative Prophylactic Use in Adults</h3><p class="First">To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, recommended doses are:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>1 to 2 gram IV administered 1/2 hour to 1 hour prior to the start of surgery.</li>
<li>For lengthy operative procedures (e.g., 2 hours or more), 500 mg to 1 gram IV during surgery (administration modified depending on the duration of the operative procedure).</li>
<li>500 mg to 1 gram IV every 6 to 8 hours for 24 hours postoperatively.</li>
</ul><p>It is important that (i) the preoperative dose be given just prior (1/2 hour to 1 hour) to the start of surgery so that adequate antibacterial concentrations are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial surgical incision; and (ii) cefazolin be administered, if necessary, at appropriate intervals during surgery to provide sufficient concentrations of the antibacterial drug at the anticipated moments of greatest exposure to infective organisms. </p><p>The prophylactic administration of cefazolin should usually be discontinued within a 24-hour period after the surgical procedure. In surgery where the occurrence of infection may be particularly devastating (e.g., open-heart surgery and prosthetic arthroplasty), the prophylactic administration of cefazolin may be continued for 3 to 5 days following the completion of surgery.</p><h3>Dosage in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The 2 grams dose of Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.</p><p>Only administer 1 gram Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP to pediatric patients where the individual dose is the entire contents of the 1g DUPLEX® container and not any fraction of it.</p><p>Recommended doses for pediatric patients are as follows:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>For most mild to moderately severe infections: a total daily dosage of 25 to 50 mg per kg of body weight, divided into 3 or 4 equal doses. </li>
<li>For severe infections, the total daily dosage may be increased to 100 mg per kg of body weight.</li>
</ul><p>There are no dosage recommendations for pediatric patients for perioperative prophylaxis or for pediatric patients with renal impairment.</p><h3>Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Cefazolin may be used in patients with renal impairment with the dosage adjustments outlined in Table 2. All reduced dosage recommendations apply after an initial loading dose appropriate to the severity of the infection.</p><h3>Preparation for Use of Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in DUPLEX® Container</h3><p class="First">This reconstituted solution is for intravenous use only.</p><p>Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use would result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">DUPLEX® Container Storage</span></span></p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Dual-chamber, single-use container:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>1 g Cefazolin for Injection USP and 50 mL 4% Dextrose Injection USP</li>
<li>2 g Cefazolin for Injection USP and 50 mL 3% Dextrose Injection USP</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity to Cefazolin or the Cephalosporin Class of Antibacterial Drugs, Penicillins, or Other Beta-lactams</h3><p class="First">Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is contraindicated in patients who have a history of immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions) to cefazolin or the cephalosporin class of antibacterial drugs, penicillins, or other beta-lactams [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions to Cefazolin, Cephalosporins, Penicillins, or Other Beta-lactams</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefazolin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP occurs, discontinue the drug.</p><h3>Use In Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">As with other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs, seizures may occur if inappropriately high doses are administered to patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 55 mL/min.) [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefazolin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing isolates of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity to Dextrose-containing Products</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of dextrose-containing products. These reactions have been reported in patients receiving high concentrations of dextrose (i.e. 50% dextrose)<span class="Sup">1</span>.  The reactions have also been reported when corn-derived dextrose solutions were administered to patients with or without a history of hypersensitivity to corn products.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><h3>Risk of Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><p>As with other antimicrobials, prolonged use of Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential. Should superinfection occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">The administration of cefazolin may result in a false-positive reaction with glucose in the urine when using CLINITEST® tablets. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (e.g., CLINISTIX®) be used. </p><p class="First">Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with cefazolin. In hematologic studies or in transfusion cross-matching procedures when antiglobulin tests are performed on the minor side or in Coombs' testing of newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin antibacterial drugs before parturition, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs' test may be due to the drug.</p><h3>Patients with Overt or Known Subclinical Diabetes Mellitus or Carbohydrate Intolerance</h3><p class="First">As with other dextrose-containing solutions, Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP should be prescribed with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions to cefazolin are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Hypersensitivity reactions [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>] </li>
<li><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>]</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions were reported from clinical trials:</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, oral candidiasis (oral thrush), mouth ulcers, vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps, epigastric pain, heartburn, flatus, anorexia and pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>].</p><p>Allergic: Anaphylaxis, eosinophilia, urticaria, itching, drug fever, skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p><p>Hematologic: Neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocythemia.</p><p>Hepatic: Transient rise in SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase levels has been observed. As with other cephalosporins, reports of hepatitis have been received.</p><p>Renal: As with other cephalosporins, reports of increased BUN and creatinine levels, as well as renal failure, have been received.</p><p>Local Reactions: Instances of phlebitis have been reported at site of injection. Some induration has occurred.</p><p>Other Reactions: Pruritus (including genital, vulvar and anal pruritus, genital moniliasis, and vaginitis). Dizziness, fainting, lightheadedness, confusion, weakness, tiredness, hypotension, somnolence and headache.</p><h3>Cephalosporin-class Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cefazolin, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibacterials: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, renal impairment, toxic nephropathy, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, hepatic impairment including cholestasis, and pancytopenia.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Probenecid may decrease renal tubular secretion of cephalosporins when used concurrently, resulting in increased and more prolonged cephalosporin blood levels.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Reproduction studies have been performed in rats, mice and rabbits at doses of 2000, 4000 and 240 mg/kg/day or 1-3 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis.  There was no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to cefazolin.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">When cefazolin has been administered prior to caesarean section, drug concentrations in cord blood have been approximately one quarter to one third of maternal drug levels. The drug appears to have no adverse effect on the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Cefazolin is present in very low concentrations in the milk of nursing mothers. Caution should be exercised when Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The 2 g Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.</p><p>To avoid unintentional overdose, 1 gram Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP should only be used in pediatric patients who require the entire contents of the 1 gram dose and not any fraction of it [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</p><p>There are no dosing recommendations for pediatric patients for perioperative prophylaxis or for pediatric patients with renal impairment.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 920 subjects who received cefazolin in clinical studies, 313 (34%) were 65 years and over, while 138 (15%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span> and<span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">When Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is administered to patients with low urinary output because of impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 55 mL/min.), lower daily dosage is required [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span><span class="Italics"> </span> and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]. </p><h2>Cefazolin and Dextrose Description</h2><p class="First">Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, single use, packaged combination of Cefazolin Sodium USP (lyophilized) and sterile iso-osmotic diluent in the DUPLEX® sterile container. The DUPLEX® Container is a flexible dual chamber container.</p><p>After reconstitution the approximate osmolality for Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is 290 mOsmol/kg.</p><p>The drug chamber is filled with sterile lyophilized Cefazolin Sodium USP, a semi-synthetic cephalosporin and has the following IUPAC nomenclature: Sodium (6<span class="Italics">R</span>,7<span class="Italics">R</span>)-3-[[(5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)thio]methyl]-8-oxo-7-[2-(1<span class="Italics">H</span>-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate.</p><p>Cefazolin Sodium USP has the following structural formula:</p><p>The sodium content is 48 mg/g of cefazolin sodium.</p><p>The diluent chamber contains Dextrose Injection USP, an iso-osmotic diluent using Hydrous Dextrose USP in Water for Injection USP. Dextrose Injection USP is sterile, nonpyrogenic, and contains no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agents.</p><p>Hydrous Dextrose USP has the following structural (molecular) formula:</p><p>The molecular weight of Hydrous Dextrose USP is 198.17</p><p>Cefazolin Sodium USP is supplied as a lyophilized form equivalent to either 1 g or 2 g of cefazolin. Dextrose hydrous USP has been added to the diluent to adjust osmolality (approximately 2 g [4.0% w/v] and 1.5 g [3.0% w/v] for the 1 g and 2 g dosages, respectively).</p><p>After removing the peelable foil strip, activating the seals, and thoroughly mixing, the reconstituted drug product is intended for single intravenous use.</p><p>Reconstituted solutions of Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP range in color from pale yellow to amber.</p><p>Not made with natural rubber latex, PVC or DEHP.</p><p>The DUPLEX® dual chamber container is made from a specially formulated material. The product (diluent and drug) contact layer is a mixture of thermoplastic rubber and a polypropylene ethylene copolymer that contains no plasticizers. The safety of the container system is supported by USP biological evaluation procedures.</p><h2>Cefazolin and Dextrose - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Cefazolin is an antibacterial drug [see <span class="Italics">Microbiology (12.4)</span>].</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for cefazolin has not been evaluated in patients.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Studies have shown that following intravenous administration of cefazolin to normal volunteers, mean serum concentrations peaked at approximately 185 mcg/mL and were approximately 4 mcg/mL at 8 hours for a 1 g dose.</p><p>The serum half-life for cefazolin is approximately 1.8 hours following IV administration.</p><p>In a study, using normal volunteers, of constant intravenous infusion with dosages of 3.5 mg/kg for 1 hour (approximately 250 mg) and 1.5 mg/kg the next 2 hours (approximately 100 mg), cefazolin produced a steady serum concentration at the third hour of approximately 28 mcg/mL.</p><p>Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of cefazolin in normal volunteers (N=12) following a single 15-minute IV infusion of 2 g of Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP are summarized in Table 3.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C<span class="Sub">max</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T<span class="Sub">max</span></span>* <br/>

This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg cefazolin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to cefazolin. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 4.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pathogen</span></p><p>Abbreviations: S= susceptible, I= intermediate, R= resistant</p><p>NOTE: <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes</span> and <span class="Italics">S. agalactiae</span> that have a penicillin MIC of ≤ 0.12 mcg/mL, or disk diffusion zone diameters of  ≥ 24 mm with a 10 mcg penicillin disk, may be interpreted as susceptible to cefazolin.</p><p>NOTE: Susceptibility of staphylococci to cefazolin may be deduced from testing either cefoxitin or oxacillin.</p><p>A report of <span class="Italics">Susceptible</span> indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen. A report of <span class="Italics">Intermediate</span> indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug product is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug product can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of <span class="Italics">Resistant</span> indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.</p><p class="First">Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individual performing the test <span class="Sup">3, 4, 5</span>. Standard cefazolin powder should provide the following MIC values noted in Table 5. For the diffusion technique using the 30 mcg disk, the criteria in Table 5 should be achieved.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Mutagenicity studies and long-term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP have not been performed.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP in the DUPLEX® Container is a flexible dual chamber container supplied in two concentrations. After reconstitution, the concentrations are equivalent to 1 g and 2 g cefazolin. The diluent chamber contains approximately 50 mL of Dextrose Injection USP. Dextrose Injection USP has been adjusted to 4.0% and 3.0% for the 1 g and 2 g doses, respectively, such that the reconstituted solution is iso-osmotic.</p><p>Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is supplied sterile and nonpyrogenic in the DUPLEX® Container packaged 24 units per case.</p><p>Store the unactivated unit at 20-25°C (68-77°F). Excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F). Do not freeze.</p><p>As with other cephalosporins, reconstituted Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP tends to darken depending on storage conditions, within the stated recommendations. However, product potency is not adversely affected.</p><p>Use only if prepared solution is clear and free from particulate matter.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Patients should be advised that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions could occur and that serious reactions require immediate treatment and discontinuation of cefazolin. Patients should report to their health care provider any previous allergic reactions to cefazolin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other similar antibacterials.</p><p>Patients should be advised that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterials. If this occurs, patients should contact a physician as soon as possible.</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefazolin for Injection USP and Dextrose Injection USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p class="First">Rx only</p><p>DUPLEX is a registered trademark of B.
