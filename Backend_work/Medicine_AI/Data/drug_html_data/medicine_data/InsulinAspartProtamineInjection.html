</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Insulin Aspart Protamine Injection</h2><p class="First">Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 is a mixture of insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart indicated to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><h2>Insulin Aspart Protamine Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Information</h3><h3>Dosage Information</h3><h3>Dosage Adjustment Due to Drug Interactions</h3><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injectable suspension: 100 units per mL (U-100) of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30, 70% insulin aspart protamine and 30% insulin aspart, is a white and cloudy suspension available as:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 is contraindicated</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Never Share Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen Between Patients</h3><p class="First">Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.</p><h3>Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span></span><span class="Italics">5.3)<span class="following_xmChange">]</span></span> <span class="following_xmChange">or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span></span><span class="Italics">6.1<span class="following_xmChange">,</span> 6.3<span class="following_xmChange">)].</span></span> <span class="following_xmChange">Make any changes to a patient’s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed.</span></p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of all insulin therapies, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).</p><p>Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>, or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Accidental mix-ups between Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 and other insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)].</span> Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">All insulin products, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration).</p><h3>Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists</h3><p class="First">Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere:</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, therefore, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 55 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 43.2 years. Sixty-four percent were male and 100% were Caucasian. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years.</p><p>The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 85 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 62.7 years. Fifty-four percent were male and 100% were Caucasian. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.1 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The mean duration of diabetes was 15.0 years.</p><p>Common adverse reactions were defined as events occurring in ≥5%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events occurring at the same rate or greater for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30-treated subjects than on comparator-treated subjects during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The trial was a three-month, open-label trial in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were treated twice daily (before breakfast and before supper) with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 than on comparator</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mix 70/30</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=55)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Novolin 70/30</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=49)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preferred Term</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">%</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">%</span></p><p class="First">Hypoglycemia</p><p class="First">38</p><p class="First">69</p><p class="First">37</p><p class="First">76</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">19</p><p class="First">35</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">Influenza-like symptoms</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">13</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Dyspepsia</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">Back pain</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">Pharyngitis</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Rhinitis</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">Skeletal pain</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">Upper respiratory tract infection</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">2</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Adverse reactions Occurring in ≥ 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 and at the same rate or greater on Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 than on comparator</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=85)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Novolin 70/30</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=102)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Preferred Term</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">%</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">%</span></p><p class="First">Hypoglycemia</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">47</p><p class="First">51</p><p class="First">50</p><p class="First">Upper respiratory tract infection</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Neuropathy</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Pharyngitis</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">Abdominal pain</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Rhinitis</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">2</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Severe Hypoglycemia</span></span></p><p>Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span> The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.</p><p>Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30.</p><p>The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients receiving subcutaneous Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 was 16% and 4% for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients respectively at 12 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Allergic Reactions</span></span></p><p>Patients have experienced reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 injection.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p><p>In a 3-month study with an extension in adult subjects with type 2 diabetes, 100% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study including 91.4% that were positive at baseline. A total of 91.4% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study, including 62.1% that were positive at baseline.</p><p>In a phase 3 type 2 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin followed by a decrease approaching to baseline values was observed in Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 and Novolin 70/30 treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart.

However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30, or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In elderly patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal failure. Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 has not been studied. Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6)].</span> Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise, may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately.</p><h2>Insulin Aspart Protamine Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Insulin aspart protamine and insulin aspart is a human insulin analog containing 70% insulin aspart protamine crystals and 30% soluble insulin aspart. Insulin aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing <span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> (baker’s yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">256</span>H<span class="Sub">381</span>N<span class="Sub">65</span>O<span class="Sub">79</span>S<span class="Sub">6</span> and a molecular weight of 5825.8 Da.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1. Structural formula of insulin aspart</span></p><p>Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 is a uniform, white, and cloudy, sterile suspension for subcutaneous use. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (1.25 mg), glycerol (16.0 mg), metacresol (1.72 mg), phenol (1.50 mg), protamine sulfate (0.32 mg), sodium chloride (0.877 mg), zinc (19.6 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 has a pH of 7.20 - 7.44. Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH.</p><h2>Insulin Aspart Protamine Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The primary activity of insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analog lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A euglycemic clamp study described below assessed glucose utilization after subcutaneous dosing of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 in healthy subjects (n = 24). Following a 0.3 units/kg single subcutaneous dose, the onset of action is between 10-20 minutes for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 compared to 30 minutes for Novolin 70/30. The mean ± SD time to peak activity for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 is 2.7 hr ± 0.9 hr compared to 4.3 hr ± 3.9 hr for Novolin 70/30. The duration of action may be as long as 24 hours (see Figure 2).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2. Pharmacodynamic Activity Profile of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 and Novolin 70/30 in healthy subjects after single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The single substitution of the amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 in insulin aspart reduces the molecule’s tendency to form hexamers as observed with regular human insulin. The rapid absorption characteristics of insulin aspart are maintained by Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption and Bioavailability</span></p><p>The 30% insulin aspart in the soluble component of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 is absorbed more rapidly from the subcutaneous layer than regular human insulin. The remaining 70% is in crystalline form as insulin aspart protamine which has a prolonged absorption profile after subcutaneous injection.</p><p>The relative bioavailability of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 compared to insulin aspart and Novolin 70/30 indicates that the insulins are absorbed to similar extent. In a euglycemic clamp study in healthy subjects (n=24) after dosing with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 (0.3 units/kg), a mean maximum serum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of 61.3 ± 20.1 milliunits/L was reached after 85 minutes. Serum insulin levels returned to baseline 16 to 20 hours after a subcutaneous dose of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 (see Fig. 3 for pharmacokinetic profiles).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 3. Pharmacokinetic Profiles of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 and Novolin 70/30 after single 0.3 units/kg subcutaneous dose</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution and Elimination</span></p><p>Insulin aspart has a low binding affinity to plasma proteins (&lt;10%), similar to that seen with regular human insulin.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Standard 2-year carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30. In 52-week studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed subcutaneously with insulin aspart, the rapid-acting component of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30, at 10, 50, and 200 units/kg/day (approximately 2, 8, and 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 unit/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively). At a dose of 200 units/kg/day, insulin aspart increased the incidence of mammary gland tumors in females when compared to untreated controls. The relevance of these findings to humans is not known.</p><p>Insulin aspart was not genotoxic in the following tests: Ames test, mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation test, human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test in mice, and in <span class="Italics">ex viv</span>o UDS test in rat liver hepatocytes.</p><p>In fertility studies in male and female rats, insulin aspart at subcutaneous doses up to 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose, based on units/body surface area) had no direct adverse effects on male and female fertility, or on general reproductive performance of animals.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">In standard biological assays in mice and rabbits, one unit of insulin aspart has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Clinical Studies in Adult Patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes</h3><p class="First">In a three-month, open-label trial, patients with type 1 (n=104) or type 2 (n=187) diabetes were treated twice daily (before breakfast and before supper) with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 or Novolin 70/30. Patients had received insulin for at least 24 months before the study. Oral hypoglycemic agents were not allowed within 1 month prior to the study or during the study. The small changes in HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> were comparable across the treatment groups (see Table 4).</p><p>The mean age of the trial population for type 1 was 43.2 years and 62.7 for type 2.

Let the insulin reach room temperature before you use it. This makes it easier to mix.</p><p>Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A).</p><p>B. Roll the pen between your palms 10 times - it is important that the pen is kept horizontal (see diagram B).</p><p>C. Then gently move the pen up and down ten times between position <span class="Bold">1</span> and <span class="Bold">2</span> as shown, so the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other (see diagram C).</p><p> Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid appears white and cloudy. Do not use the pen if the liquid appears discolored or contains particles.</p><p><span class="Bold">For every following injection</span> move the pen up and down between positions 1 and 2 at least ten times until the liquid appears white and cloudy.</p><p>After mixing, complete all the following steps of the injection right away. If there is a delay, the insulin will need to be mixed again.</p><p>Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab.</p><p>Before you inject, there must be at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to make sure the remaining insulin is evenly mixed. If there are less than 12 units left, use a new Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen.</p><p><span class="Bold">Attaching the needle</span></p><p>D. Remove the protective tab from a disposable needle.</p><p>Screw the needle tightly onto your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen. It is important that the needle is put on straight (see diagram D).</p><p>Never place a disposable needle on your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen until you are ready to take your injection. </p><p> </p><p>E. Pull off the big outer needle cap (see diagram E).</p><p>F. Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of it) (see diagram F).</p><p> Be careful not to bend or damage the needle before use.</p><p> To reduce the risk of a needle stick, <span class="Bold">never put the inner needle cap back on the needle.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Giving the airshot before each injection</span></p><p>Before each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. <span class="Bold">To avoid injecting air and to make sure you take the right dose of insulin</span>:</p><p>G. Turn the dose selector to select 2 units (see diagram G).</p><p>H. Hold your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen with the needle pointing up. Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge (see diagram H).</p><p>I. Keep the needle pointing upwards, press the push-button all the way in (see diagram I). The dose selector returns to 0.</p><p>A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 6 times.</p><p>If you do not see a drop of insulin after 6 times, do not use the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen and contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500.</p><p>A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected.</p><p><span class="Bold">Selecting your dose</span></p><p>Check and make sure that the dose selector is set at 0.</p><p>J. Turn the dose selector to the number of units you need to inject. The pointer should line up with your dose.</p><p>The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the correct dose lines up with the pointer (see diagram J). When turning the dose selector, be careful not to press the push-button as insulin will come out.</p><p>You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge.</p><p>You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose.</p><p>Do not use the cartridge scale printed on the cartridge to measure your dose of insulin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Giving the injection</span></p><p>K. Insert the needle into your skin.</p><p>Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram K). Be careful only to push the button when injecting.</p><p>Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin.</p><p>L. Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram L). This will make sure that the full dose has been given.</p><p>You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. <span class="Bold">Do not rub the area.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">After the injection</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Do not recap the needle.</span> Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury. Remove the needle from the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it. This helps to prevent infection, leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin.</p><p>M. Put the pen cap on the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen and store the Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen without the needle attached (see diagram M). Storing without the needle attached helps prevent leaking, blocking of the needle, and air from entering the Pen.</p><p><span class="Bold">How should I store Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen?</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Maintenance</span></p><p>For the safe and proper use of your Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Injectable Suspension Mix 70/30 FlexPen be sure to handle it with care.
