Estradiol is the principle intracellular human estrogen and is more potent than estrone and estriol at the receptor level; it is the primary estrogen secreted prior to menopause. Following menopause, estrone and estrone sulfate are more highly produced. Estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone through a negative feedback system; estrogen replacement reduces elevated levels of these hormones in postmenopausal women.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, mucous membranes, and the skin. Average serum estradiol concentrations (C<sub>avg</sub>) vary by product</p><p>Injection: Estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate are absorbed over several weeks following IM injection</p><p>Topical:</p><p>Alora: C<sub>avg</sub>: 41 to 98 pg/mL</p><p>Climara: C<sub>avg</sub>: 22 to 106 pg/mL</p><p>Divigel: C<sub>avg</sub>: 9.8 to 30.5 pg/mL</p><p>Elestrin: C<sub>avg</sub>: 15.4 to 39.2 pg/mL; Exposure increased by 55% with application of sunscreen 10 minutes prior to dose</p><p>Estrogel: C<sub>avg</sub> on day 14 of therapy: 28.3 pg/mL. C<sub>max</sub> of estradiol is altered by repeated daily application (for 7 days) of sunscreen (decreased by 16%) or lotion (increased by 73%) when applied 1 hour after the dose.</p><p>Evamist: C<sub>avg</sub>: 19.6 to 30.9 pg/mL</p><p>Menostar: C<sub>avg</sub>: 13.7 pg/mL</p><p>Vivelle-Dot: C<sub>avg</sub>: 34 to 104 pg/mL</p><p>Vaginal (Femring): Rapid during the first hour following application, then declines to a steady rate over 3 months; C<sub>avg</sub>: 40.6 to 76 pg/mL</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Widely distributed; high concentrations in the sex hormone target organs</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hepatic; partial metabolism via CYP3A4 enzymes; estradiol is reversibly converted to estrone and estriol; oral estradiol also undergoes enterohepatic recirculation by conjugation in the liver, followed by excretion of sulfate and glucuronide conjugates into the bile, then hydrolysis in the intestine and estrogen reabsorption. Sulfate conjugates are the primary form found in postmenopausal women. With transdermal application, less estradiol is metabolized leading to higher circulating concentrations of estradiol and lower concentrations of estrone and conjugates. </p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Primarily urine (as estradiol, estrone, estriol and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates) </p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Bound to sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Breast cancer, metastatic:</b> Treatment of metastatic breast cancer (palliation) in appropriately selected men and postmenopausal women.</p><p><b>Hypoestrogenism (female):</b> Treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure.</p><p><b>Osteoporosis prevention (female):</b> Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p><p>Limitations of use: For use only in women at significant risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis; consider use of nonestrogen medications.</p><p><b>Prostate cancer, advanced:</b> Treatment of androgen-dependent advanced prostatic cancer (palliation).</p><p><b>Vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause:</b> Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.</p><p><b>Vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause:</b> Treatment of moderate to severe vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause.</p><p>Limitations of use: When used solely for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, consider topical vaginal products.</p><p><b>Note: </b>The International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health and The North American Menopause Society have endorsed the term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) as new terminology for vulvovaginal atrophy.

However, if nutritional deficits persist, hormone replacement may not protect bone health.</p><h3>Hormone therapy for transgender females (male-to-female)</h3><p>Based on the Endocrine Society guidelines for the endocrine treatment of gender dysphoric/gender incongruent persons, estradiol as monotherapy or combination therapy, is effective for elevating serum estradiol levels and suppressing serum testosterone levels into the normal range for females, resulting in decreased hair growth, muscle mass, sexual desire, sperm production, spontaneous erections, and testicular volume, as well as breast growth, male sexual dysfunction, redistribution of body fat, and skin and voice changes. In many cases, estrogen therapy will need to be augmented with a second compound to suppress androgen secretion, such as spironolactone or a gonadotropin hormone-releasing agonist <sup>[ES [Hembree 2017]]</sup>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, or hypersensitivity to estradiol or any component of the formulation; undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; DVT or PE (current or history of); active or history of arterial thromboembolic disease (eg, stroke, MI); breast cancer (known, suspected or history of), except in appropriately selected patients being treated for metastatic disease; estrogen-dependent tumor (known or suspected); hepatic impairment or disease; known protein C, protein S, antithrombin deficiency or other known thrombophilic disorders; pregnancy (<b>Note:</b> Products approved for use only in postmenopausal patients are not appropriate for use in pregnancy; use of some products is specifically contraindicated in the manufacturer's labeling).</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for estrogens is limited.

Wash hands after application. Gel is flammable; avoid fire or flame until skin is dry.</p><p>Divigel: Apply the entire contents of packet to right or left upper thigh each day (alternate sites) over a ~5 x 7-inch area. Do not apply to face, breasts, vaginal area, or irritated skin. Do not wash application site for 1 hour. Allow gel to dry before dressing.</p><p>Elestrin: Apply the entire dose to upper arm and shoulder area using 2 fingers to spread gel. Do not apply to breasts or vaginal area. Allow skin to dry for ≥5 minutes prior to dressing. Prior to first use, pump must be primed. After priming, the pump contains 30 metered doses; discard pump after 30 doses even though container may not be empty. If &gt;1 dose is needed, wait 5 seconds before pumping next dose. To avoid secondary exposure, do not allow others to contact the application site for 2 hours after gel is applied. Allow at least 2 hours between applying gel and going swimming. Wait at least 25 minutes before applying sunscreen to application area. When sunscreen and gel are applied to the same site for &gt;7 consecutive days, the absorption of estradiol is increased; do not apply sunscreen to an area where the gel was applied for ≥7 consecutive days.</p><p>EstroGel: Apply dose into the palm of hand and then apply gel to the other arm, from the wrist to the shoulder. Do not apply to breasts or vaginal area. Spread gel as thinly as possible over one arm but do not massage or rub in gel. Allow skin to dry for 5 minutes before dressing. Prior to first use, pump must be primed. After priming, the pump contains 32 daily doses (50 g canister) or 14 daily doses (25 g canister). Discard pump after allotted doses even though container may not be empty. To avoid secondary exposure, do not allow others to contact the application site for ≥1 hour after gel is applied. Wait as long as possible between applying gel and going swimming. When sunscreen was applied 1 hour after the gel to the same site for &gt;7 consecutive days, the absorption of estradiol was decreased; when moisturizing lotion was applied 1 hour after the gel to the same site for &gt;7 consecutive days, the absorption of estradiol was increased. The effect of applying sunscreen or lotion prior to the gel has not been studied.</p><p>Spray: Evamist: Prior to first use, prime pump by spraying 3 sprays with the cover on. To administer dose, hold container upright and vertical and rest the plastic cone flat against the skin while spraying. Spray to the inner surface of the forearm, starting near the elbow. If more than one spray is needed, apply to adjacent but not overlapping areas. Apply at the same time each day. Allow spray to dry for ~2 minutes; do not rub into skin; do not cover with clothing until dry. Do not wash application site for at least 60 minutes. Apply to clean, dry, unbroken skin. Do not apply to skin other than that of the forearm. Make sure that children do not come in contact with any skin area where the drug was applied. If contact with children is unavoidable, wear a garment with long sleeves that covers the site of application. If direct exposure occurs, wash the child in the area of exposure with soap and water as soon as possible. Solution contained in the spray is flammable; avoid fire, flame, or smoking until spray has dried. If needed, apply sunscreen ~1 hour prior to application of Evamist.</p><p>Transdermal patch: General administration instructions (also refer to product labeling): Apply patch immediately after removing from protective pouch to lower abdomen or buttocks. Apply to clean, dry, healthy skin that is free of oil, powder, or lotion. Avoid waistline or other areas where tight clothing may rub the patch off; do not apply to breasts. After application, hold patch in place using palm of hand for 10 seconds. Rotate application sites allowing a 1-week interval between applications at a particular site. In general, if patch falls off, the same patch may be reapplied or a new system may be used for the remainder of the dosing interval. When replacing patch, reapply to a new site. Remove patch slowly after use to avoid skin irritation. If any adhesive remains on the skin after removal, first allow skin to dry for 15 minutes, then gently rub area with an oil-based cream or lotion. Dispose of any used or unused patches by folding adhesive ends together, replace in pouch or sealed container, and discard properly in trash away from children and pets.</p><p>Climara, Menostar: Swimming, bathing, or wearing patch while in a sauna have not been studied</p><p>Vaginal ring: Exact positioning is not critical for efficacy; however, patient should not feel anything once inserted. In case of discomfort, push ring further into vagina. If ring is expelled prior to 90 days, it may be rinsed off with warm water and reinserted. Ensure proper vaginal placement of the ring to avoid inadvertent urinary bladder insertion. Femring may remain in place during local treatment of a vaginal infection.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake when used for the prevention of osteoporosis.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store all products at controlled room temperature.

The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women ≥65 years of age during 4 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women.</p><p>Only daily oral CEs (0.625 mg) and daily oral CE (0.625 mg) and MPA (2.5 mg) were studied in the estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin substudies of the WHI, respectively. Therefore, the relevance of the WHI findings regarding the adverse cardiovascular events and dementia to lower CE doses, other routes of administration, or other estrogen alone products is not known. Likewise, the relevance of the WHI findings regarding the adverse cardiovascular events, dementia, and breast cancer to lower CE plus other MPA doses, other routes of administration, or other estrogen plus progestin products is not known. Without such data, it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of the risks for other products. Discuss with your patient the benefits and risks of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy, taking into account her individual risk profile. Prescribe estrogens with or without progestins at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.</p><p>Breast budding and breast masses in prepubertal females and gynecomastia and breast masses in prepubertal males have been reported following unintentional secondary exposure to Evamist by women using this product.

Advise patients to strictly adhere to recommended instructions for use.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical management has been reported and may develop at any time during therapy. Angioedema involving the face, feet, hands, larynx, and tongue has also been reported.</p><p>• Breast cancer: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Based on data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, an increased risk of invasive breast cancer was observed in postmenopausal women using conjugated estrogens (CE) in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).</b> Observational studies noted this risk declines once therapy is discontinued. The WHI study did not observe an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women with a hysterectomy using CE alone. The risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal patients on hormone therapy may depend upon type of estrogen and/or progestin, dose, timing of therapy initiation, duration of therapy, route of administration, and individual patient characteristics (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; NAMS 2017). Hormone therapy may be associated with increased breast density (NAMS 2017); an increase in abnormal mammogram findings requiring further evaluation has been reported with estrogen alone or in combination with progestin therapy. Estrogen use may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases; discontinue estrogen if hypercalcemia occurs.</p><p>• Dementia: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Do not use estrogens with or without progestin to prevent dementia. In the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), an increased incidence of probable dementia was observed in women ≥65 years of age taking CE alone or in combination with MPA.</b> Because the WHIMS was conducted in women ≥65 years of age, it is unknown if these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. However, hormone therapy is not recommended at any age to prevent or treat cognitive decline or dementia (AACE [Goodman 2011]; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Endometrial cancer: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: The use of unopposed estrogen in women with a uterus is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. The addition of a progestin to estrogen therapy may decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial cancer. Use adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling if indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.</b> There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens at equivalent estrogen doses. The risk of endometrial cancer appears to be dose and duration dependent, greatest with use ≥5 years, and may persist following discontinuation of therapy. The use of a progestin is not generally required when low doses of estrogen are used locally for vaginal atrophy, although long-term data (&gt;1 year) supporting this recommendation are lacking (NAMS 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Endometriosis: Estrogens may exacerbate endometriosis. Malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants has been reported posthysterectomy with unopposed estrogen therapy. Consider adding a progestin in women with residual endometriosis posthysterectomy.</p><p>• Lipid effects: Estrogen compounds are generally associated with lipid effects such as increased HDL-cholesterol and decreased LDL-cholesterol. Triglycerides may also be increased in women with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia; discontinue if pancreatitis occurs.</p><p>• Ovarian cancer: Available information related to the use of menopausal estrogen or estrogen/progestin therapy and risk of ovarian cancer is inconsistent. If an association is present, the absolute risk is likely rare and may be influenced by duration of therapy (AACE [Goodman 2011]; ES [Stuenkel 2015]; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: Estrogens may cause retinal vascular thrombosis; discontinue if migraine, loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, or other visual disturbances occur; discontinue permanently if papilledema or retinal vascular lesions are observed on examination.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Use caution with asthma; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Carbohydrate intolerance: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in patients with diabetes. Prior to therapy, consider age, cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in patients previously diagnosed with diabetes (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Do not use estrogens with or without progestin to prevent cardiovascular disease. Using data from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stroke has been reported with CEs and an increased risk of DVT, stroke, pulmonary emboli (PE) and myocardial infarction (MI) has been reported with CEs with MPA in postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age.</b> Additional risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus, obesity, tobacco use, and/or history of venous thromboembolism. Adverse cardiovascular events have also been reported in males taking estrogens for prostate cancer. Manage risk factors appropriately; discontinue use immediately if adverse cardiovascular events occur or are suspected. Due to possible lower risk of thrombotic events, transdermal administration may be preferred for treating vasomotor symptoms of menopause in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; ACOG 556 2013; ES [Stuenkel 2015]). Use is contraindicated in women with active DVT, PE, arterial thromboembolic disease (stroke and MI), or a history of these conditions.</p><p>• Diseases exacerbated by fluid retention: Use caution with diseases which may be exacerbated by fluid retention, including cardiac or renal dysfunction.</p><p>• Epilepsy: Use caution with epilepsy; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Gallbladder disease: Use of postmenopausal estrogen may be associated with an increased risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery.</p><p>• Hepatic dysfunction: Estrogens are poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Use caution with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with prior estrogen use or pregnancy. Discontinue if jaundice develops or if acute or chronic hepatic disturbances occur. Use is contraindicated with hepatic impairment or disease.</p><p>• Hepatic hemangiomas: Use caution with hepatic hemangiomas; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Hereditary angioedema: Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate angioedema symptoms in women with hereditary angioedema.</p><p>• Hypoparathyroidism: Use caution with hypoparathyroidism; estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.</p><p>• Migraine: Use caution with migraine; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• Porphyria: Use caution with porphyria; may exacerbate disease.</p><p>• SLE: Use caution with SLE; may exacerbate disease.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Thyroid replacement therapy: Estrogens may increase thyroid-binding globulin levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone while receiving estrogens.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Prior to puberty, estrogens may cause premature closure of the epiphyses. Premature breast development, vaginal bleeding, and vaginal cornification may be induced in girls. Modification of the normal puberty process may occur in boys.</p><p>• Surgical patients: Whenever possible, discontinue estrogens at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to elective surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immobilization.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Chlorobutanol: Some products may contain chlorobutanol (a chloral derivative) as a preservative, which may be habit forming.</p><p>• Tartrazine: Some products may contain tartrazine.</p><p>• Topical gel: Absorption of the topical gel (Elestrin) is increased by application of sunscreen; do not apply sunscreen within close proximity of estradiol. Application of sunscreen after EstroGel decreases absorption of estradiol, while application of moisturizer lotion after EstroGel increases the absorption of estradiol; the effect of applying sunscreen or lotion prior to Estrogel has not been studied. Application of Divigel with sunscreen has not been evaluated.</p><p>• Topical spray: When sunscreen is applied ~1 hour prior to the topical spray (Evamist), no change in absorption was observed (estradiol absorption was decreased when sunscreen is applied 1 hour after Evamist).</p><p>• Transdermal patch: May contain conducting metal (eg, aluminum); remove patch prior to MRI.</p><p>• Vaginal ring: Use may not be appropriate in women with narrow vagina, vaginal stenosis, vaginal infections, cervical prolapse, rectoceles, cystoceles, or other conditions that may increase the risk of vaginal irritation, ulceration, or increase the risk of expulsion. Remove ring in case of ulceration, erosion, or adherence to vaginal wall; do not reinsert until healing is complete. Ensure proper vaginal placement of the ring to avoid inadvertent urinary bladder insertion.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Duration of use: Extended use of menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for persistent vasomotor symptoms, issues related to quality of life, or for osteoporosis prevention in women at increased risk of fracture. Menopausal hormonal therapy does not need to be routinely discontinued in women &gt;60 years of age and may continue in women &gt;65 years of age after clinical evaluation and discussion of benefits and risks of treatment. Perform annual exams with a review of comorbidities; discuss possible adjustments to safer lower dose and/or route of administration (ACOG 565 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Genitourinary syndrome of menopause: Low-dose vaginal estrogen is preferred over systemic therapy for genitourinary syndrome of menopause in the absence of vasomotor symptoms due to increased efficacy and decreased systemic effects (eg, cardiovascular effects, cancer risk) (Crandall 2018; NAMS 2013; NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins). The dose, route, and the specific estrogen/progestin influence these changes.</p><p>• Osteoporosis use: In women with premature menopause, hormone therapy to prevent bone loss may be used unless otherwise contraindicated; reassess therapy when the average age of menopause is reached. It is also an appropriate bone-active therapy for women with vasomotor symptoms who are &lt;60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause onset. Use may be considered for women at high risk of fractures who are not candidates for other osteoporosis therapies (NAMS 2017).</p><p>• Risks vs benefits: When used for the relief of menopausal symptoms or increased risk of bone fracture/loss, the benefit-risk of hormone therapy is most favorable if started in patients who have no contraindications to therapy, are &lt;60 years of age, within 10 years of menopause onset, have a favorable lipid profile, and do not have the factor V Leiden genotype or metabolic syndrome. In addition, consider risk factors for cardiovascular disease when evaluating therapy and route of administration (AACE/ACE [Cobin 2017]; NAMS 2017). <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Prescribe estrogens with or without progestin at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.</b> Reevaluate patients as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary. Available data related to treatment risks are from Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies, which evaluated oral CE 0.625 mg with or without MPA 2.5 mg relative to placebo in postmenopausal women. <b>Other doses, routes of administration, and products were not studied; therefore, the relevance regarding adverse events is not known, and it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of the risks for other products.
