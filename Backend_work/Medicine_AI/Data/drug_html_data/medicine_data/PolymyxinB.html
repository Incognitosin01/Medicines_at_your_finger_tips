When intraventricular polymyxin B is administered via a ventricular drain, clamp drain for 15 to 60 minutes after administration (allows solution to equilibrate in CSF) (IDSA [Tunkel 2004]; IDSA [Tunkel 2017]). <b>Note:</b> Intraventricular administration is generally reserved for use in patients who fail parenteral therapy despite removal of CSF shunt or when CSF shunt cannot be removed (Baddour 2018).</p><p><b>Ocular infections:</b> Ophthalmic: A concentration of 0.1% to 0.25% (10,000 to 25,000 units/mL) is administered as 1 to 3 drops every hour, then increasing the interval as response indicates. A subconjunctival injection of up to 100,000 units/day may be used for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> corneal and conjunctival infections. <b>Note:</b> Avoid total systemic and ophthalmic doses of &gt;25,000 units/kg/<b>day</b>.</p><p><b>Systemic infections: Note:</b> Most of the available limited data evaluating polymyxin B for multidrug resistant pathogens cite manufacturer's labeling dosing of 15,000 to 25,000 units/kg/day IV divided every 12 hours (Furtado 2007; Ouderkirk 2003). More recent publications have cited alternate dosing regimens based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data (eg, Monte Carlo simulations) (Sandri 2013a), which support using a loading dose to rapidly achieve target serum concentrations and higher dosing regimens, particularly for severe infections (pathogens with an MIC ≤2 mcg/mL); however, actual clinical data employing these higher dosing regimens remain limited. Despite the paucity of data, loading doses are recommended in all patients, especially critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]). Monitor closely for nephrotoxicity. Dosing based on actual body weight has been suggested for patients within a normal weight range for their height (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]; Kassamali 2015; Pai 2013; Sandri 2013a).</p><p><b>Infections (eg, intraabdominal infections, meningitis, pneumonia [hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated], sepsis), due to susceptible (</b><b>MIC ≤2 mcg/mL)<b> multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (eg, </b><i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i></b> <i><b>Acinetobacter spp) </b></i><b>(off-label dose):</b></p><p>IV: Loading dose: 20,000 to 25,000 units/kg, followed by a maintenance dose of 12,500 to 15,000 units/kg every 12 hours (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]; Kassamali 2015; Sandri 2013a).</p><p><b>Note:</b> Safety data for doses &gt;30,000 units/kg/day or for single infusions &gt;2,000,000 units are limited (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]; John 2017; Sandri 2013b). Pharmacokinetic data do not support capping upper absolute dose although infusion-related adverse effects (eg, sudden thoracic pain, paresthesias, dizziness, dyspnea, hypoxemia) may increase with higher doses (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]; John 2017). To minimize bacterial regrowth and heteroresistance, consider use in combination with other antibiotics depending on infection site and susceptibilities (Bergen 2015; ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]; Kassamali 2015; Rigatto 2015).</p><p>Inhalation (off-label route): 500,000 units every 12 hours; an aerosolized beta-2 agonist should be given ~20 minutes prior to polymyxin B (Pereira 2007). <b>Note:</b> In the treatment of pneumonia, concomitant IV administration may also be necessary (Pereira 2007).</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: </b>Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Due to toxicity risks, the systemic use of polymyxin B should be limited to life-threatening, multidrug-resistant infection when less toxic alternatives are not effective or not tolerated. Multiple routes of administration available for use (eg, IV, IM, intrathecal, ophthalmic) and dosing differs based upon route; use extra caution in verification of dose and route of administration. Dosing presented in units; 10,000 units = 1 mg; use extra caution with prescribing and/or dispensing.</p><p><b>Severe, life-threatening, multidrug-resistant infection (excluding meningitis): Note:</b> From experience in adult patients, safety data for single doses &gt;30,000 units/kg/dose or total daily doses &gt;2,000,000 units<b>/day </b>are extremely limited (Kassamali 2015).

Based on adult recommendations, a loading dose of 25,000 units/kg has also been recommended (Chiotos 2020).</p><p>IM: 25,000 to 40,000 units/kg/<b>day</b> divided every 4 to 6 hours. <b>Note:</b> Routine IM administration not recommended due to severe pain at injection site.</p><p>Children and Adolescents:</p><p>IV: Usual dose: 25,000 to 30,000 units/kg/<b>day</b> divided every 12 hours; reported range: 15,000 to 40,000 units/kg/<b>day</b> (Bradley 2019; Chiotos 2020; Hoeprich 1970; Siddiqui 2014; manufacturer's labeling). Manufacturer's labeling recommends a maximum dose of 25,000 units/kg/<b>day</b>; however, doses up to 40,000 units/kg/<b>day</b> have been reported in patients ≤12 years in a small case series (Siddiqui 2014).</p><p>IM: 25,000 to 30,000 units/kg/<b>day</b> divided every 4 to 6 hours; <b>Note:</b> Routine IM administration not recommended due to severe pain at injection site.</p><p><b>CNS infection (including meningitis, ventriculitis, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] shunt infections):</b></p><p>Manufacturer's labeling:</p><p>Children &lt;2 years: Intrathecal: 20,000 units<b>/dose</b> once daily for 3 to 4 days <b>or</b> 25,000 units<b>/dose</b> once every other day; continue 25,000 units<b>/dose</b> once every other day for at least 2 weeks after cultures of the CSF are negative.</p><p>Children ≥2 years and Adolescents: Intrathecal: 50,000 units<b>/dose</b> daily for 3 to 4 days, then every other day for at least 2 weeks after cultures of CSF are negative.</p><p>Alternate recommendations: Limited data available: Children and Adolescents: Intraventricular or intrathecal: 20,000 to 50,000 units/day; due to the smaller CSF volume in infants, some guidelines recommend decreasing the infant dose; because adult dosage recommendations are based on ventricle size, smaller doses should be used in smaller patients (Hoeprich 1970; Landman 2008; IDSA [Tunkel 2004]; IDSA [Tunkel 2017]).</p><p><b>Ocular infections:</b> Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Ophthalmic:</p><p>Topical: 0.1% to 0.25% solution (prepared from parenteral injection): 1 to 3 drops every hour, then increasing the interval as response indicates.</p><p>Subconjunctival injection: Up to 100,000 units/day not to exceed 25,000 units/<b>kg</b>/day.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Combined total therapy (systemic and ophthalmic instillation) should not exceed 25,000 units/kg/<b>day.</b></p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Infusion-related adverse effects may increase with higher doses (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]; John 2017). Due to minimal data in morbidly obese patients, consider dosing based on adjusted body weight in these patients (Kassamali 2015; Pai 2013; Sandri 2013a).</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>IV infusion: Dissolve 500,000 units in 300 to 500 mL D5W</p><p>IM injection: Dissolve 500,000 units in 2 mL NS, or 1% procaine HCl</p><p>Intrathecal: Dissolve 500,000 units in 10 mL NS (preservative free) (concentration: 50,000 units/mL)</p><p>Ophthalmic: Dissolve 500,000 units in 20 to 50 mL SWFI or NS (concentration: 10,000 to 25,000 units/mL [0.1 to 0.25%])</p><h2>Administration</h2><p><b>IV:</b> Infuse over 1 hour (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]).</p><p><b>Inhalation for nebulization</b> (off-label use/route): Use with standard jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor; an aerosolized beta-2 agonist should be given ~20 minutes prior to polymyxin (Pereira 2007).</p><p><b>Intrathecal/intraventricular:</b> May be administered intrathecally; intrathecal injections should only be administered in a hospital.

Patients with nephrotoxicity due to polymyxin B sulfate usually show albuminuria, cellular casts, and azotemia. Diminishing urine output and a rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are indications for discontinuing therapy with this drug.</p><p>Neurotoxic reactions may be manifested by irritability, weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, perioral paresthesia, numbness of the extremities, and blurring of vision. These are usually associated with high serum levels found in patients with impaired renal function and/or nephrotoxicity.</p><p>The concurrent or sequential use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic drugs with polymyxin B sulfate, particularly bacitracin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, cephaloridine, paromomycin, viomycin, and colistin should be avoided.</p><p>The neurotoxicity of polymyxin B sulfate can result in respiratory paralysis from neuromuscular blockade, especially when the drug is given soon after anesthesia or muscle relaxants.</p><p>The safety of this drug in human pregnancy has not been established.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Local reactions: May cause severe pain at IM injection site or thrombophlebitis at IV infusion site.</p><p>• Nephrotoxicity: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: May cause nephrotoxicity; avoid concurrent or sequential use of other nephrotoxic drugs.</b> Usual risk factors include preexisting renal impairment, advanced age and dehydration. Polymyxin B-induced nephrotoxicity may be manifested by albuminuria, cellular casts, and azotemia; monitor BUN, serum creatinine, and urinary analysis at baseline and as clinically indicated. Discontinue therapy with decreasing urinary output and increasing BUN. Data suggest polymyxin B undergoes a selective uptake process into renal cells, which plays a primary role in nephrotoxicity potential (Abdelraouf 2014). One small study in patients receiving polymyxin B with a normal baseline renal function observed an overall prevalence rate of nephrotoxicity of 46% with a median onset of 9 days (Dubrovaskaya 2015).</p><p>• Neurotoxicity: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: May cause neurotoxicity, which can also result in respiratory paralysis from neuromuscular blockade especially when the drug is given soon after anesthesia or muscle relaxants. Avoid concurrent or sequential use of other neurotoxic drugs.</b> Avoid concurrent use of curariform muscle relaxants and other neurotoxic drugs (eg, ether, tubocurarine, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium, sodium citrate), which may cause respiratory depression.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>C. difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with impaired renal function; manufacturer’s prescribing information states dosage reduction required, however, recent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical studies suggest daily dose requirement is not affected by renal function (Sandri 2013a; Nelson 2015; Thamlikitkul 2016).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pregnancy: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Safety in pregnant women not established.</b></p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• IM/Intrathecal/IV administration: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Intramuscular/intrathecal/intravenous administration only to hospitalized patients.</b></p><p>• Parenteral administration: Polymyxin B sulfate is most toxic when given parenterally; avoid parenteral use whenever possible.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Neurologic symptoms and signs of superinfection; renal function (decreasing urine output and increasing BUN may require discontinuance of therapy); polymyxin serum concentrations (to ensure adequate drug exposure particularly early in therapy) (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: Safety in pregnancy has not been established.</b></p><p>Limited data related to systemic use in pregnancy are available (Heinonen 1977; Kazy 2005). Based on the relative toxicity compared to other antibiotics, systemic use in pregnancy is not recommended (Knothe 1985). Due to poor tissue diffusion, topical use would be expected to have only minimal risk to the mother or fetus (Leachman 2006).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat bacterial infections.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
