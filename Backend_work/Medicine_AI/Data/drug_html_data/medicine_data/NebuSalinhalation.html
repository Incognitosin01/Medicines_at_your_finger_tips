Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>NebuSal is given using a nebulizer. You will inhale the medication through a face mask, mouth piece, or other device connected to the nebulizer.</p><p>Your doctor, nurse, or other healthcare provider can show you how to properly use the nebulizer.</p><p>NebuSal is a liquid that is placed into the medication chamber of the nebulizer. A mouthpiece or face mask is then attached to the drug chamber, along with an air compressor.</p><p>To prepare for inhaling NebuSal through a nebulizer, you may be given another inhaled medication to prevent bronchospasm (muscle contractions within the airways of the lungs). Your doctor may also ask you to blow your nose, rinse your mouth with water, or wipe the inside of your mouth with a tissue. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully for best results.</p><p>In most cases, you will use this medication while you are sitting upright in a comfortable position. Breathe slowly and evenly while you are using the mask, mouthpiece, or other breathing device. You may also be given a nose clip to wear that will close your nasal passages so that you inhale only through your mouth.</p><p>If you are using this medication as part of a sputum test, you will need to spit about every 5 minutes or as directed by your healthcare provider. Cough deeply from your chest to produce an optimal specimen for testing.</p><p>Continue breathing through the nebulizer for as long as directed by your doctor. Once you have completed the inhalation for the prescribed amount of time, throw away any liquid that is left in the medicine chamber. Do not save it for later use.</p><p>If you store NebuSal at home, keep it at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since  NebuSal is sometimes used only as needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. If you are using the medication regularly, use the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  NebuSal?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">NebuSal side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Tell your caregiver right away if you have:</p><ul>
