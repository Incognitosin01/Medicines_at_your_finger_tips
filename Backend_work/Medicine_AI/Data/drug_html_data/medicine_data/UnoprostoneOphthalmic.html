It is also used to treat a condition called ocular hypertension (hypertension of the eye).</p><p>Unoprostone is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using unoprostone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For unoprostone, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to unoprostone or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on unoprostone have been done only in adult patients and there is no specific information comparing use of ophthalmic unoprostone in children with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Unoprostone has been tested and has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of unoprostone</h2><p>To use the eye drops:</p><ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.</li>
<li>To keep unoprostone as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed.</li>
</ul><p>Use unoprostone only as directed. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of too much medicine being absorbed into the body and the chance of side effects.</p><p>If you wear contact lenses: These eye drops contain a preservative that could be absorbed by the contact lenses. Wait at least 15 minutes after putting these drops in before you put in your contact lenses.</p><p>If your doctor ordered two different eye drops to be used together, wait at least 5 minutes between the times you apply the medicines.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of unoprostone will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of unoprostone. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
