</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Ophthalmic anti-inflammatory medicines are used in the eye to lessen problems that can occur during or after some kinds of eye surgery. Sometimes, the pupil of the eye gets smaller during an operation. This makes it more difficult for the surgeon to reach some areas of the eye. Some of these medicines are used to help prevent this. Also, some of them are used after eye surgery, to relieve effects such as inflammation or edema (too much fluid in the eye).</p><p>These medicines may also be used for other conditions, as determined by your ophthalmologist (eye doctor).</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>These medicines have been studied only in adults, and there is no specific information about their use in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>These medicines have been tested and have not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in older people than they do in younger adults.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Although studies on birth defects have not been done in pregnant women after use of these medicines in the eye, ophthalmic anti-inflammatory medicines have not been reported to cause birth defects or other problems. Studies have been done in animals receiving anti-inflammatory medicines by mouth in amounts that are much greater than the amounts used in the eye. These medicines did not cause birth defects in these studies. However, they decreased the weight or slowed the growth of the fetus and caused other, more serious, harmful effects on the fetus when they were given in amounts that were large enough to cause harmful effects in the mother. Also, when these medicines were given to animals late in pregnancy, they increased the length of pregnancy or prolonged labor.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>It is not known whether any of these medicines pass into the breast milk after they are placed in the eye. Diclofenac, indomethacin, and suprofen pass into the breast milk when they are are taken by mouth. It is not known whether flurbiprofen passes into the breast milk when it is taken by mouth. However, these medicines have not been shown to cause problems in nursing babies.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with a medication in this class or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Hemophilia or other bleeding problems—The possibility of bleeding may be increased.</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p><i>To use</i>:</p><ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.</li>
<li>Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.</li>
<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, always keep the container tightly closed.</li>
</ul><p><i>Do not use this medicine more often or for a longer time than your doctor ordered</i>. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p><i>Do not use any leftover medicine for future eye problems without first checking with your doctor</i>. If certain kinds of infection are present, using this medicine may make the infection worse and possibly lead to eye damage.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients.
