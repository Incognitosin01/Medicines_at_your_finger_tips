</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">HYCAMTIN is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to topotecan. Reactions have included anaphylactoid reactions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">HYCAMTIN can cause severe myelosuppression. The following safety data are based on an integrated safety database from four trials in patients with lung cancer (N = 682) who received Hycamtin Capsules at a dose of 2.3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> orally once daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.</p><p>The median day for neutrophil and platelet nadirs occurred on Day 15. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 32% of the 682 patients, with a median duration of 7 days. Grade 4 neutropenia most commonly occurred during cycle 1 (20% of patients). Clinical sequelae of neutropenia included infection (17%), febrile neutropenia (4%), sepsis (2%), and septic death (1%). Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 6%, with a median duration of 3 days. Grade 3 or 4 anemia occurred in 25%.</p><p>HYCAMTIN can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain.</p><p>Administer the first cycle of Hycamtin Capsules only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. Monitor blood cell counts frequently during treatment. Withhold and reduce dose of Hycamtin Capsules based on neutrophil counts, platelet counts and hemoglobin levels <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Diarrhea, including severe and life-threatening diarrhea requiring hospitalization, can occur with Hycamtin Capsules. Diarrhea can occur at the same time as drug-induced neutropenia and its sequelae. In the 682 patients who received Hycamtin Capsules in the four lung cancer trials, the incidence of diarrhea caused by Hycamtin Capsules was 22%, including Grade 3 (4%) and Grade 4 (0.4%). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea proximate (within 5 days) to Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 5%. The median time to onset of Grade 2 to 4 diarrhea was 9 days in the group receiving Hycamtin Capsules.</p><p>Monitor patients for diarrhea and treat with antidiarrheals at the first sign of diarrhea. Withhold and dose reduce as recommended based on severity <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Interstitial Lung Disease</h3><p class="First">Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities, can occur with HYCAMTIN. Underlying risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, thoracic radiation, and use of pneumotoxic drugs or colony stimulating factors.</p><p>Monitor for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. Permanently discontinue Hycamtin Capsules if ILD is confirmed.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on animal data, HYCAMTIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis. Advise women of the potential risk to fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose of Hycamtin Capsules. Advise males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Hycamtin Capsules and for 3 months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclincial Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Myelosuppression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Diarrhea <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data in the Warnings and Precautions and below reflects exposure to Hycamtin Capsules in 682 patients with recurrent lung cancer enrolled in four randomized, open label trials, including 275 patients with small lung cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Studies 478, 065 and 396), and 407 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Study 387), who received at least one dose of Hycamtin Capsules. Patients in these trials had advanced lung cancer and received prior chemotherapy in the first-line setting. Patients received Hycamtin Capsules 2.3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> orally once daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The median number of cycles was 3 (range: 1 to 20).</p><p>The safety of Hycamtin Capsules was evaluated in a randomized trial (Study 478) conducted in 70 patients with recurrent SCLC <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>In the 682 patients who received Hycamtin Capsules in the four lung cancer trials, 39 deaths (6%) occurred within 30 days after the last dose for a reason other than progressive disease: 13 due to hematologic toxicity, 5 due to non-hematologic toxicity (2 from diarrhea), and 21 due to other causes.</p><p>Table 1 describes the hematologic and non-hematologic adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 5% of patients treated with Hycamtin Capsules in these trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hycamtin Capsules With Best<br/>

Avoid concomitant use Hycamtin Capsules with P-gp inhibitors or BCRP inhibitors.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, HYCAMTIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available clinical data on the use of HYCAMTIN in pregnancy. Topotecan caused embryolethality, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis at doses similar to the clinical dose <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In rabbits, an intravenous dose of 0.10 mg/kg/day [about equal to the 1.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> clinical intravenous dose based on body surface area (BSA)] given on days 6 through 20 of gestation caused maternal toxicity, embryolethality, and reduced fetal body weight. In the rat, an intravenous dose of 0.23 mg/kg/day (about equal to the 1.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> clinical intravenous dose based on BSA) given for 14 days before mating through gestation day 6 caused fetal resorption, microphthalmia, pre-implant loss, and mild maternal toxicity. Administration of an intravenous dose of 0.10 mg/kg/day (about half the 1.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> clinical intravenous dose based on BSA) to rats on days 6 through 17 of gestation caused an increase in post-implantation mortality. This dose also caused an increase in total fetal malformations. The most frequent malformations were of the eye (microphthalmia, anophthalmia, rosette formation of the retina, coloboma of the retina, ectopic orbit), brain (dilated lateral and third ventricles), skull, and vertebrae.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of topotecan or its metabolites in human milk, or their effects on the breastfed infant or milk production. Lactating rats excrete high concentrations of topotecan into milk (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with HYCAMTIN and for 1 week after the last dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Following intravenous administration of topotecan to lactating rats at a dose of 4.72 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (about twice the 1.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> clinical intravenous dose based on BSA), topotecan was excreted into milk at concentrations up to 48-fold higher than those in plasma.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span></p><p>Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Hycamtin Capsules <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p>HYCAMTIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Hycamtin Capsules and for 6 months after the last dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Males</span></p><p>Hycamtin Capsules may damage spermatozoa, resulting in possible genetic and fetal abnormalities. Advise males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Hycamtin Capsules and for 3 months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>HYCAMTIN can have both acute and long-term effects on fertility <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Males</span></p><p>Effects on spermatogenesis have occurred in animals administered topotecan <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 682 patients with lung cancer who received Hycamtin Capsules in the four clinical trials, 33% were aged 65 years and older, while 4.8% were aged 75 years and older. Treatment-related diarrhea was more frequent in patients aged greater than or equal to 65 years (28%) compared with those younger than 65 years (19%) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years and older and younger patients.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) greater than or equal to 50 mL/min. Reduce the dose of Hycamtin Capsules in patients with CLcr less than 49 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdoses (up to 5-fold of the prescribed dose) have occurred in patients receiving Hycamtin Capsules. The primary complication of overdosage is myelosuppression. Mucositis have occurred with overdosages. If an overdose is suspected, monitor the patient closely for myelosuppression and institute supportive-care measures as appropriate.</p><h2>Hycamtin Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Topotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor. The chemical name for topotecan hydrochloride is (<span class="Italics">S</span>)-10-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-4-ethyl-4,9-dihydroxy-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-pyrano[3',4':6,7] indolizino [1,2-<span class="Italics">b</span>]quinoline-3,14-(4<span class="Italics">H</span>,12<span class="Italics">H</span>)-dione monohydrochloride. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">23</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>•HCl and the molecular weight is 457.9 g/mol. It is soluble in water and melts with decomposition at 213°C to 218°C.</p><p>Topotecan hydrochloride has the following structural formula:</p><p>Hycamtin Capsules, contain topotecan hydrochloride, the content of which is expressed as topotecan free base. Each 0.25 mg and 1 mg capsule contain topotecan hydrochloride equivalent to 0.25 mg and 1 mg topotecan free-base, respectively. The excipients are gelatin, glyceryl monostearate, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and titanium dioxide. The capsules are imprinted with edible black ink. The 1 mg capsules also contain red iron oxide.</p><h2>Hycamtin Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents re-ligation of these single-strand breaks. The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis, when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan, topoisomerase I, and DNA. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following administration of Hycamtin Capsules at doses of 1.2 to 3.1 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (0.52 to 1.35 times the recommended dose) administered daily for 5 days, the area under the curve (AUC) increased proportionally with dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The time to the peak plasma concentrations is between 1 to 2 hours following oral administration. The oral bioavailability of topotecan is approximately 40%.</p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></p><p>Following a high-fat meal, the AUC was similar in the fed and fasted states, while T<span class="Sub">max</span> was delayed from 1.5 to 3 hours for topotecan lactone and from 3 to 4 hours for total topotecan.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Protein binding of topotecan is approximately 35%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The mean terminal half-life (t½) of topotecan is 3 to 6 hours following oral administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Topotecan undergoes a reversible pH-dependent hydrolysis of a pharmacologically active lactone moiety. At pH less than or equal to 4, the lactone is exclusively present, whereas the ring-opened hydroxy-acid form predominates at physiologic pH. The mean metabolite: parent AUC ratio was less than 10% for total topotecan and topotecan lactone.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>The overall recovery of drug-related material following 5 daily doses of topotecan was 57% of the administered oral dose. In the urine, 20% of the orally administered dose was excreted as total topotecan and 2% was excreted as N-desmethyl topotecan. Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 33%, while fecal elimination of the active metabolite N-desmethyl topotecan accounted for 1.5%. Overall, the N-desmethyl metabolite contributed a mean of less than 6% (range: 4% to 8%) of the total drug-related material accounted for in the urine and feces.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan were observed based on age, sex, or hepatic impairment following oral administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Racial and Ethnic Groups</span></p><p>In patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) greater than 80 mL/min, the dose-normalized AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> to topotecan lactone and total topotecan each were approximately 30% higher in Asians compared to Whites</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The mean dose-normalized for total topotecan and topotecan lactone AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> increased in advanced cancer patients with renal impairment compared to patients with CLcr greater than 80 mL/min as presented in Table 2 <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.

Nevertheless, topotecan is known to be genotoxic to mammalian cells and is a probable carcinogen. Topotecan was mutagenic to L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells and clastogenic to cultured human lymphocytes with and without metabolic activation. It was also clastogenic to mouse bone marrow. Topotecan did not cause mutations in bacterial cells.</p><p>Topotecan given to female rats prior to mating at an intravenous dose of 1.4 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> [(about 0.6 times the 2.3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> oral clinical dose based on body surface area (BSA)] caused superovulation possibly related to inhibition of follicular atresia.

Studies in dogs given an intravenous dose of 0.4 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (about 0.2 times the 2.3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> oral clinical dose based on BSA) of topotecan daily for a month suggest that treatment may cause an increase in the incidence of multinucleated spermatogonial giant cells in the testes.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of Hycamtin Capsules was studied in 141 patients with relapsed SCLC in a randomized, controlled, open-label trial (Study 478). The patients were prior responders (complete or partial) to first-line chemotherapy, were not considered candidates for standard intravenous chemotherapy and had relapsed at least 45 days from the end of first-line chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to Hycamtin Capsules (2.3 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> orally once daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle) with best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS).</p><p>Patients randomized to Hycamtin Capsules with BSC received a median of 4 courses (range: 1 to 10) and maintained a median dose intensity of 3.77 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/week. The median patient age in patients receiving Hycamtin Capsules with BSC and BSC alone was 60 years and 58 years, while the percentage of patients aged greater than or equal to 65 years was 34% and 29%, respectively. The majority of patients were White (99%) and male (73%). In the Hycamtin Capsules with BSC arm, 68% of patients had extensive disease and 28% had liver metastasis. In the BSC alone arm, 61% had extensive disease and 20% had liver metastases. Eighty percent of patients receiving Hycamtin Capsules with BSC previously received carboplatin or cisplatin and 77% of patients in the BSC alone arm received prior carboplatin or cisplatin. In the arm receiving Hycamtin Capsules with BSC, 18% of patients had prior carboplatin and 62% had prior cisplatin. In the BSC-alone arm, 26% of patients had prior carboplatin and 51% had prior cisplatin.</p><p>The arm receiving Hycamtin Capsules with BSC showed a statistically significant improvement in OS compared with the BSC-alone arm (Log-rank P = 0.0104).
