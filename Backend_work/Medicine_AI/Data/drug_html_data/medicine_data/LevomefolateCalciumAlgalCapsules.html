About 70% of food folate and cellular folate is comprised of L-methylfolate. It is the primary form of folate in circulation, and is also the form transported across membranes – particularly across the blood brain barrier – into peripheral tissues. In the cell, L-methylfolate is used in the remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate (THF). L-methylfolate is converted into functional, metabolically active coenzyme forms for use in the body, and supplies the active folate substrate, THF for use in transformylation and methylation biochemistry.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>Folates are best known for reducing the incidence of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs).<span class="Sup">2,3,4</span> NTDs are congenital malformations produced by failure of the neural tube to form and close properly during embryonic development.<span class="Sup">4,5</span> During the first four weeks of pregnancy – when many women do not even realize that they have conceived, adequate maternal folate intake is essential to reduce the risk of NTDs. Folate is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoiesis. It also promotes white blood cell (WBC) and platelet production in folate-deficiency anemia. Folate is associated with methylation and transformylation biochemistry. Folate is involved in transformylation and methylation metabolism as well as, indirectly, succinylation metabolism (through the “methyl trap” hypothesis). Folate plays a central role in the formation of nucleic acid precursors, such as thymidylic acid and purine nucleotides, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and cell division. IOM/NAS (1998) noted that the evidence for a protective effect from folate supplements is much stronger than that for food folate.<span class="Sup">4</span> Other ingredients are added to folate as cofactors, coenzymes and co-metabolites; in studies by Czeizel and Dudas (1992) and Berry et al. (1999), factors other than folate intake may affect the magnitude of risk reduction or participate in a co-protective effect with folate.<span class="Sup">4,5</span></p><p>Folate supplementation increases BH<span class="Sub">4</span> synthesis through a pterin “salvage pathway”, which converts sepiapterin/dihydrobiopterin (BH<span class="Sub">2</span>) to BH<span class="Sub">4</span> through the enzymatic activity of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Additionally, L-methylfolate may enhance or even “stand in” for BH<span class="Sub">4</span>. BH<span class="Sub">4</span> can also be regenerated from quinonoid dihydrobiopterin by dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) and synthesized de novo by conversion from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). BH<span class="Sub">4</span> functions as a cofactor for the enzymes responsible for the production of monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, epinephrine, dopamine). BH<span class="Sub">4</span> is the cofactor for conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. Tyrosine is then converted into DOPA, and eventually to norepinephrine and epinephrine. The conversion of tryptophan to serotonin also requires BH<span class="Sub">4</span>.</p><p>FOLATE REGULATION: The Federal Register Notices from 1971 to 1973 establish that increased folate is proper supplement in megaloblastic anemias of tropical and nontropical sprue, nutritional origin, pregnancy, infancy and childhood.<span class="Sup">6,7</span> Folate metabolism may be affected by malabsorption issues that differ widely among population groups. The March 5, 1996 Federal Register Notice (61 FR 8760) states “The agency concluded that the scientific literature did not support the superiority of any one source of folate over others, and that the data were insufficient to provide a basis for stating that a specific amount of folate is more effective than another amount [emphasis added].<span class="Sup">1</span> The actual amount and source of folate require the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner to achieve a satisfactory maintenance level, and may exceed the 0.8 mg UL. The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) specifically states that “dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription (21 CFR 121.1134). Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription. Oral preparations supplying more than 0.8 mg of folate per dosage unit would be restricted to prescription dispensing and that a dietary supplement furnishing 0.8 mg could be prescribed when a maintenance level of 0.8 mg per day was indicated.<span class="Sup">7</span>” When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture and/or CSF folate levels have become normal, a maintenance level should be used. "Patients should be kept under supervision of a licensed practitioner and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent. In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased [emphasis added].<span class="Sup">9</span>” In the Letter Regarding Dietary Supplement Health Claim for Folic Acid, Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>, and Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> and Vascular Disease (Docket No. 99P-3029) dated November 28, 2000, FDA wrote “... high intakes of folate may partially and temporarily correct pernicious anemia while the neurological damage of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency progresses. IOM/NAS (1998) set the UL for all adults of 1 mg per day because of devastating and irreversible neurological consequences of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, the data suggesting that pernicious anemia may develop at a younger age in some racial or ethnic groups, and the uncertainty about the extent of the occurrence of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency in younger age groups (IOM/NAS, 1998) [emphasis added].<span class="Sup">8</span>”</p><p>Summary: This product is a dietary management / prescription folate that, due to advanced folate levels, requires administration under the care of a licensed medical practitioner. The "Rx" on the label is to ensure prescription dispensing and that the product is administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner due to the increased risk associated with masking of B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency (pernicious anemia). The "Rx" status and a National Drug Code (NDC), or similar Product Code, facilitate pedigree reporting requirements and supply-chain control as well as, in some cases, insurance-reimbursement applications.</p><p>These statements have not been evaluate by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the articles contained in this product. This product is contraindicated for individuals with conditions for which any of the ingredients are contraindicated.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Caution is recommended in patients with a family history of bipolar illness. Mood elevation is possible in this population.</p><p>Caution is also recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as folate may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold. Furthermore, it has been reported that anticonvulsant medications interfere with folate metabolism, but the exact action is unclear; therefore caution is recommended with patients in this therapeutic group.</p><p>Patients undergoing cancer treatment should consult their licensed medical practitioner for advice.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Folate alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations progress. Daily ingestion of more than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, ALA, and EPA) may have potential antithrombotic activities, or effects, and may increase bleeding times. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis, including those taking anticoagulants. Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral folate.<span class="Sup">9</span></p><p>Call your licensed medical practitioner about side effects.</p><h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Talk to your licensed medical practitioner, healthcare practitioner, personal physician, and/or pharmacist before taking or using any prescription, over-the-counter medicines, or herbal/health supplements alongside this product. Drugs which may interact with folate include:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Antiepileptic drugs (AED): The AED class including, but not limited to, phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone, valproic acid, fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital and lamotrigine have been shown to impair folate absorption and increase the metabolism of circulating folate.<br/></li>
<li>Additionally, concurrent use of folic acid has been associated with enhanced phenytoin metabolism, lowering the level of the AED in the blood and allowing breakthrough seizures to occur. Caution should be used when prescribing this product among patients who are receiving treatment with phenytoin and other anticonvulsants.<br/></li>
<li>Cholestyramine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.<br/></li>
<li>Colestipol: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.<br/>
Cycloserine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.<br/></li>
<li>Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine exerts a noncompetitive inhibition of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate active transport in the intestine.<br/></li>
<li>Isotretinoin: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking isotretinoin.<br/></li>
<li>L-dopa, triamterene, colchicine, and trimethoprim may decrease plasma folate levels.<br/></li>
<li>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit some folate dependent enzymes in laboratory experiments.<br/></li>
<li>NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and sulindac.<br/></li>
<li>Oral Contraceptives: Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.<br/></li>
<li>Methylprednisolone: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted after treatment with methylprednisolone.<br/></li>
<li>Pancreatic Enzymes: Reduced serum folate levels have occurred in some patients taking pancreatic extracts, such as pancreatin and pancrelipase.<br/></li>
<li>Pentamidine: Reduced folate levels have been seen with prolonged intravenous pentamidine.<br/></li>
<li>Pyrimethamine: High levels of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of pyrimethamine.<br/></li>
<li>Smoking and Alcohol: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted.<br/></li>
<li>Sulfasalazine: Inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid. Metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes decreases serum folate.<br/></li>
<li>Warfarin can produce significant impairment in folate status after a 6-month therapy.<br/></li>
<li>Caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of folinic acid and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection as it is associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study.</li>
