Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and apnea, including the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation. Remimazolam has been associated with hypoxia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and during the recovery period. Resuscitative drugs, and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of remimazolam.</p><p>Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including remimazolam, and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The sedative effect of intravenous remimazolam can be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications, including other benzodiazepines and propofol. Continuously monitor patients for respiratory depression and depth of sedation.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, pruritus, and anaphylaxis, may occur due to the presence of dextran.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment; carefully titrate to effect; lower frequency of supplemental doses may be needed.</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues: </b></i></p><p>• Concomitant use with opioids:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including remimazolam, and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; sedative effect may be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications, including other benzodiazepines and propofol. </b>These respiratory effects are more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III or IV patients.<b> Continuously monitor patients for respiratory depression and depth of sedation.</b></p><p>• Drug-drug interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy. Consult drug interactions database for more detailed information.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Elderly patients: Potential for faster onset of loss of consciousness and longer duration of action. Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; use with caution.</p><p>• Pediatric: Neurotoxicity may occur in pediatric patients (unapproved use), particularly after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life, which may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects; weigh benefits against risks of anesthesia prior to elective procedures.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Personnel and equipment for monitoring and resuscitation: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation should administer remimazolam and must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and apnea, including the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation.

Based on data from other benzodiazepines, neonatal hypotonia, lethargy, respiratory depression, sedation, and withdrawal symptoms may occur following in utero exposure to remimazolam.</p><p>Based on animal data, repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic and sedation medications that block N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity may affect brain development.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women should not be denied medically necessary surgery regardless of trimester. If the procedure is elective, it should be delayed until after delivery (ACOG 775 2019).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to calm you before a procedure.</p><p>• It is used to cause sleep during a procedure.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug. Tell your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms that may be related to a very bad side effect:</b></p><p>• High or low blood pressure like very bad headache or dizziness, passing out, or change in eyesight</p><p>• Fast heartbeat</p><p>• Slow heartbeat</p><p>• Signs of an allergic reaction, like rash; hives; itching; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever; wheezing; tightness in the chest or throat; trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking; unusual hoarseness; or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Note:</b> This is not a comprehensive list of all side effects.
