Antihemophilic and von Willebrand factors are naturally occurring proteins in the blood that help the blood to clot.</p><p>A lack of antihemophilic factor VIII is the cause of hemophilia A. A lack of von Willebrand factor is the cause of von Willebrand disease. This medicine works by temporarily raising levels of factor VIII or von Willebrand factor in the blood to aid in clotting.</p><p>Wilate is used to treat bleeding episodes in people with von Willebrand disease.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Wilate if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to antihemophilic factor in the past.</p><p><b>Carefully follow all instructions about how to store this medicine.</b> Each brand of antihemophilic and von Willebrand factor complex may have specific storage instructions.</p><h2>Before using this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Wilate if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to antihemophilic factor.</p><p>To make sure you can safely use this medication, tell your doctor if you have ever had a stroke or a blood clot.</p><p>Your doctor may want you to receive a hepatitis vaccination before you start using Wilate.</p><p>It is not known whether Wilate will harm an unborn baby.
