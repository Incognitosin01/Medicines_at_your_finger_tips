Increase dose by 25 or 50 units at weekly intervals until follicular growth indicates an adequate ovarian response. The maximum (individualized) daily dose that has been safely used for ovulation induction in patients during clinical trials is 250 units. If response to follitropin is appropriate, hCG is given 1 day following the last dose to induce final oocyte maturation and ovulation. Follow current clinical practice to reduce the risk of OHSS. See <b>"Note"</b> for dosage adjustment for the pen with cartridge.</p><p><i>Puregon (vials) [Canadian product] (IM, SubQ), Puregon Cartridge [Canadian product] (SubQ): </i>Stepwise approach: Initiate therapy with 50 units/day for at least the first 7 days. Increase dose gradually until follicular growth and/or plasma estradiol levels indicate an adequate response (daily increase of estradiol levels of 40% to 100% is considered optimal). If response to follitropin is appropriate, hCG is given 1 day following the last dose to induce final oocyte maturation and ovulation. Decrease hCG dose if the number of responding follicles is too high or estradiol levels increase too rapidly (eg, greater than daily doubling for estradiol for 2 or 3 consecutive days); withhold hCG if the ovaries are abnormally enlarged or if abdominal pain occurs.

If ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of follitropin beta treatment, follow current clinical practice to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</p><p>• Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: OHSS is a rare, exaggerated response to ovulation induction therapy (Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). This syndrome may begin within 24 hours of hCG treatment but may become most severe 7 to 10 days after therapy (Corbett 2014). Mild/moderate OHSS signs/symptoms may include abdominal distention/discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and mild/moderate enlargement of ovaries/ovarian cysts. Severe OHSS signs/symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, anuria/oliguria, ascites, severe dyspnea, hypotension, hydrothorax, nausea/vomiting (intractable), pleural effusion, rapid weight gain, venous thrombosis, and large ovarian cysts. Decreased CrCl, hemoconcentration, hypoproteinemia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated WBC, and electrolyte imbalances may also be present (ASRM 2016; Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). Treatment is primarily symptomatic and includes fluid and electrolyte management, analgesics, and prevention of thromboembolic complications (ASRM 2016; Shmorgun 2017).</p><p>• Ovarian torsion: May occur in relation to OHSS, pregnancy, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovaries, previous abdominal surgery, and previous history of ovarian torsion.</p><p>• Pulmonary effects: Serious pulmonary conditions, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, have been reported.</p><p>• Thromboembolic events: In association with and separate from OHSS, thromboembolic events have been reported. Risk may be increased in patients with a personal or family history of thromboembolic events, severe obesity, or thrombophilia.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Multiple dose injection pens: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pen-shaped injection devices should never be used for more than one person (even when the needle is changed) because of the risk of infection. The injection device should be clearly labeled with individual patient information to ensure that the correct pen is used (CDC 2012).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: To minimize risks, use only at the lowest effective dose. Monitor ovarian response with transvaginal ultrasound; concurrent measurement of estradiol levels may also be useful.</p><p>• Experienced physician: These medications should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.</p><p>• Multiple births: May result from the use of these medications; advise patient of the potential risk of multiple births before starting the treatment.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Females: Monitor follicular growth by transvaginal ultrasound to determine adequate ovarian response and timing of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration. Concurrent measurement of estradiol levels may also be useful.</p><p>The clinical evaluation of estrogenic activity (changes in vaginal cytology and changes in appearance and volume of cervical mucus) provides an indirect estimate of the estrogenic effect upon the target organs and, therefore, it should only be used adjunctively with more direct estimates of follicular development (ultrasonography and serum estradiol determinations).</p><p>Monitor for signs and symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) for at least 2 weeks following hCG administration. Initial symptoms of moderate to severe OHSS may include a sensation of bloating, abdominal pain, rapid weight gain, and decreased urine output (Shmorgun 2017).</p><p>OHSS: Monitoring of hospitalized patients should include albumin, degree of ascites, cardiorespiratory status, electrolytes, fluid balance, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, urine output, urine specific gravity, signs of thromboembolism, vital signs, weight (all daily or as necessary), and liver enzymes (weekly) (Shmorgun 2017).</p><p>Males: Monitor for sufficient spermatogenesis. This can be directly estimated by semen analysis, or indirectly estimated by serum testosterone level. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after starting treatment (Puregon Canadian product monograph). Therapy should continue for 3 to 4 months before improvement in spermatogenesis can be expected.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status as well as the fertility of the male partner prior to ovulation induction.</p><p>Evaluate fertility status of the female partner prior to induction of spermatogenesis.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
X

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Ectopic pregnancies, congenital abnormalities, and multiple births have been reported. The incidence of congenital abnormality may be slightly higher after in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection than with spontaneous conception; higher incidence may be related to parenteral characteristics (maternal age, sperm characteristics).</p><p>Follitropin beta is used for the induction of ovulation; use is contraindicated in women who are already pregnant.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to help women get pregnant.</p><p>• It is used to help make sperm.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
