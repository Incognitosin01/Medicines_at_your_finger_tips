The unique delivery system provides a suspension having an acid pH and a low surface tension, exerting a drying effect and allowing the medication to spread quickly to all contiguous surfaces, softening and reducing accumulated cerumen. Chloroxylenol is a halogenated phenol; non-toxic, non-corrosive, non-staining with high phenol coefficient. It may be applied directly to a wound and shows no chemical reactivity toward blood. MyOxin which contains hydrocortisone acetate is indicated when otitis is complicated by inflammation or to control itching. Benzocaine is a topical anesthetic with a low index of sensitization and toxicity.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for MyOxin</h2><p class="First">For the treatment of superficial infections of the external auditory canal complicated by inflammation caused by organisms susceptible to the action of the antimicrobial.

The External auditory canal should be thoroughly cleansed and dried with a sterile cotton applicator.

For infants and small children, 3 drops are suggested because of the smaller capacity of the ear canal.
