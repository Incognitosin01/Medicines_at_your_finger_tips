</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PREVENTS STOMACH ULCERS BY REDUCING ACID PRODUCTION</span></p><p class="First">Stomach ulcers are more common in horses than once believed. Studies have demonstrated stomach ulcers in over 90% of racehorses and 60% of performance horses in various disciplines. Horses secrete acid in their stomach 24 hours a day. Horses on grass pasture or eating large quantities of roughage infrequently develop stomach ulcers. Horses without continual access to roughage or in rigorous training are at greater risk of stomach ulceration due to the effects of acid on the stomach lining. The additional stresses of traveling, competition, stall confinement, and strenuous exercise can also contribute to the development of stomach ulcers in horses.</p><p>UlcerGard works to prevent stomach ulcers in horses. The active ingredient in UlcerGard, omeprazole has been extensively tested for safety and effectiveness. It works by reducing the production of acid in the horse's stomach. To help horses maintain optimal gastric health, it is recommended that UlcerGard be administered during stressful events or activities that may induce stomach ulcers. Such conditions may include: training, racing, showing, traveling, stall confinement, and competition.</p><h2>DIRECTIONS FOR USE</h2><p class="First">Each syringe contains 4 individual daily doses for horses weighing 600-1200 lbs.
