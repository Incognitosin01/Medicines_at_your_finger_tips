Also blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, which results in suppression of high-frequency repetitive neuronal firing (Bourin 2009). Divalproex sodium is a compound of sodium valproate and valproic acid; divalproex dissociates to valproate in the GI tract.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p> Distributes into CSF at concentrations similar to unbound concentration in plasma (ie, ∼10% of total plasma concentration)</p><p>V<sub>d</sub>: Total valproate: 11 L/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; Free valproate 92 L/1.73 m<sup>2</sup></p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Extensively hepatic via glucuronide conjugation (30% to 50% of administered dose) and 40% via mitochondrial beta-oxidation; other oxidative metabolic pathways occur to a lesser extent.</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (30% to 50% as glucuronide conjugate, &lt;3% as unchanged drug); faster clearance in children who receive other antiepileptic drugs and those who are younger; age and polytherapy explain 80% of interpatient variability in total clearance; children &gt;10 years of age have pharmacokinetic parameters similar to adults </p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Oral:</p><p>Divalproex sodium:</p><p>Delayed release: tablet and sprinkle capsules: ~4 hours</p><p>Extended release: 4 to 17 hours</p><p>Immediate release enteric-coated tablet [Canadian product]: 4 hours</p><p>Valproic acid delayed release capsule: 2 hours</p><p>Rectal (off-label route): 1 to 3 hours (Graves 1987)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Increased in neonates, elderly, and patients with liver impairment</p><p>Newborns (exposed to VPA in utero): 30 to 60 hours</p><p>Neonates first week of life: 40 to 45 hours</p><p>Neonates &lt;10 days: 10 to 67 hours </p><p>Infants and Children &gt;2 months: 7 to 13 hours</p><p>Children and Adolescents 2 to 14 years: 9 hours (range: 3.5 to 20 hours) (Cloyd 1993) </p><p>Adults: 9 to 16 hours </p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Concentration dependent: 80% to 90%; free fraction: ~10% at 40 mcg/mL and ~18.5% at 130 mcg/mL; protein binding decreased in neonates, the elderly and patients with hepatic or renal impairment</p><h2>Special Populations: Renal Function Impairment</h2><p>A 27% reduction in clearance of unbound valproate is seen in patients with CrCl &lt;10 mL/minute.

Dosing based on multiple pediatric trials. In one open-label trial of divalproex sodium (DVS) (n=42; age range: 7 to 16 years); dose was initiated at 15 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses and increased as needed over 6 weeks to 45 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses. After 4 months, 78.5% of subjects had a 50% decrease in headaches frequency, 14.2% had a 75% decrease in headache frequency, and 9.5% became headache free (Caruso 2000). In a randomized comparative trial of pediatric patients aged 4 to 15 years, sodium valproate (n=54) was initiated at 10 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses and titrated based on clinical response and tolerability up to a maximum dose of 40 mg/kg/day in divided doses; similar efficacy to propranolol (n=56) was observed with regards to decrease in headache frequency by &gt;50%, mean headache duration, headache severity, and improved response to rescue medications (Ashrafi 2005). A small (n=10) open-label trial of pediatric patients 9 to 17 years showed a statistically significant decrease in mean frequency of headache attacks, severity, and duration with divalproex sodium therapy using a daily dose range of 500 to 1,000 mg/day (Serdaroglu 2002).</p><p>Adolescents ≥17 years: Depakote: Oral: 250 mg twice daily; adjust dose based on patient response; maximum daily dose: 1,000 mg/<b>day</b>.</p><p>Depakote ER: Limited data available: Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Oral: 500 mg once daily for 15 days, may increase to 1,000 mg once daily; adjust dose based on patient response; usual dosage range: 250 to 1,000 mg/day; dose should be individualized; if smaller dosage adjustments are needed, use Depakote delayed-release tablets; results from a Phase 3, long-term (12 months) open-label trial of 241 patients (age: 12 to 17 years) showed a 75% decrease in median 4-week headache days between the first and fourth months of the trial (Apostol 2009a). In a short-term (12 weeks), double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of 304 patients (age: 12 to 17 years), Depakote ER (250 to 1,000 mg/day) was no different than placebo at reducing the 4-week headache rate; however, a large placebo effect was observed in the study population (Apostol 2008).</p><p><b>Migraine, treatment; refractory:</b> Limited data available, efficacy results variable, optimal regimen not established:</p><p>Intermittent IV: Adolescents 500 or 1,000 mg infused at 50 mg/minute; a repeat dose of 500 mg may be administered if pain relief not observed (Reiter 2005; Sheridan 2015); dosing based on two retrospective reports that evaluated experience in 43 patients treated for acute migraine attack(s) (n=60; some subjects presented with multiple attacks); the mean age in both reports was 15 years and the majority of patients received 1,000 mg doses. One trial evaluated 48 clinic visits for acute migraine attack in 31 patients; adequate pain relief was reported in 77.6% of visits (n=45) after a single valproic acid dose; the mean time to achieve maximum pain relief was 63 ± 31 minutes (range: 15 to 160 minutes) after a single dose of valproic acid; maximum pain reduction following a repeat 500 mg dose was observed at 124 ± 62 minutes (range: 20 to 250 minutes) (Reiter 2005).</p><p>Continuous IV infusion: Children ≥4 years and Adolescents:</p><p><i>Loading dose:</i> IV: 20 mg/kg; maximum dose: 2,000 mg/dose infused over 30 to 60 minutes.</p><p><i>Continuous infusion: </i>IV: Initial: 1 mg/kg/<b>hour</b>; adjust to maintain target serum concentrations of 80 to 100 mcg/mL (assessed at 2 to 4 hours and at 24 hours after loading dose) (Cook 2016; Taylor 2007; Zafar 2018).

These incidents usually have occurred during the first 6 months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first 6 months.</p><p>Children &lt;2 years of age are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple anticonvulsants, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease. When these products are used in this patient group, they should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.</p><p>There is an increased risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) gene (eg, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome). Valproate is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children younger than 2 years who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder. In patients &gt;2 years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, only use after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with valproate for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing. POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice.</p><p>Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (eg, spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure. Valproate is therefore contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in pregnant women and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such situations, effective contraception should be used.</p><p>A Medication Guide describing the risks of valproate is available for patients.</p><p>Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Blood disorders: May cause dose-related thrombocytopenia, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and bleeding. In some cases, platelet counts may be normalized with continued treatment; however, reduce dose or discontinue drug if patient develops evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation. Evaluate platelet counts prior to initiating therapy and periodically thereafter. Probability of thrombocytopenia increases with total valproate levels ≥110 mcg/mL in females or ≥135 mcg/mL in males. In addition to platelets, valproate may be associated with a decrease in other cell lines and myelodysplasia.</p><p>• Brain atrophy: Reversible and irreversible cerebral and cerebellar atrophy have been reported; motor and cognitive function should be routinely monitored to assess for signs and symptoms of brain atrophy.</p><p>• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).</p><p>• Hepatic failure: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients, usually in the initial 6 months of therapy; children &lt;2 years of age are at considerable risk. Risk is also increased in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) gene (eg, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome [AHS]). </b> Other risk factors include organic brain disease, mental retardation with severe seizure disorders, congenital metabolic disorders, and patients on multiple anticonvulsants. Monitor patients closely for appearance of malaise, weakness, facial edema, anorexia, jaundice, and vomiting; discontinue immediately with signs/symptom of significant or suspected impairment. Liver function tests should be performed at baseline and at regular intervals after initiation of therapy, especially within the first 6 months. Hepatic dysfunction may progress despite discontinuing treatment. Should only be used as monotherapy and with extreme caution in children &lt;2 years of age and/or patients at high risk for hepatotoxicity.</p><p>• Hyperammonemia/encephalopathy: Hyperammonemia and/or encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following the initiation of valproate therapy and may be present with normal transaminase levels. Ammonia levels should be measured in patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting, or changes in mental status or in patients who present with hypothermia. Discontinue therapy if ammonia levels are increased and evaluate for possible urea cycle disorder (UCD). Hyperammonemic encephalopathy has been reported in patients with UCD, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Use is contraindicated in patients with known UCD. Evaluation of UCD should be considered for the following patients prior to the start of therapy: History of unexplained encephalopathy or coma; encephalopathy associated with protein load; pregnancy or postpartum encephalopathy; unexplained mental retardation; history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; history of cyclical vomiting and lethargy; episodic extreme irritability, ataxia; low BUN or protein avoidance; family history of UCD or unexplained infant deaths (particularly male); or signs or symptoms of UCD (hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, respiratory alkalosis). Hyperammonemia and/or encephalopathy may also occur with concomitant topiramate therapy in patients who previously tolerated monotherapy with either medication.</p><p>• Hypothermia: Hypothermia (unintentional drop in core body temperature to &lt;35°C/95°F) has been reported with valproate therapy; hypothermia may or may not be associated with hyperammonemia; may also occur with concomitant topiramate therapy following topiramate initiation or dosage increase.</p><p>• Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]): Potentially serious, sometimes fatal multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions have rarely been reported with some antiepileptic drugs including valproate therapy in adults and children; monitor for signs and symptoms of possible disparate manifestations associated with lymphatic, hepatic, renal, and/or hematologic organ systems; discontinuation and conversion to alternate therapy may be required.</p><p>• Pancreatitis: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis, occurring at the start of therapy or following years of use, have been reported in adults and children.</b> Some cases have been hemorrhagic with rapid progression of initial symptoms to death. Promptly evaluate symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia; should generally be discontinued if pancreatitis is diagnosed.</p><p>• Suicidal ideation: Pooled analysis of trials involving various antiepileptics (regardless of indication) showed an increased risk of suicidal thoughts/behavior (incidence rate: 0.43% treated patients compared to 0.24% of patients receiving placebo); risk observed as early as 1 week after initiation and continued through duration of trials (most trials ≤24 weeks). Monitor all patients for notable changes in behavior that might indicate suicidal thoughts or depression; notify healthcare provider immediately if symptoms occur.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute head trauma: Not recommended for post-traumatic seizure prophylaxis in patients with acute head trauma; study results for this indication suggested increased mortality with IV valproate sodium use compared to IV phenytoin.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Contraindicated with significant impairment.</p><p>• Mitochondrial disease: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and death is increased in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial polymerase gamma (POLG) gene (eg, Alpers Huttenlocher syndrome [AHS]). Use is contraindicated in patients with known mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children &lt;2 years of age suspected of having a POLG-related disorder. Use in children ≥2 years of age suspected of having a POLG-related disorder only after other anticonvulsants have failed and with close monitoring for the development of acute liver injury.</b> POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution as elderly patients may be more sensitive to sedating effects and dehydration; in some elderly patients with somnolence, concomitant decreases in nutritional intake and weight loss were observed. Reduce initial dosages in elderly and closely monitor fluid status, nutritional intake, somnolence, and other adverse events.</p><p>• Pediatric: Children &lt;2 years of age are at increased risk for fatal hepatotoxicity; if valproate therapy is used in this age group, use with extreme caution and only as monotherapy.</p><p>• Pregnancy: <b>[US Boxed Warning]:</b> <b>Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (eg, spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure. Valproate is contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in pregnant women and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such situations, effective contraception should be used.</b></p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Gastrointestinal: Medication residue in stool has been reported (rarely) with oral divalproex sodium formulations; some reports have occurred in patients with shortened GI transit times (eg, diarrhea) or anatomic GI disorders (eg, ileostomy, colostomy). In patients reporting medication residue in stool, it is recommended to monitor valproate level and clinical condition.</p><p>• Viral replication: In vitro studies have suggested valproate stimulates the replication of HIV and CMV viruses under experimental conditions. The clinical consequence of this is unknown, but should be considered when monitoring affected patients.</p><p>• Withdrawal: Anticonvulsants should not be discontinued abruptly because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency; therapy should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency, unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Liver enzymes (at baseline and frequently during therapy especially during the first 6 months), CBC with platelets (baseline and periodic intervals), PT/PTT (especially prior to surgery), serum ammonia (with symptoms of lethargy, mental status change), serum valproate levels; suicidality (eg, suicidal thoughts, depression, behavioral changes); motor and cognitive function (for signs or symptoms of brain atrophy); menstrual history to assess for polycystic ovary syndrome (at 3 to 6 month intervals for the first year, then annually) (CANMAT [Yatham 2018]).</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: Due to the risks of adverse fetal events, valproate is contraindicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such situations, effective contraception should be used.</b></p><p>Algorithms are available for the management of females of reproductive potential who are taking valproic acid for bipolar disorder. Non-pregnant women who are stable on mono-therapy and are planning a pregnancy should undergo a slow taper (&gt;4 weeks); alternative treatment and a faster taper should be introduced in unstable patients during this time. Additional details are available for women planning a pregnancy who are on multiple medications (Anmella 2019).</p><p>When pregnancy is being planned in women with epilepsy, consider tapering off of therapy prior to conception if appropriate (Anmella 2019; Harden 2009a); abrupt discontinuation of therapy may cause status epilepticus and lead to maternal and fetal hypoxia.</p><p>Counsel women planning a pregnancy and girls at the onset of puberty regarding benefits and risk of valproate use during pregnancy. Folic acid decreases the risk of neural tube defects in the general population; supplementation with folic acid should be used prior to conception and during pregnancy in all females, including those taking valproate.</p><p>Cases of male infertility have been reported following valproate use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Valproate crosses the placenta (Harden 2009b).</p><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (eg, spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure. </b>Neural tube defects, craniofacial defects (eg, oral clefts, craniosynostosis), cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, and limb malformations (eg, clubfoot, polydactyly) have been reported. Information from the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry notes the rate of major malformations to be 9% to 11% following an average exposure to valproate monotherapy 1,000 mg/day; this is an increase in congenital malformations when compared with monotherapy with other antiepileptic drugs (AED). Based on data from the CDC National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spinal bifida is approximately 1% to 2% following valproate exposure (general population risk estimated to be 0.06% to 0.07%).</p><p>Nonteratogenic adverse effects have also been reported. Decreased IQ scores have been noted in children exposed to valproate in utero when compared to children exposed to other antiepileptic medications or no antiepileptic medications; the risk of autism spectrum disorders may also be increased. Hearing loss or impairment may occur following in utero exposure. Fatal hepatic failure and hypoglycemia in infants have been noted in case reports following in utero exposure to valproate.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of valproate in pregnancy are highly variable. If use is needed, monitoring of total and unbound serum concentrations should be done prior to and during pregnancy (Johannessen 2018). Clotting factor abnormalities (hypofibrinogenemia, thrombocytopenia, or decrease in other coagulation factors) may develop in the mother following valproate use during pregnancy; close monitoring of coagulation factors is recommended.</p><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]:</b>Due to the risks of adverse fetal events, <b>valproate is contraindicated for prophylaxisof migraine headaches in pregnant women. Valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. </b>Current guidelines recommend complete avoidance of valproate for the treatment of epilepsy in pregnant women whenever possible (Harden 2009a).</p><p>A pregnancy registry is available for women who have been exposed to valproic acid.
