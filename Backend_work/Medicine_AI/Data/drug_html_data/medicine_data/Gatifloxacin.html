DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) is an essential bacterial enzyme that maintains the superhelical structure of DNA. DNA gyrase is required for DNA replication and transcription, DNA repair, recombination, and transposition; inhibition is bactericidal.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Ophthalmic: Not measurable (&lt;5 ng/mL)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Conjunctivitis:</b> Treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, <i>Streptococcus mitis</i> group, <i>Streptococcus oralis</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Bacterial keratitis</h3><p>Data from a limited number of patients in two small randomized trials support the use of gatifloxacin in the treatment of bacterial keratitis <sup>[Parmar 2006]</sup>, <sup>[Shah 2010]</sup>. Additional data may be necessary to further define the role of gatifloxacin for this condition.</p><p>Based on the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern Guidelines for Bacterial Keratitis, gatifloxacin is an effective and recommended agent in the management of bacterial keratitis.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to gatifloxacin, other quinolones, or any component of the formulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Bacterial conjunctivitis:</b> Ophthalmic:</p><p><i>Zymar [Canadian product]:</i></p><p>Days 1 and 2: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) every 2 hours while awake (maximum: 8 times/day).</p><p>Days 3 to 7: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) 4 times/day while awake.</p><p><i>Zymaxid:</i></p><p>Day 1: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) every 2 hours while awake (maximum: 8 times/day).</p><p>Days 2 to 7: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) 2 to 4 times/day while awake.</p><p><b>Bacterial keratitis (off-label use): </b> Ophthalmic: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) every 1 hour around the clock until healing begins (usually 48 to 72 hours); dosing frequency is then gradually reduced until the ulcer is completely healed, at which point, treatment can be discontinued (Parmar 2006; Shah 2010). One suggested tapering regimen is as follows: Days 3 to 6: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) every 2 hours around the clock; Days 7 to 9: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) every 2 hours while awake; Day 9 and on: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) every 6 hours and continue at this frequency until complete healing of ulcer (Shah 2010). <b>Note:</b> For central or severe keratitis, a loading dose of instillation every 5 to 15 minutes for the first 30 to 60 minutes may be considered (AAO 2013).</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Bacterial conjunctivitis:</b> Ophthalmic: Children ≥1 year and Adolescents: Zymaxid: Day 1: Instill 1 drop into affected eye(s) every 2 hours while awake (maximum: 8 times/day).

Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were also reported. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue use.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection. If superinfection is suspected, institute appropriate alternative therapy.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Contact lens wearers: Contact lenses should not be worn during treatment of ophthalmic infections.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For topical ophthalmic use only. Do not inject ophthalmic solution subconjunctivally or introduce directly into the anterior chamber of the eye (may cause corneal endothelial cell injury).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Systemic concentrations of gatifloxacin following ophthalmic administration are below the limit of quantification. If ophthalmic agents are needed during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be used in combination with punctal occlusion for 3 to 5 minutes after application to decrease potential exposure to the fetus (Samples 1988).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat eye infections.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
