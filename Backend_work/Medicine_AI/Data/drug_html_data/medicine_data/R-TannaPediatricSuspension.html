Appropriate therapy should be provided for the primary disease.<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">R-Tanna Pediatric Suspension is contraindicated for newborns, nursing mothers and patients sensitive to any of the ingredients or related compounds.<br/></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Use with caution in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, narrow angle glaucoma or prostatic, hypertrophy. Use with caution or avoid use in patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.

Antihistamines may cause excitation, particularly in children, but their combination with sympathomimetics may cause either mild stimulation or mild sedation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Information for patients:</span> Caution patients against drinking alcoholic beverages or engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring alertness, such as driving a car or operating machinery while using this product. Patients should be warned not to use this product if they are now taking a prescription monamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (certain drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson's disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug. If patients are uncertain whether a prescription drug contains an MAOI, they should be instructed to consult a health professional before taking such a product.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug interactions:</span> MAO inhibitors may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines and the overall effects of sympathomimetic agents.</p><p>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility: No long term animal studies have been performed with R-Tanna Pediatric Suspension.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy:</span> Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C.
