</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Vaccine</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Menactra</h2><p>Meningococcal vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection by certain groups of meningococcal bacteria. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.</p><p><i>Menomune®</i> is active against groups A, C, Y and W-135 meningococcal bacteria only.</p><p><i>Bexsero®</i> and <i>Trumenba®</i> is active against group B meningococcal bacteria only. .</p><p>Meningococcal infection can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningococcal meningitis, which affects the brain, and meningococcemia, which affects the blood. Some persons with meningococcal meningitis and/or meningococcemia also may die. These diseases are more likely to occur in young children and in persons with certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.</p><p>Immunization against meningococcal disease is recommended for persons who are at risk of getting the disease because:</p><ul>
<li>They have certain diseases or conditions that make them more susceptible to a meningococcal infection or more likely to develop serious problems from a meningococcal infection.</li>
<li>They are living in, working in, or visiting an area where there is a strong possibility of contracting meningococcal disease.</li>
