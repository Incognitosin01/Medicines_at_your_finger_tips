This results in the accumulation of cleavable complexes and double-strand DNA breaks. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these breaks, cell death consistent with S-phase cell cycle specificity occurs, leading to termination of cellular replication.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Children and Adolescents: ~37 L/m<sup>2</sup> (range: 15.2 to 77 L/m<sup>2</sup>) (Ma 2000); distributes to pleural fluid, sweat, and saliva</p><p>Adults: 33 to 150 L/m<sup>2</sup></p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Primarily hepatic to SN-38 (active metabolite) by carboxylesterase enzymes; may also undergo CYP3A4-mediated metabolism to inactive metabolites (one of which may be hydrolyzed to release SN-38). SN-38 undergoes conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) to form a glucuronide metabolite. SN-38 is increased by UGT1A1*28 polymorphism (10% of North Americans are homozygous for UGT1A1*28 allele). </p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine: Irinotecan (11% to 20%), metabolites (SN-38 &lt;1%, SN-38 glucuronide, 3%) </p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Irinotecan: Oral: Children and Adolescents: 3 hours (Wagner 2010a) </p><p>SN-38: Following 90-minute infusion: ~1 hour</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Children and Adolescents (Ma 2000): Irinotecan: 2.66 hours (range: 1.82 to 4.47 hours); SN-38 (active metabolite): 1.58 hours (range: 0.29 to 8.28 hours)</p><p>Adults: Irinotecan: 6 to 12 hours; SN-38: ~10 to 20 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Plasma: Predominantly albumin; Irinotecan: 30% to 68%, SN-38 (active metabolite): ~95%</p><h2>Special Populations: Hepatic Function Impairment</h2><p>Cl of irinotecan is decreased and exposure to the active metabolite (SN-38) is increased proportional to the degree of hepatic impairment.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Colorectal cancer, metastatic:</b> Treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, either as first-line therapy (in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin), or for recurrent disease following initial fluorouracil-based treatment.</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Cervical cancer (recurrent or metastatic)</h3><p>Data from a small phase II study support the use of irinotecan in the treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer <sup>[Verschraegen 1997]</sup>.</p><h3>CNS tumor, (recurrent glioblastoma)</h3><p>Data from two phase II trials support the use of irinotecan (in combination with bevacizumab) in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma <sup>[Friedman 2009]</sup>, <sup>[Vredenburgh 2007]</sup>.</p><h3>Esophageal cancer (metastatic or locally advanced)</h3><p>Data from a phase III randomized trial support the use of irinotecan, in combination with leucovorin and fluorouracil, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction <sup>[Guimbaud 2014]</sup>.

manage regimen-related toxicities in the same manner as for nonobese patients; if a dose reduction is utilized due to toxicity, consider resumption of full weight-based dosing with subsequent cycles, especially if cause of toxicity (eg, hepatic or renal impairment) is resolved (Griggs 2012).</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Dilute in  D<sub>5</sub>W  (preferred) or NS to a final concentration of 0.12 to 2.8 mg/mL. </p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Administer by IV infusion, usually over 90 minutes.</p><p>Premedications: Irinotecan is associated with a moderate emetic potential (Dupuis 2011; Hesketh 2017; Roila 2016); premedication with dexamethasone and a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> blocker is recommended 30 minutes prior to administration; prochlorperazine may be considered for subsequent use (if needed). Consider atropine 0.25 to 1 mg IV or SubQ as premedication for or treatment of cholinergic symptoms (eg, increased salivation, rhinitis, miosis, diaphoresis, abdominal cramping) or early onset diarrhea.</p><p>Diarrhea management: The recommended regimen to manage late diarrhea is loperamide 4 mg orally at onset of late diarrhea, followed by 2 mg every 2 hours (or 4 mg every 4 hours at night) until 12 hours have passed without a bowel movement. If diarrhea recurs, then repeat administration.

Complications due to neutropenia should be promptly managed with antibiotics. Therapy should be temporarily withheld if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count is &lt;1,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; reduce the dose upon recovery to an absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal radiation therapy have an increased risk of severe bone marrow suppression; the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was higher in patients receiving weekly irinotecan who have previously received pelvic/abdominal radiation therapy. Concurrent radiation therapy is not recommended with irinotecan (based on limited data).</p><p>• Diarrhea:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Severe diarrhea may be dose-limiting and potentially fatal; early-onset and late-onset diarrhea may occur. Early diarrhea occurs during or within 24 hours of receiving irinotecan and is characterized by cholinergic symptoms; may be prevented or treated with atropine. Late diarrhea may be life-threatening and should be promptly treated with loperamide. Antibiotics may be necessary if patient develops ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. Interrupt treatment and reduce subsequent doses for severe diarrhea.</b> Early diarrhea is generally transient and rarely severe; cholinergic symptoms may include increased salivation, rhinitis, miosis, diaphoresis, flushing, abdominal cramping, and lacrimation; bradycardia may also occur. Cholinergic symptoms may occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Late diarrhea occurs more than 24 hours after treatment, which may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Late diarrhea may be complicated by colitis, ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, or infection; cases of megacolon and intestinal perforation have been reported. The median time to onset for late diarrhea is 5 days with every 3 week irinotecan dosing and 11 days with weekly dosing. Advise patients to have loperamide readily available for the treatment of late diarrhea. Patients with diarrhea should be carefully monitored and treated promptly; may require fluid and electrolyte therapy. Bowel function should be returned to baseline for at least 24 hours prior to resumption of weekly irinotecan dosing. Avoid diuretics and laxatives in patients experiencing diarrhea.</p><p>• Extravasation: Irinotecan is an irritant. Avoid extravasation; if extravasation occurs, the manufacturer recommends flushing the external site with sterile water and applying ice.</p><p>• Gastrointestinal toxicity: Irinotecan is associated with a moderate emetic potential; antiemetics are recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting (Dupuis 2011; Hesketh 2017; Roila 2016).</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) have occurred.

Risk factors for pulmonary toxicity include preexisting lung disease, use of pulmonary toxic medications, radiation therapy, and colony-stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during irinotecan treatment. Promptly evaluate progressive changes in baseline pulmonary symptoms or any new-onset pulmonary symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever). Discontinue all chemotherapy if IPD is diagnosed.</p><p>• Renal toxicity: Renal impairment and acute renal failure have been reported, possibly due to dehydration secondary to diarrhea. Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; not recommended in patients on dialysis.</p><p>• Thromboembolism: Thromboembolic events have been reported.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Bowel obstruction: Patients with bowel obstruction should not be treated with irinotecan until resolution of obstruction.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; exposure to the active metabolite (SN-38) is increased; toxicities may be increased. Patients with even modest elevations in total serum bilirubin levels (1 to 2 mg/dL) have a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-course grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were &lt;1 mg/dL. Patients with abnormal glucuronidation of bilirubin, such as those with Gilbert syndrome, may also be at greater risk of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with irinotecan. Use caution when treating patients with known hepatic dysfunction or hyperbilirubinemia; dosage adjustments should be considered.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Drug-drug interactions: CYP3A4 enzyme inducers may decrease exposure to irinotecan and SN-38 (active metabolite); enzyme inhibitors may increase exposure. For use in patients with CNS tumors (off-label use), selection of antiseizure medications that are not enzyme inducers is preferred.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Patients &gt;65 years of age are at greater risk for early and late diarrhea. A dose reduction is recommended for patients ≥70 years of age receiving the every-3-week regimen.</p><p>• Patients homozygous/heterozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele: Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk of neutropenia; consider reducing the initial dose by at least one dose level for both single-agent and combination regimens. Heterozygous carriers of the UGT1A1*28 allele may also be at increased neutropenic risk; however, most patients have tolerated normal starting doses. A test is available for clinical determination of UGT phenotype, although a dose reduction is already recommended in patients who have experienced toxicity.</p><p>• Pelvic/abdominal radiation recipients: Use with caution in patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal radiation; may increase risk of severe myelosuppression.</p><p>• Performance status: Higher rates of hospitalization, neutropenic fever, thromboembolism, first-cycle discontinuation, and early mortality were observed in patients with a performance status of 2 than in patients with a performance status of 0 or 1.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Conventional vs liposomal formulation dosing: Irinotecan (conventional) and irinotecan (liposomal) are <b>NOT</b> interchangeable. Dosing differs between formulations; verify intended product and dose prior to preparation and administration.</p><p>• Sorbitol: Product contains sorbitol; do not use in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Except as part of a clinical trial, use in combination with the fluorouracil and leucovorin administered for 4 or 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks (“Mayo Clinic” regimen) is not recommended due to increased toxicity.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential, platelet count, and hemoglobin with each dose; bilirubin, electrolytes (with severe diarrhea); monitor for cholinergic reactions; monitor bowel movements and hydration status; signs/symptoms of pulmonary toxicity or hypersensitivity reactions; monitor infusion site for signs of inflammation and avoid extravasation. Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential.</p><p>A test is available for genotyping of UGT1A1; however, use of the test is not widely accepted and a dose reduction is already recommended in patients who have experienced toxicity.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential. Females of reproductive potential should use highly effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after the last irinotecan dose. Males with female partners of reproductive potential should use condoms during therapy and for 3 months after the last dose of irinotecan.</p><p>Menstrual cycle changes and impairment of female fertility may occur with irinotecan therapy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on the mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to irinotecan may cause fetal harm.</p><p>Information related to the use of irinotecan (conventional) during pregnancy is limited (Cirillo 2012; Taylor 2009).</p><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential.
