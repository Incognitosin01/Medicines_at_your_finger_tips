Simvastatin and niacin may help prevent medical problems caused by clogged blood vessels, such as heart attacks and strokes.</p><p>Simvastatin and niacin work together to treat cholesterol and lipid (fat) disorders. Niacin is vitamin B3, which reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood. Simvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called HMG-CoA inhibitors or statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme that is needed to make cholesterol.</p><p>Simvastatin and niacin was available only with your doctor's prescription. The Simcor(R) product will no longer be marketed in the United States as of April 18, 2016.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using simvastatin and niacin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For simvastatin and niacin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to simvastatin and niacin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of simvastatin and niacin combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of simvastatin and niacin combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have muscle problems, which may require caution in patients receiving simvastatin and niacin.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using simvastatin and niacin.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking simvastatin and niacin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of simvastatin and niacin</h2><p><i>Take simvastatin and niacin only as directed by your doctor</i>.

The 80 mg dose of simvastatin may increase your risk to have serious muscle problems.</p><p><i>If you are taking amiodarone (Cordarone®), amlodipine (Norvasc®), or ranolazine (Ranexa®) together with niacin/simvastatin, your niacin/simvastatin dose should not exceed 1000 mg/20 mg per day, unless directed otherwise by your doctor</i>.
