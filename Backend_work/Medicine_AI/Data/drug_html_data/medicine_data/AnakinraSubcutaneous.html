Anakinra is also used to treat a rare genetic disorder called neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). NOMID is the most severe form of a condition called cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS).</p><p>Anakinra is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using anakinra</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For anakinra, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to anakinra or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Use of anakinra injection is not recommended in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of anakinra injection in the elderly. However, anakinra may cause serious infections and kidney problems more often in the elderly, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving anakinra injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using anakinra with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.
