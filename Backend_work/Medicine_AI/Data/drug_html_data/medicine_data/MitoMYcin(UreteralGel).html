Mitomycin is not cell cycle specific but has its maximum effect against cells in late G and early S phases (Perry 2012). Following instillation into the pyelocalyceal system, mitomycin (ureteral gel) forms a semisolid gel that dissolves from normal kidney urine flow, releasing mitomycin.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Following a 60 mg instillation into the pyelocalyceal system, the mean C<sub>max</sub> mitomycin plasma concentration was estimated to be &lt;1% of the expected C<sub>max</sub> following IV administration.</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (primarily); following instillation into the pyelocalyceal system, mitomycin (ureteral gel) forms a semisolid gel that dissolves from normal kidney urine flow (releasing mitomycin) for up to 4 to 6 hours; mitomycin is eliminated unchanged in the urine. ~10% of systemically absorbed mitomycin is excreted unchanged in the urine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Urothelial cancer, low-grade upper tract</b><b>:</b> Treatment of low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer in adults.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Perforation of the bladder or upper urinary tract.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Do <b>NOT</b> substitute mitomycin (ureteral gel) for mitomycin injection or mitomycin (ophthalmic) or vice versa; the products are different and are <b>NOT </b>interchangeable. Mitomycin (ureteral gel) is not for intravesicular use, refer to the Mitomycin (systemic) monograph for information on intravesicular use (off-label route) of mitomycin for injection.</p><p><i>Prior to instillation: </i>Premedicate prior to each instillation with a total of 3.9 g sodium bicarbonate (1.3 g orally the evening prior to, 1.3 g the morning of, and 1.3 g 30 minutes prior to the instillation). Local or general anesthesia, sedation, prophylactic antibiotics, and/or antihistamines may be used as clinically necessary. If anesthesia is to be used, do not administer the final sodium bicarbonate dose. Consider withholding diuretics 1 day prior to instillation until 4 hours post instillation.</p><p><b>Urothelial cancer, low-grade upper tract: </b>Pyelocalyceal instillation: Instill mitomycin (ureteral gel) dose once weekly for 6 weeks via ureteral catheter or nephrostomy tube. In patients with a complete response 3 months after therapy initiation, may then administer mitomycin (ureteral gel) once monthly for a maximum of 11 additional instillations.</p><p>Total instillation volume is based on volumetric measurements using pyelography, and should not exceed 15 mL (60 mg of mitomycin). The concentration of reconstituted mitomycin (ureteral gel) is 4 mg/mL.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Adjustment for Toxicity</h2><p>Hematologic toxicity:</p><p>Neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, grade 2: Withhold mitomycin (ureteral gel).</p><p>Neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, ≥grade 3: Permanently discontinue mitomycin (ureteral gel).</p><p>Ureteric obstruction: Withhold or permanently discontinue mitomycin (ureteral gel) based on the severity of the obstruction.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p><b>Note: </b>Do <b>NOT</b> substitute mitomycin (ureteral gel) for mitomycin injection or mitomycin (ophthalmic) or vice versa; the products are different and are <b>NOT</b> interchangeable.</p><p>Reconstituted mitomycin (ureteral gel) must be prepared under chilled conditions using a UroGen Pharma Chilling Block. All components must be kept cold during preparation by placing them in the Chilling Block when not in use. If difficulty pushing or withdrawing the solution occurs, place the components back in the Chilling Block until the product liquifies. Reconstituted mitomycin (ureteral gel) has a mitomycin concentration of 4 mg/mL and will appear as a viscous liquid. Reconstituted mitomycin (ureteral gel) has reverse thermal properties with a gelation point of ~19°C (~66°F). Refer to product labeling for further information regarding preparation.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Refer to manufacturer's labeling for administration details. Mitomycin (ureteral gel) is for pyelocalyceal instillation only (via ureteral catheter or nephrostomy tube). Do not administer IV, topically, or orally. When instilling mitomycin (ureteral gel), the entire syringe must be emptied within 1 minute. Reconstituted mitomycin (ureteral gel) must be instilled within 1 hour after it is converted to a viscous liquid.</p><p>Premedicate with oral sodium bicarbonate prior to each instillation (refer to Dosing for details). Mitomycin (ureteral gel) may discolor urine to a violet to blue color following instillation. Patients should avoid contact with urine for at least 6 hours post-instillation, void urine sitting on a toilet, and flush the toilet several times after use.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Mitomycin (ureteral gel) is not for intravesicular use, refer to the Mitomycin (systemic) monograph for information on off-label intravesicular use of mitomycin for injection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store carton at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). Avoid excessive heat &gt;40°C (104°F). If not instilled immediately, reconstituted product is stable at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) for up to 8 hours (will appear as a semisolid gel). Once chilled at -3°C to 5°C (27°F to 41°F), mitomycin (ureteral gel) will convert to a viscous liquid and is stable for up to 1 additional hour.

In a clinical study, gross extravasation of mitomycin (ureteral gel) through urinary tract perforation or impaired mucosa was not observed in patients experiencing bone marrow suppression. Monitor blood counts prior to each instillation (platelet count, WBC count with differential, and hemoglobin); withhold for grade 2 and permanently discontinue for grade 3 or greater neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.</p><p>• Ureteric obstruction: Ureteric obstruction has been reported with mitomycin (ureteral gel), including ureteral stenosis and hydronephrosis. In a small clinical trial, ureteric obstruction was observed in close to 60% of patients; grade 3 obstruction was noted in some patients. The median time to first onset of ureteric obstruction was 72 days (range: 15 to 462 days). Ureteral stent placement, balloon dilation, or nephroureterectomy were required in some patients; in those who required ureteral stent placement, the median duration of indwelling stents was 51 days (range: 1 to 292 days). Ureteric obstruction did not resolve (or resolved with sequelae) in ~50% of patients; some patients experienced grade 1 or 2 serum creatinine increases. Monitor for signs/symptoms of ureteric obstruction, including flank pain and fever, and for changes in renal function. Withhold or permanently discontinue mitomycin (ureteral gel) based on the severity of ureteral obstruction.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Product selection: Mitomycin is available as mitomycin (ureteral gel), mitomycin for injection, and mitomycin (ophthalmic); the products are different and are <b>NOT</b> interchangeable. Verify product label prior to reconstitution and administration to prevent medication errors. Mitomycin (ureteral gel) is not for intravesicular use; refer to the Mitomycin (systemic) monograph for information on intravesicular use (off-label route) of mitomycin for injection.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor blood counts (WBC count with differential, platelet count, hemoglobin) prior to each instillation; serum creatinine.
