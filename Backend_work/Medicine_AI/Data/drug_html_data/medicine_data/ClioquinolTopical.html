</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for clioquinol</h2><p>Clioquinol belongs to the family of medicines called anti-infectives. Clioquinol topical preparations are used to treat skin infections.</p><p>Clioquinol is available without a prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using clioquinol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For clioquinol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to clioquinol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Clioquinol is not recommended in children younger than 2 years of age. Although there is no specific information comparing use of clioquinol in children 2 years of age and older with use in other age groups, clioquinol is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of clioquinol in the elderly with use in other age groups, clioquinol is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of clioquinol. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

<li>Liver disease—Caution is advised with clioquinol use in patients with liver or kidney disease</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of clioquinol</h2><p>Before applying clioquinol, wash the affected area with soap and water, and dry thoroughly.</p><p>Do not use clioquinol in or around the eyes. If accidental contact occurs, flush eyes with water.</p><p>Do not bandage or apply an occlusive dressing (airtight covering, such as kitchen plastic wrap) over clioquinol, since it may increase the infection and may cause unwanted drug absorption into the body. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>To use the ointment form of clioquinol:</p><ul>
<li>Apply a thin layer of ointment to the affected area and rub in gently. The ointment is recommended for use on dry, crusted lesions.</li>

Do not miss any doses.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of clioquinol will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of clioquinol. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
