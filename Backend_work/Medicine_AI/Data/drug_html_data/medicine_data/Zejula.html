This includes ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer (the peritoneum is the membrane that lines the inside of your abdomen and covers some of your internal organs).</p><p>Zejula is given after you have received platinum-based chemotherapy (with cisplatin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, or similar) and your cancer has responded to that medicine.</p><p>Zejula is sometimes used only if your cancer has a specific genetic marker (an abnormal "BRCA" gene) or other gene mutations. Your doctor will test you for this gene to determine if Zejula is right for you.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Stop taking Zejula and call your doctor at once if you have fever, frequent infections, weakness, tiredness, shortness of breath, weight loss, blood in your urine or stools, easy bruising or bleeding.
