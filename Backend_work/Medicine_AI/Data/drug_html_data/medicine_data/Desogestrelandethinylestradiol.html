It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, and when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than birth control pills. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.</p><p>Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol does not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.</p><p>Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol or any other medicines.

However, pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of this medication in teenagers are not expected. Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol may be used for birth control in teenage females but should not be used before the start of menstruation.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol combination have not been performed in the geriatric population. Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol is not indicated for use in elderly women.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.
