It helps your body produce a substance that dissolves unwanted blood clots.</p><p>Alteplase is used to treat a stroke caused by a blood clot or other obstruction in a blood vessel. Alteplase is also used to prevent death from a heart attack (acute myocardial infarction).</p><p>Alteplase is also used to treat a blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism).</p><p>Alteplase is also used to dissolve blood clots that have formed in or around a catheter placed inside a blood vessel. This improve the flow of medicines injected in through the catheter, or blood drawn out through the catheter.</p><p>Alteplase may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Alteplase increases your risk of severe or fatal bleeding,</b> especially from a surgical incision, or from the skin where a needle was inserted. <b>Seek emergency help if you have any bleeding that will not stop.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with alteplase if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>

A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Alteplase is usually given within 3 hours after the first signs of stroke or heart attack symptoms. Your breathing, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs will be watched closely.</p><p>You will also be watched closely for several hours after receiving alteplase, to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction to the medication.</p><p>When used to clear blood clots from a catheter, alteplase is given in 1 or 2 doses.</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe a blood thinner or other medication to help prevent future blood clots. Carefully follow all dosing instructions. These medications can make it easier for you to bleed, even from a minor injury.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive alteplase in a clinical setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving alteplase?</h2><p><b>Ask your doctor before taking aspirin or ibuprofen</b> (Motrin, Advil) shortly after you have received alteplase.
