Should a sensitivity reaction occur, discontinue use. Ophthalmic ointments may retard corneal wound healing. Neomycin Sulfate may cause cutaneous sensitization. Remove contact lenses before using.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be initiated. Whenever clinical judgment dictates; the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, corneal staining.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">This product is sterile when packaged. To prevent contamination, care should be taken to avoid touching the tube tip to eyelids or to any other surface. The use of this tube by more than one person may spread infection. Keep tube tightly closed when not in use. Keep out of the reach of children.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential have not been conducted with Polymyxin B Sulfate. Treatment of cultured human lymphocytes <span class="Italics">in-vitro</span> with neomycin increased the frequency of chromosome aberrations at the highest concentrations (80 µg/mL) tested; however, the effects of neomycin on carcinogenesis and mutagenesis in humans are unknown.</p><p>Polymyxin B Sulfate has been reported to impair the motility of equine sperm, but its effects on male or female fertility are unknown.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Statrol® (Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates Ophthalmic Ointment, USP).
