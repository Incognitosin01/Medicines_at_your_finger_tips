While its vasoconstrictor action is similar to that of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine has less pressor effect in normotensive adults. Serum half-life or pseudoephedrine is 6 to 8 hours. Acidic urine is associated with faster elimination of the drug. About one-half of the administered drug is excreted in the urine.</p><p>Pyrilamine maleate is a histamine antagonist, specifically an H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor-blocking agent belonging to the alkylamine class of antihistamines. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for receptor sites on effector cells. Pyrilamine also has anticholinergic (drying) and sedative effects. Among the antihistaminic effects, it antagonizes the allergic response (vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, increased mucus secretion) of nasal tissue. Pyrilamine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentration after a single, oral dose of 4 mg reached in 5 hours; urinary excretion is the major route of elimination, mostly as products of biodegradation; the liver is assumed to be the main site of metabolic transformation.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Zotex-D Syrup</h2><p class="First">For relief of coughs and upper respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, associated with allergy or the common cold.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to any of its ingredients. Sympathomimetic amines are contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension, severe coronary heart disease and patients on monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy. Antihistamines are contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, peptic ulcer, and during an asthma attack. Dextromethorphan should not be used in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Sympathomimetic amines should be used judiciously and sparingly in patients with hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure, or prostatic hypertrophy, (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). Sympathomimetic amines may produce CNS stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension. The elderly (60 years and older) are more likely to exhibit adverse reactions.</p><p>Antihistamines may cause hyperexcitability, especially in children. At doses higher than the recommended doses, nervousness, dizziness or sleeplessness may occur. Do not exceed recommended dosage.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>GENERAL</h3><p class="First">Before prescribing medication to suppress or modify cough, identify and provide therapy for the underlying cause of the cough and take caution that modification of cough does not increase the risk of clinical or physiologic complications.</p><p>Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart disease, asthma, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure, diabetes mellitus, and prostatic hypertrophy.</p><h3>Information for patients</h3><p class="First">Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking this product. Patients sensitive to antihistamines may experience moderate severe drowsiness. Patients sensitive to sympathomimetics may note mild CNS stimulation.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Antihistamines may enhance the effect of tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, alcohol, and other CNS depressants. MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines. Sympathomimetic amines may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, veratrum alkaloids, methyldopa, and mecamylamine. Effects of sympathomimetics are increased with MAO inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity. Give to pregnant women only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known if the drugs in this product are excreted in human milk. Since many drugs may be excreted into human milk and because of the potential for serious side effects in the nursing infant, this product should only be given to nursing mothers if clearly needed.</p><h3>Pediatric use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of this product in pediatric patients below the age of two years have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Antihistamines</h3><p class="First">Sedation, dizziness, diplopia, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, nervousness, nausea, anorexia, heartburn, weakness, polyuria, and dysuria, and rarely, excitability in children. Urinary retention may occur in patients with prostatic hypertrophy.</p><h3>Sympathomimetic Amines</h3><p class="First">Convulsions, CNS stimulation, cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory difficulties, increased heart rate or blood pressure, hallucinations, tremors, nervousness, insomnia, pallor and dysuria.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The signs, symptoms and treatment described below are those of H<span class="Sub">1</span> antihistamine, pseudoephedrine and dextromethorphan overdose.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Should antihistamine effects predominate, central action constitutes the greatest danger. In the small child, predominate symptoms are excitation, hallucination, ataxia, incoordination, tremors, flushed face and fever. Convulsions, fixed and dilated pupils, coma, and death may occur in severe cases. In the adult, fever and flushing are uncommon; excitement leading to convulsions and postictal depression is often preceded by drowsiness and coma. Respiration is usually not seriously depressed; blood pressure is usually stable.</p><p>Should sympathomimetic symptoms predominate central effects include restlessness, dizziness, tremor, hyperactive reflexes, talkativeness, irritability, and insomnia. Cardiovascular and renal effects include difficulty in micturition, headache, flushing, palpitation, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension with subsequent hypotension and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal effects include dry mouth, metallic taste, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p class="First">a) Evacuate stomach as condition warrants. Activated charcoal may be useful. b) Maintain a non-stimulating environment. c) Monitor cardiovascular status. d) Do not give stimulants. e) Reduce fever with sponging. f) Treat respiratory depression with naloxone if dextromethorphan toxicity is suspected. g) Use sedatives or anticonvulsants to control CNS excitation, and convulsions. h) Physostigmine may reverse anti-cholinergic symptoms. i) Ammonium Chloride may acidify the urine to increase urinary excretion of pseudoephedrine. j) Further care is symptomatic and supportive.</p><h2>Zotex-D Syrup Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and Children 12 years of age and older:</span> 1-2 teaspoonfuls every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 12 teaspoonfuls in a 24 hour period. <span class="Bold">Children 6 to 12 years of age:</span> 1/2 to 1 teaspoonful every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 6 teaspoonfuls in a 24 hour period.</p><p>* In mild cases or in particularly sensitive patients, less frequent or reduced doses may be adequate.</p><h2>How is Zotex-D Syrup Supplied</h2><p class="First">Zotex™-D Syrup is supplied as a clear, cherry-flavored liquid available in 16 fl oz bottles, NDC 68025-036-16 and 10 mL sample bottles, NDC 68025-036-10.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATIONS OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.
