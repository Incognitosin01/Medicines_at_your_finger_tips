Clinical experience and case reports also suggest use may be especially beneficial in patients at high risk for aspiration (eg, patients with a full stomach, severe GERD, gastroparesis, and/or pregnant patients undergoing anesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy) <sup>[Berkow 2019]</sup>, <sup>[Hagberg 2019]</sup>, <sup>[Kellner 2019]</sup>, <sup>[Nixon 2019]</sup>.</p><p>Based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists practice guidelines for obstetric anesthesia, sodium citrate and citric acid with H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist and/or metoclopramide is an effective and recommended prophylactic agent for the prevention of aspiration during surgical procedures (eg, cesarean delivery, postpartum tubal ligation) in pregnant patients.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to sodium citrate, citric acid, or any component of the formulation; severe renal  impairment; oliguria; azotemia; untreated Addison disease; adynamia episodica hereditaria; acute dehydration; heat cramp; anuria; severe myocardial damage; hyperkalemia; sodium-restricted diet.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Acidosis or systemic alkalization:</b> Oral: 10 to 30 mL 4 times daily.</p><p><b>Aspiration prophylaxis in patients undergoing anesthesia (off-label use): Note: </b>May be considered in patients at high risk for aspiration (ASA 2016; Berkow 2019; Hagberg 2019; Lovas 2011; O'Reardon 2011; Rabheru 2001).</p><p>Oral: 30 mL given immediately before surgery in conjunction with other appropriate agents (eg, IV H<sub>2</sub> antagonist and/or IV metoclopramide given ~30 to 90 minutes prior to surgery) (Abir 2019; ASA 2017; Berkow 2019).</p><p><b>Gastric acid buffer</b>: Oral: 15 mL as a single dose.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p>• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Zar 2007).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Administration: Dilute with water to minimize GI injury; administer after meals to minimize saline laxative effect.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Serum creatinine, BUN, LFTs, serum bicarbonate and urinary pH at baseline and as clinically indicated during therapy; periodic serum electrolytes (especially bicarbonate) in patients with renal disease.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use caution with toxemia of pregnancy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat high acid levels in the blood.</p><p>• It is used to lower acid levels in the urine.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
