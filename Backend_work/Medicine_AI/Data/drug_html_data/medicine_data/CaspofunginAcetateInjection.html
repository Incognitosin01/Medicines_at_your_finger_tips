Do not administer caspofungin acetate for injection by IV bolus administration.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients [18 years of age and older]</h3><p class="First">The dosage and duration of caspofungin acetate for injection treatment for each indication are as follows:</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Empirical Therapy for Presumed Fungal Infections in Febrile Neutropenic Patients</span></p><p>Administer a single 70 mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be based on the patient's clinical response. Continue empirical therapy until resolution of neutropenia. In general, treat patients found to have a fungal infection for a minimum of 14 days after the last positive culture and continue treatment for at least 7 days after both neutropenia and clinical symptoms are resolved. If the 50 mg dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Candidemia and Other Candida Infections</span></p><p>Administer a single 70 mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Duration of treatment should be dictated by the patient's clinical and microbiological response. In general, continue antifungal therapy for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. Patients with neutropenia who remain persistently neutropenic may warrant a longer course of therapy pending resolution of the neutropenia.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Esophageal Candidiasis</span></p><p>The dose is 50 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days after symptom resolution. A 70 mg loading dose has not been studied for this indication. Because of the risk of relapse of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with HIV infections, suppressive oral therapy could be considered <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Invasive Aspergillosis</span></p><p>Administer a single 70 mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter.

For adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), caspofungin acetate for injection 35 mg once daily is recommended based upon pharmacokinetic data <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> with a 70 mg loading dose administered on Day 1 where appropriate. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) and in pediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in Patients Receiving Concomitant Inducers of Hepatic CYP Enzymes</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span>:</p><p>Adult patients on rifampin should receive 70 mg of caspofungin acetate for injection once daily. When caspofungin acetate for injection is co-administered to adult patients with other inducers of hepatic CYP enzymes such as nevirapine, efavirenz, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, or phenytoin, administration of a daily dose of 70 mg of caspofungin acetate for injection should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span>:</p><p>Pediatric patients on rifampin should receive 70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of caspofungin acetate for injection daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg). When caspofungin acetate for injection is co-administered to pediatric patients with other inducers of hepatic CYP enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, a caspofungin acetate for injection dose of 70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> once daily (not to exceed 70 mg) should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Preparation for Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics Underline">Reconstitution of Caspofungin for Intravenous Infusion</span></p><p>A. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of caspofungin acetate for injection to room temperature.</p><p>B. Aseptically add 10.8 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, Sterile Water for Injection, Bacteriostatic Water for Injection with methylparaben and propylparaben, or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection with 0.9% benzyl alcohol to the vial.</p><p>C. Each vial of caspofungin acetate for injection contains an intentional overfill of caspofungin acetate for injection. Thus, the volume of diluent to be added to each vial and the drug concentration of the resulting solution is listed in Table 1 below.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Information for Preparation of Caspofungin Acetate for Injection</span></p><p>D. The white to off-white cake will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear solution is obtained. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter or discoloration during reconstitution and prior to infusion. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has precipitated.</p><p>E. The reconstituted solution of caspofungin acetate for injection in the vial may be stored for up to one hour at ≤25°C (≤77°F) prior to the preparation of the infusion solution in the intravenous bag or bottle.</p><p>F. Caspofungin acetate for injection vials are for single-dose only. Discard unused portion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics Underline">Dilution of the Reconstituted Solution in the Intravenous Bag for Infusion</span></p><p>A. Aseptically transfer the appropriate volume (mL) of reconstituted caspofungin acetate for injection to an intravenous (IV) bag (or bottle) containing 250 mL of 0.9%, 0.45%, or 0.225% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers Injection.</p><p>B. Alternatively, the volume (mL) of reconstituted caspofungin acetate for injection can be added to a reduced volume of 0.9%, 0.45%, or 0.225% Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.</p><p>C. This diluted infusion solution in the intravenous bag or bottle must be used within 24 hours if stored at ≤25°C (≤77°F) or within 48 hours if stored refrigerated at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics Underline">Important Reconstitution and Dilution Instructions for Pediatric Patients 3 Months of Age and Older</span></p><p>Follow the reconstitution procedures described above using either the 70 mg or 50 mg vial to create the reconstituted solution <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span> From the reconstituted solution in the vial, remove the volume of drug equal to the calculated loading dose or calculated maintenance dose based on a concentration of 7 mg/mL (if reconstituted from the 70 mg vial) or a concentration of 5 mg/mL (if reconstituted from the 50 mg vial).</p><p>The choice of vial should be based on total milligram dose of drug to be administered to the pediatric patient. To help ensure accurate dosing, it is recommended for pediatric doses less than 50 mg that 50 mg vials (with a concentration of 5 mg/mL) be used if available. The 70 mg vial should be reserved for pediatric patients requiring doses greater than 50 mg.</p><p><span class="Italics">The maximum loading dose and the daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg, regardless of the patient's calculated dose</span>.</p><h3>Drug Incompatibilities</h3><p class="First">Do not mix or co-infuse caspofungin acetate for injection with other medications, as there are no data available on the compatibility of caspofungin acetate for injection with other intravenous substances, additives, or medications.</p><p>Do not use diluents containing dextrose (α-D-glucose), as caspofungin acetate for injection is not stable in diluents containing dextrose.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Caspofungin Acetate for Injection 50 mg is a white to off-white lyophilized cake or powder for reconstitution in a single-dose glass vial with an aluminum seal and a plastic cap. Caspofungin acetate for injection 50 mg vial contains 50 mg of caspofungin equivalent to 55.5 mg of caspofungin acetate.</p><p>Caspofungin Acetate for Injection 70 mg is a white to off-white lyophilized cake or powder for reconstitution in a single-dose glass vial with an aluminum seal and a plastic cap. Caspofungin acetate for injection 70 mg vial contains 70 mg of caspofungin equivalent to 77.7 mg of caspofungin acetate.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Caspofungin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of this product <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during administration of caspofungin.</p><p>Possible histamine-mediated adverse reactions, including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth or bronchospasm have been reported.</p><p>Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some with a fatal outcome, have been reported with use of caspofungin <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue caspofungin at the first sign or symptom of a hypersensitivity reaction and administer appropriate treatment.</p><h3>Hepatic Effects</h3><p class="First">Laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and in adult and pediatric patients treated with caspofungin. In some adult and pediatric patients with serious underlying conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications with caspofungin, isolated cases of clinically significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis, and hepatic failure have been reported; a causal relationship to caspofungin has not been established. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during caspofungin therapy for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing caspofungin therapy.</p><h3>Elevated Liver Enzymes During Concomitant Use with Cyclosporine</h3><p class="First">Elevated liver enzymes have occurred in patients receiving caspofungin and cyclosporine concomitantly. Only use caspofungin and cyclosporine in those patients for whom the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients who develop abnormal liver enzymes during concomitant therapy should be monitored and the risk/benefit of continuing therapy should be evaluated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in detail in another section of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

A short α-phase occurs immediately postinfusion, followed by a β-phase (half-life of 9 to 11 hours) that characterizes much of the profile and exhibits clear log-linear behavior from 6 to 48 hours postdose during which the plasma concentration decreases 10-fold. An additional, longer half-life phase, γ-phase, (half-life of 40-50 hours), also occurs. Distribution, rather than excretion or biotransformation, is the dominant mechanism influencing plasma clearance. Caspofungin is extensively bound to albumin (~97%), and distribution into red blood cells is minimal. Mass balance results showed that approximately 92% of the administered radioactivity was distributed to tissues by 36 to 48 hours after a single 70 mg dose of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H] caspofungin acetate. There is little excretion or biotransformation of caspofungin during the first 30 hours after administration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Metabolism</span></p><p>Caspofungin is slowly metabolized by hydrolysis and N-acetylation. Caspofungin also undergoes spontaneous chemical degradation to an open-ring peptide compound, L-747969. At later time points (≥5 days postdose), there is a low level (≤7 picomoles/mg protein, or ≤1.3% of administered dose) of covalent binding of radiolabel in plasma following single-dose administration of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H] caspofungin acetate, which may be due to two reactive intermediates formed during the chemical degradation of caspofungin to L-747969. Additional metabolism involves hydrolysis into constitutive amino acids and their degradates, including dihydroxyhomotyrosine and N-acetyl-dihydroxyhomotyrosine. These two tyrosine derivatives are found only in urine, suggesting rapid clearance of these derivatives by the kidneys.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Excretion</span></p><p>Two single-dose radiolabeled pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. In one study, plasma, urine, and feces were collected over 27 days, and in the second study plasma was collected over 6 months. Plasma concentrations of radioactivity and of caspofungin were similar during the first 24 to 48 hours postdose; thereafter drug levels fell more rapidly. In plasma, caspofungin concentrations fell below the limit of quantitation after 6 to 8 days postdose, while radiolabel fell below the limit of quantitation at 22.3 weeks postdose. After single intravenous administration of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H] caspofungin acetate, excretion of caspofungin and its metabolites in humans was 35% of dose in feces and 41% of dose in urine. A small amount of caspofungin is excreted unchanged in urine (~1.4% of dose).

Patients with <span class="Italics">Candida</span> endocarditis, meningitis, or osteomyelitis were excluded from this study.</p><p>Patients who met the entry criteria and received one or more doses of IV study therapy were included in the modified intention-to-treat [MITT] analysis of response at the end of IV study therapy. A favorable response at this time point required both symptom/sign resolution/improvement and microbiological clearance of the <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infection.</p><p>Two hundred thirty-nine patients were enrolled. Patient disposition is shown in Table 10.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold">*</span>Patients received caspofungin 70 mg on Day 1, then 50 mg once daily for the remainder of their treatment.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">†</span></span> Study defined as study treatment period and 6-8 week follow-up period.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">‡</span></span> Determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely drug-related.</p><p>Of the 239 patients enrolled, 224 met the criteria for inclusion in the MITT population (109 treated with caspofungin and 115 treated with amphotericin B). Of these 224 patients, 186 patients had candidemia (92 treated with caspofungin and 94 treated with amphotericin B). The majority of the patients with candidemia were non-neutropenic (87%) and had an APACHE II score less than or equal to 20 (77%) in both arms. Most candidemia infections were caused by <span class="Italics">C. albicans</span> (39%), followed by <span class="Italics">C. parapsilosis</span> (20%), <span class="Italics">C. tropicalis</span> (17%), <span class="Italics">C. glabrata</span> (8%), and <span class="Italics">C. krusei</span> (3%).</p><p>At the end of IV study therapy, caspofungin was comparable to amphotericin B in the treatment of candidemia in the MITT population. For the other efficacy time points (Day 10 of IV study therapy, end of all antifungal therapy, 2-week post-therapy follow-up, and 6- to 8-week post-therapy follow-up), caspofungin was as effective as amphotericin B.</p><p>Outcome, relapse and mortality data are shown in Table 11.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold">*</span>Patients received caspofungin 70 mg on Day 1, then 50 mg once daily for the remainder of their treatment.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">†</span></span>Calculated as caspofungin – amphotericin B</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">‡</span></span>95% CI for candidemia, 95.6% for all patients</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">§</span></span>Modified intention-to-treat</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">¶</span></span>Includes all patients who either developed a culture-confirmed recurrence of <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infection or required antifungal therapy for the treatment of a proven or suspected <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infection in the follow-up period.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">#</span></span>Study defined as study treatment period and 6-8 week follow-up period.</p><p>In this study, the efficacy of caspofungin in patients with intra-abdominal abscesses, peritonitis and pleural space <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections was evaluated in 19 non-neutropenic patients. Two of these patients had concurrent candidemia. <span class="Italics">Candida</span> was part of a polymicrobial infection that required adjunctive surgical drainage in 11 of these 19 patients. A favorable response was seen in 9 of 9 patients with peritonitis, 3 of 4 with abscesses (liver, parasplenic, and urinary bladder abscesses), 2 of 2 with pleural space infections, 1 of 2 with mixed peritoneal and pleural infection, 1 of 1 with mixed abdominal abscess and peritonitis, and 0 of 1 with <span class="Italics">Candida</span> pneumonia.</p><p>Overall, across all sites of infection included in the study, the efficacy of caspofungin was comparable to that of amphotericin B for the primary endpoint.</p><p>In this study, the efficacy data for caspofungin in neutropenic patients with candidemia were limited. In a separate compassionate use study, 4 patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis received prolonged therapy with caspofungin following other long-term antifungal therapy; three of these patients had a favorable response.</p><p>In a second randomized, double-blind study, 197 patients with proven invasive candidiasis received caspofungin 50 mg/day (following a 70 mg loading dose on Day 1) or caspofungin 150 mg/day. The diagnostic criteria, evaluation time points, and efficacy endpoints were similar to those employed in the prior study. Patients with <span class="Italics">Candida</span> endocarditis, meningitis, or osteomyelitis were excluded. Although this study was designed to compare the safety of the two doses, it was not large enough to detect differences in rare or unexpected adverse events <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> The efficacy of caspofungin at the 150 mg daily dose was not significantly better than the efficacy of the 50 mg daily dose of caspofungin. The efficacy of doses higher than 50 mg daily in the other adult patients for whom caspofungin is indicated has not been evaluated.</p><h3>Esophageal Candidiasis (and information on oropharyngeal candidiasis)</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of caspofungin in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis was evaluated in one large, controlled, noninferiority, clinical trial and two smaller dose-response studies.</p><p>In all 3 studies, patients were required to have symptoms and microbiological documentation of esophageal candidiasis; most patients had advanced AIDS (with CD4 counts &lt;50/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>).</p><p>Of the 166 patients in the large study who had culture-confirmed esophageal candidiasis at baseline, 120 had <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> and 2 had <span class="Italics">Candida tropicalis</span> as the sole baseline pathogen whereas 44 had mixed baseline cultures containing <span class="Italics">C. albicans</span> and one or more additional <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species.</p><p>In the large, randomized, double-blind study comparing caspofungin 50 mg/day versus intravenous fluconazole 200 mg/day for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, patients were treated for an average of 9 days (range 7-21 days). Favorable overall response at 5 to 7 days following discontinuation of study therapy required both complete resolution of symptoms and significant endoscopic improvement. The definition of endoscopic response was based on severity of disease at baseline using a 4-grade scale and required at least a two-grade reduction from baseline endoscopic score or reduction to grade 0 for patients with a baseline score of 2 or less.</p><p>The proportion of patients with a favorable overall response was comparable for caspofungin and fluconazole as shown in Table 12.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold">*</span>Analysis excluded patients without documented esophageal candidiasis or patients not receiving at least 1 day of study therapy.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">†</span></span>Calculated as caspofungin – fluconazole</p><p>The proportion of patients with a favorable symptom response was also comparable (90.1% and 89.4% for caspofungin and fluconazole, respectively). In addition, the proportion of patients with a favorable endoscopic response was comparable (85.2% and 86.2% for caspofungin and fluconazole, respectively).</p><p>As shown in Table 13, the esophageal candidiasis relapse rates at the Day 14 post-treatment visit were similar for the two groups. At the Day 28 post-treatment visit, the group treated with caspofungin had a numerically higher incidence of relapse; however, the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p class="First Footnote">*Calculated as caspofungin – fluconazole</p><p>In this trial, which was designed to establish noninferiority of caspofungin to fluconazole for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, 122 (70%) patients also had oropharyngeal candidiasis. A favorable response was defined as complete resolution of all symptoms of oropharyngeal disease and all visible oropharyngeal lesions. The proportion of patients with a favorable oropharyngeal response at the 5- to 7-day post-treatment visit was numerically lower for caspofungin; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Oropharyngeal candidiasis relapse rates at Day 14 and Day 28 post-treatment visits were statistically significantly higher for caspofungin than for fluconazole. The results are shown in Table 14.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold">*</span> Calculated as caspofungin – fluconazole</p><p>The results from the two smaller dose-ranging studies corroborate the efficacy of caspofungin for esophageal candidiasis that was demonstrated in the larger study.</p><p>Caspofungin was associated with favorable outcomes in 7 of 10 esophageal <span class="Italics">C. albicans</span> infections refractory to at least 200 mg of fluconazole given for 7 days, although the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility of the infecting isolates to fluconazole was not known.</p><h3>Invasive Aspergillosis</h3><p class="First">Sixty-nine patients between the ages of 18 and 80 with invasive aspergillosis were enrolled in an open-label, noncomparative study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of caspofungin. Enrolled patients had previously been refractory to or intolerant of other antifungal therapy(ies). Refractory patients were classified as those who had disease progression or failed to improve despite therapy for at least 7 days with amphotericin B, lipid formulations of amphotericin B, itraconazole, or an investigational azole with reported activity against <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span>. Intolerance to previous therapy was defined as a doubling of creatinine (or creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL while on therapy), other acute reactions, or infusion-related toxicity. To be included in the study, patients with pulmonary disease must have had definite (positive tissue histopathology or positive culture from tissue obtained by an invasive procedure) or probable (positive radiographic or computed tomography evidence with supporting culture from bronchoalveolar lavage or sputum, galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and/or polymerase chain reaction) invasive aspergillosis. Patients with extrapulmonary disease had to have definite invasive aspergillosis. Patients were administered a single 70 mg loading dose of caspofungin and subsequently dosed with 50 mg daily. The mean duration of therapy was 33.7 days, with a range of 1 to 162 days.</p><p>An independent expert panel evaluated patient data, including diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, response and tolerability to previous antifungal therapy, treatment course on caspofungin, and clinical outcome.</p><p>A favorable response was defined as either complete resolution (complete response) or clinically meaningful improvement (partial response) of all signs and symptoms and attributable radiographic findings. Stable, nonprogressive disease was considered to be an unfavorable response.</p><p>Among the 69 patients enrolled in the study, 63 met entry diagnostic criteria and had outcome data; and of these, 52 patients received treatment for greater than 7 days. Fifty-three (84%) were refractory to previous antifungal therapy and 10 (16%) were intolerant. Forty-five patients had pulmonary disease and 18 had extrapulmonary disease. Underlying conditions were hematologic malignancy (N=24), allogeneic bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant (N=18), organ transplant (N=8), solid tumor (N=3), or other conditions (N=10). All patients in the study received concomitant therapies for their other underlying conditions. Eighteen patients received tacrolimus and caspofungin concomitantly, of whom 8 also received mycophenolate mofetil.</p><p>Overall, the expert panel determined that 41% (26/63) of patients receiving at least one dose of caspofungin had a favorable response. For those patients who received greater than 7 days of therapy with caspofungin, 50% (26/52) had a favorable response. The favorable response rates for patients who were either refractory to or intolerant of previous therapies were 36% (19/53) and 70% (7/10), respectively. The response rates among patients with pulmonary disease and extrapulmonary disease were 47% (21/45) and 28% (5/18), respectively. Among patients with extrapulmonary disease, 2 of 8 patients who also had definite, probable, or possible CNS involvement had a favorable response. Two of these 8 patients had progression of disease and manifested CNS involvement while on therapy.</p><p>Caspofungin is effective for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of itraconazole, amphotericin B, and/or lipid formulations of amphotericin B. However, the efficacy of caspofungin for initial treatment of invasive aspergillosis has not been evaluated in comparator-controlled clinical studies.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of caspofungin were evaluated in pediatric patients 3 months to 17 years of age in two prospective, multicenter clinical trials.</p><p>The first study, which enrolled 82 patients between 2 to 17 years of age, was a randomized, double-blind study comparing caspofungin (50 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> IV once daily following a 70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> loading dose on Day 1 [not to exceed 70 mg daily]) to AmBisome (3 mg/kg IV daily) in a 2:1 treatment fashion (56 on caspofungin, 26 on AmBisome) as empirical therapy in pediatric patients with persistent fever and neutropenia. The study design and criteria for efficacy assessment were similar to the study in adult patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span> Patients were stratified based on risk category (high-risk patients had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation or had relapsed acute leukemia). Twenty-seven percent of patients in both treatment groups were high risk. Favorable overall response rates of pediatric patients with persistent fever and neutropenia are presented in Table 15.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold">*</span>One patient excluded from analysis due to no fever at study entry.</p><p>The second study was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative study estimating the safety and efficacy of caspofungin in pediatric patients (ages 3 months to 17 years) with candidemia and other <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections, esophageal candidiasis, and invasive aspergillosis (as salvage therapy). The study employed diagnostic criteria which were based on established EORTC/MSG criteria of proven or probable infection; these criteria were similar to those criteria employed in the adult studies for these various indications. Similarly, the efficacy time points and endpoints used in this study were similar to those employed in the corresponding adult studies <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2</span>, <span class="Italics">14.3</span>, <span class="Italics">and 14.4)].</span> All patients received caspofungin at 50 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> IV once daily following a 70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> loading dose on Day 1 (not to exceed 70 mg daily). Among the 49 enrolled patients who received caspofungin, 48 were included in the efficacy analysis (one patient excluded due to not having a baseline <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span> or <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infection). Of these 48 patients, 37 had candidemia or other <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections, 10 had invasive aspergillosis, and 1 patient had esophageal candidiasis. Most candidemia and other <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections were caused by <span class="Italics">C. albicans</span> (35%), followed by <span class="Italics">C. parapsilosis</span> (22%), <span class="Italics">C. tropicalis</span> (14%), and <span class="Italics">C. glabrata</span> (11%). The favorable response rate, by indication, at the end of caspofungin therapy was as follows: 30/37 (81%) in candidemia or other <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections, 5/10 (50%) in invasive aspergillosis, and 1/1 in esophageal candidiasis.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
