Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed. Using  methylphenidate improperly can cause death or serious side effects on the heart.</p><p>Methylphenidate may be habit-forming. <b>Misuse can cause addiction, overdose, or death.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Apply the patch to a clean and dry area on your hip. The effects of this medicine may not be noticeable until 2 hours after applying the skin patch.</p><p>Wash your hands after applying a skin patch.</p><p>Remove the patch 9 hours after it was applied. Peel off slowly and fold the patch in half so it sticks together. Flush the folded patch down the toilet or place it into a waste can with a lid.</p><p>If a patch falls off, replace it with a new one. Do not wear a patch longer than 9 hours per day, even if you apply a new patch to replace one that has fallen off.</p><p>Apply a new patch to the opposite hip. Do not wear a patch on the same side of the body two days in a row.</p><p>If you have loss of appetite or trouble sleeping, try removing the skin patch earlier in the day. Never cut the skin patch to try and reduce the amount of medicine you receive while wearing it.</p><p>Children using this medicine should be warned never to remove the skin patch and place it onto another person. Serious side effects may result.</p><p>Over time, methylphenidate transdermal can cause your skin to lighten around areas where the patches are worn. This effect may be permanent. Tell your doctor if you see new areas of lighter color under or around a skin patch.</p><p>Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits. Your heart rate, blood pressure, height and weight may also need to be checked often.</p><p>Store at room temperature. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Keep each patch in its sealed pouch until you are ready to use it. Throw away unused patches if it has been more than 2 months since you opened the original package.</p><p>Keep track of your medicine. You should be aware if anyone is using it improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>If you discontinue using methylphenidate transdermal, fold together and flush any unused patches at that time.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Apply a patch as soon as you remember, and do not wear the patch for longer than 9 hours. You may need to shorten the wearing time to less than 9 hours if you apply a patch later than usual and you have sleep problems. Do not apply two patches at the same time to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.

This includes heat from a heating pad, hot tub, electric blanket, or a heated water bed. Heat can cause the skin patch to release too much medicine at one time.</p><p>Avoid placing a patch on skin that is oily, irritated, or damaged. Avoid a skin area that will be rubbed by a waistband or tight clothing.</p><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how  methylphenidate will affect you.
