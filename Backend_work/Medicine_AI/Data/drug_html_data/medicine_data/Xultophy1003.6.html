Strengths</h2><p class="First">Xultophy 100/3.6 injection: 100 units insulin degludec per mL and 3.6 mg liraglutide per mL available as a clear, colorless solution in a 3 mL pre-filled, disposable, single-patient-use pen injector.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Xultophy 100/3.6 is contraindicated:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors</h3><p class="First">Liraglutide, one of the components of Xultophy 100/3.6, causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether Xultophy 100/3.6 will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.</p><p>Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and liraglutide use in humans.</p><p>Xultophy 100/3.6 is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of Xultophy 100/3.6 and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).</p><p>Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with Xultophy 100/3.6. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values &gt;50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide, one of the components of Xultophy 100/3.6. In glycemic control trials of liraglutide, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among liraglutide-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with liraglutide were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a liraglutide-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse.</p><p>After initiation of Xultophy 100/3.6, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, Xultophy 100/3.6 should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, restarting Xultophy 100/3.6 is not recommended.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Liraglutide, one of the components of Xultophy 100/3.6, has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on liraglutide.</span></p><h3>Never Share a Xultophy 100/3.6 Pen Between Patients</h3><p class="First">Xultophy 100/3.6 pen must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Sharing of the pen poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.</p><h3>Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span></span><span class="Italics">5.6<span class="following_xmChange">)]</span></span> <span class="following_xmChange">or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span></span><span class="Italics">6.1<span class="following_xmChange">,</span> 6.3<span class="following_xmChange">)].</span></span> <span class="following_xmChange">Make any changes to a patient’s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia</span>. Adjustments in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment may be needed. When initiating Xultophy 100/3.6, follow dosing recommendations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Overdose due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Xultophy 100/3.6 contains two drugs: insulin degludec and liraglutide. Administration of more than 50 units of Xultophy 100/3.6 daily can result in overdose of the liraglutide component. Do not exceed the 1.8 mg maximum recommended dose of liraglutide or use with other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.</p><p>Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Xultophy 100/3.6 (an insulin containing product) and other insulin products, instruct patients to always check the label before each injection.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin containing products, including Xultophy 100/3.6 <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Xultophy 100/3.6 (an insulin-containing product) or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see</span> C<span class="Italics">ontraindications (4</span>)<span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p>Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1</span>)<span class="Italics">]</span>, or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control. The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span> and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin containing products, the glucose lowering effect time course of Xultophy 100/3.6 may vary among different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature.</p><p>Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations</span><span class="Italics">(8.6, 8.7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.</p><h3>Acute Kidney Injury</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in patients treated with liraglutide, one of the components of Xultophy 100/3.6 <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]</span>. Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide. Advise patients of the potential risk of dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock can occur with Xultophy 100/3.6.Allergic reactions (manifested with signs and symptoms such as urticaria, rash, pruritus) have been reported with Xultophy 100/3.6. There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide, one of the components of Xultophy 100/3.6 <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]</span>. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Xultophy 100/3.6; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with Xultophy 100/3.6. Xultophy 100/3.6 is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin degludec, liraglutide or one of the excipients of these products <span class="Italics">[</span>see Contraindications <span class="Italics">(</span>4<span class="Italics">)].</span></span></p><h3>Acute Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">In a cardiovascular outcomes trial (LEADER trial) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)],</span> 3.1% of patients treated with liraglutide, one of the components of Xultophy 100/3.6, versus 1.9% of placebo treated patients reported an acute event of gallbladder disease, such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. The majority of events required hospitalization or cholecystectomy. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated</span>.</p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">All insulin-containing products, including Xultophy 100/3.6, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).</p><h3>Fluid Retention and Congestive Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of a PPAR Gamma Agonist</h3><p class="First">Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists can cause dose related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin containing products, including Xultophy 100/3.6. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with insulin containing products, including Xultophy 100/3.6 and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information:</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Xultophy 100/3.6</span></span></p><p>The data in Table 3 reflect the exposure of 1881 patients to Xultophy 100/3.6 and a mean duration of exposure of 33 weeks.

For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Xultophy 100/3.6 with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.</p><p>In the phase 3 clinical program <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>, events of severe hypoglycemia were defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions (Table 4). Hypoglycemia episodes with a glucose level below 54 mg/dL associated with or without symptoms is shown in Table 4. No clinically important differences in risk of severe hypoglycemia between Xultophy 100/3.6 and comparators were observed in clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Hypoglycemia Episodes Reported in Xultophy 100/3.6-Treated Patients with T2DM</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients naïve to basal insulin or GLP-1 receptor agonist</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients currently on GLP-1 receptor agonist</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients Currently on basal insulin</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">NCT01336023</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Xultophy 100/3.6<br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">NCT01618162</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Xultophy 100/3.6</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">NCT02773368</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Xultophy 100/3.6</span></p><p><span class="Bold">NCT01676116</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Xultophy 100/3.6</span></p><p><span class="Bold">NCT01392573</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Xultophy 100/3.6</span></p><p><span class="Bold">NCT01952145</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Total Subjects (N)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">825</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">288</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">209</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">291</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">199</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">278</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Severe Hypoglycemia</span> (%)†</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.7</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">Hypoglycemia with a glucose level &lt;54 mg/dL (%)*</p><p class="First">27.6</p><p class="First">37.2</p><p class="First">14.4</p><p class="First">27.1</p><p class="First">22.1</p><p class="First">24.8</p><p>*Episodes of hypoglycemia with a glucose level below 54 mg/dL that are associated with or without symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Gastrointestinal adverse reactions including nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, gastritis, abdominal pain, flatulence, eructation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal distension and decreased appetite have been reported in patients treated with Xultophy 100/3.6.
