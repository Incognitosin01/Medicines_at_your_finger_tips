</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Demecarium, echothiophate, and isoflurophate are used in the eye to treat certain types of glaucoma and other eye conditions, such as accommodative esotropia. They may also be used in the diagnosis of certain eye conditions, such as accommodative esotropia.</p><p>These medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Demecarium, echothiophate, or isoflurophate can cause serious side effects in any patient. When this medicine is used for a long time, eye cysts may occur. These eye cysts occur more often in children than in adults. Therefore, it is especially important that you discuss with the child's doctor the good that this medicine may do as well as the risks of using it.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of these medicines in the elderly with use in other age groups. However, demecarium, echothiophate, or isoflurophate can cause serious side effects in any patient.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Because of the toxicity of these medicines in general, demecarium, echothiophate, and isoflurophate are not recommended during pregnancy.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Demecarium, echothiophate, and isoflurophate may be absorbed into the body. These medicines are not recommended during breast-feeding, because they may cause unwanted effects in nursing babies. It may be necessary for you to use another medicine or to stop breast-feeding during treatment. Be sure you have discussed the risks and benefits of the medicine with your doctor.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Asthma or</li>
<li>Epilepsy or</li>
<li>Heart disease or</li>
<li>High or low blood pressure (severe) or</li>
<li>Myasthenia gravis or</li>
<li>Overactive thyroid or</li>
<li>Parkinsonism or</li>
<li>Stomach ulcer or other stomach problems or</li>
<li>Urinary tract blockage—If this medicine is absorbed into the body, it may make the condition worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Down's syndrome (Trisomy21)—This medicine may cause these children to become hyperactive.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Eye disease or problems (other)—May increase absorption of this medicine into the body or this medicine may make the condition worse</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p>To use the <i>ophthalmic solution (eye drops) form</i> of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.</li>
<li>Remove any excess solution around the eye with a clean tissue, being careful not to touch the eye.</li>
<li>Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.</li>
<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed.</li>
<li>The preservative in the eye drops containing the medicine, demecarium, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. If you wear soft contact lenses, and your doctor has informed you that you can wear them while taking this medication, you should wait at least 15 minutes after applying the eye drops before inserting your lenses.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>ophthalmic ointment (eye ointment) form</i> of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Squeeze a thin strip of ointment into this space. A ½-cm (approximately ¼-inch) strip of ointment is usually enough, unless you have been told by your doctor to use a different amount. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Keep the eyes closed for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.</li>
<li>Immediately after using the eye ointment, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them.</li>
<li>Since isoflurophate loses its effectiveness when exposed to moisture, do not wash the tip of the ointment tube or allow it to touch any moist surface (including the eye).</li>
<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). After using this eye ointment, wipe the tip of the ointment tube with a clean tissue and keep the tube tightly closed.</li>
</ul><p><i>It is very important that you use this medicine only as directed</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of too much medicine being absorbed into the body and the chance of side effects.</p><p>If the applicator tip touches any surface (including the eye), it may become contaminated with bacteria, which may increase the chance of developing an eye infection. If you think the applicator has become contaminated, notify your doctor immediately.</p><p>Eye ointment usually causes blurred vision for a short time after you use it, and eye drops containing these medicines may affect your vision for several hours after you use them. Therefore, ask your doctor if the dose (or one of the doses if you use more than 1 dose a day) can be used at bedtime.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>For demecarium
