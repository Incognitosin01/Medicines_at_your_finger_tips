</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Use of Quinine Sulfate Capsules for Treatment or Prevention of Nocturnal Leg Cramps</h3><p class="First">Quinine Sulfate Capsules may cause unpredictable serious and life-threatening hematologic reactions including thrombocytopenia and hemolytic-uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP) in addition to hypersensitivity reactions, QT prolongation, serious cardiac arrhythmias including torsades de pointes, and other serious adverse events requiring medical intervention and hospitalization. Chronic renal impairment associated with the development of TTP, and fatalities have also been reported. The risk associated with the use of Quinine Sulfate Capsules in the absence of evidence of its effectiveness for treatment or prevention of nocturnal leg cramps, outweighs any potential benefit in treating and/or preventing this benign, self-limiting condition <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">Quinine-induced thrombocytopenia is an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported, including cases of HUS/TTP. Chronic renal impairment associated with the development of TTP has also been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of quinine. If quinine is not stopped, a patient is at risk for fatal hemorrhage. Upon re-exposure to quinine from any source, a patient with quinine-dependent antibodies could develop thrombo cytopenia that is more rapid in onset and more severe than the original episode.</p><h3>Hemolytic Anemia</h3><p class="First">Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in patients receiving quinine for treatment of malaria, including patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The cause for the acute hemolytic anemia in quinine-treated patients with malaria and its potential relationship with G6PD deficiency has not been determined. Closely monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit during quinine treatment. Quinine should be discontinued if patients develop acute hemolytic anemia.</p><h3>QT Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">QT interval prolongation has been a consistent finding in studies which evaluated electrocardiographic changes with oral or parenteral quinine administration, regardless of age, clinical status, or severity of disease. The maximum increase in QT interval has been shown to correspond with peak quinine plasma concentration <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span> Quinine sulfate has been rarely associated with potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, and ventricular fibrillation.</p><p>Quinine sulfate has been shown to cause concentration-dependent prolongation of the PR and QRS interval. At particular risk are patients with underlying structural heart disease and preexisting conduction system abnormalities, elderly patients with sick sinus syndrome, patients with atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, patients with myocardial ischemia or patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (e.g. verapamil) or QRS interval (e.g. flecainide or quinidine) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Quinine sulfate is not recommended for use with other drugs known to cause QT prolongation, including Class IA antiarrhythmic agents (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide), and Class III antiarrhythmic agents (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide).</p><p>The use of macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin should be avoided in patients receiving quinine sulfate. Fatal torsades de pointes was reported in an elderly patient who received concomitant quinine, erythromycin, and dopamine.</p><p>Although a causal relationship between a specific drug and the arrhythmia was not established in this case, erythromycin is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and has been shown to increase quinine plasma levels when used concomitantly. A related macrolide antibiotic, troleandomycin, has also been shown to increase quinine exposure in a pharmacokinetic study <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p>Quinine may inhibit the metabolism of certain drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates and are known to cause QT prolongation, e.g., astemizole, cisapride, terfenadine, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine. Torsades de pointes has been reported in patients who received concomitant quinine and astemizole.</p><p>Therefore, concurrent use of quinine sulfate with these medications, or drugs with similar properties, should be avoided <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of quinine sulfate with the antimalarial drugs, mefloquine or halofantrine, may result in electrocardiographic abnormalities, including QT prolongation, and increase the risk for torsades de pointes or other serious ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>Concurrent use of quinine sulfate and mefloquine may also increase the risk of seizures <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> </p><p>Quinine sulfate should also be avoided in patients with known prolongation of QT interval and in patients with clinical conditions known to prolong the QT interval, such as uncorrected hypokalemia, bradycardia, and certain cardiac conditions <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Concomitant Use of Rifampin</h3><p class="First">Treatment failures may result from the concurrent use of rifampin with quinine sulfate, due to decreased plasma concentrations of quinine, and concomitant use of these medications should be avoided <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> </p><h3>Concomitant Use of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">The use of neuromuscular blocking agents should be avoided in patients receiving quinine sulfate. In one patient who received pancuronium during an operative procedure, subsequent administration of quinine resulted in respiratory depression and apnea. Although there are no clinical reports with succinylcholine or tubocurarine, quinine may also potentiate neuromuscular blockade when used with these drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Serious hypersensitivity reactions reported with quinine sulfate include anaphylactic shock, anaphylactoid reactions, urticaria, serious skin rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, facial edema, bronchospasm, and pruritus. A number of other serious adverse reactions reported with quinine, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), blackwater fever, disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukopenia, neutropenia, granulomatous hepatitis, and acute interstitial nephritis may also be due to hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>Quinine sulfate should be discontinued in case of any signs or symptoms of hypersen sitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter</h3><p class="First">Quinine sulfate should be used with caution in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. A paradoxical increase in ventricular response rate may occur with quinine, similar to that observed with quinidine. If digoxin is used to prevent a rapid ventricular response, serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored, because digoxin levels may be increased with use of quinine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> </p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Quinine stimulates release of insulin from the pancreas, and patients, especially pregnant women, may experience clinically significant hypoglycemia.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Overall</h3><p class="First">Quinine can adversely affect almost every body system. The most common adverse events associated with quinine use are a cluster of symptoms called "cinchonism", which occurs to some degree in almost all patients taking quinine.</p><p>Symptoms of mild cinchonism include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception. More severe symptoms of cinchonism are vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in cardiac rhythm or conduction. Most symptoms of cinchonism are reversible and resolve with discontinuation of quinine.</p><p> The following adverse reactions have been reported with quinine sulfate.  Because these reactions have been reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">General:</span> fever, chills, sweating, flushing, asthenia, lupus-like syndrome, and hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hematologic:</span> agranulocytosis, hypoprothrombinemia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolytic anemia; hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, petechiae, ecchymosis, hemorrhage, coagulopathy, blackwater fever, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, and lupus anticoagulant.</p><p><span class="Bold">Neuropsychiatric:</span> headache, diplopia, confusion, altered mental status, seizures, coma, disorientation, tremors, restlessness, ataxia, acute dystonic reaction, aphasia, and suicide.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dermatologic:</span> cutaneous rashes, including urticarial, papular, or scarlatinal rashes, pruritus, bullous dermati tis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fixed drug eruption, photosensitivity reactions, allergic contact dermatitis, acral necrosis, and cutaneous vasculitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory:</span> asthma, dyspnea, pulmonary edema.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular:</span> chest pain, vasodilatation, hypotension, postural hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations, syncope, atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, irregular rhythm, unifocal premature ventricular contractions, nodal escape beats, U waves, QT prolongation, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, and cardiac arrest.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal:</span> nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, gastric irritation, and esophagitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatobiliary:</span> granulomatous hepatitis, hepatitis, jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolic:</span> hypoglycemia and anorexia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal:</span> myalgias and muscle weakness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal:</span> hemoglobinuria, renal failure, renal impairment, and acute interstitial nephritis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Senses:</span> visual disturbances, including blurred vision with scotomata, sudden loss of vision, photophobia, diplopia, night blindness, diminished visual fields, fixed pupillary dilatation, disturbed color vision, optic neuritis, blindness, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing impairment, and deafness.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Table 1 below presents clinically significant drug interactions with Quinine Sulfate Capsules.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Prolonged experience with quinine in pregnant women over several decades, based on published prospective and retrospective observational studies, surveys, safety and efficacy studies, review articles, case reports and case series have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p>In animal reproduction studies, administration of quinine by multiple routes of administration to pregnant rabbits, dogs, guinea pigs, rats, and monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses of 0.25 to 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA), produced embryo-fetal toxicity including malformations. Offspring of pregnant rats administered oral quinine sulfate during mating, gestation, and lactation at a dose approximately equivalent to 0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison experienced impaired growth and delayed physical development <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Malaria during and after pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, including maternal anemia, severe malaria, spontaneous abortion, stillbirths, preterm delivery, low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, congenital malaria, and maternal and neonatal mortality.</p><p><span class="Italics">Maternal adverse reactions</span> </p><p>An increased incidence of hypoglycemia, due to increased pancreatic secretion of insulin, has been reported with quinine use, in pregnant women, especially during the third trimester<span class="Sup">1</span>.

Pregnant women are also at risk for a rare triad of complications: massive hemolysis, hemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or delivery</span></p><p>In doses several times higher than those used to treat malaria, quinine may cause uterine contractions; however, there is no evidence that quinine causes uterine contractions at the doses recommended for the treatment of malaria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Quinine crosses the placenta with measurable blood concentrations in the fetus. In 8 women who delivered live infants 1 to 6 days after starting quinine therapy, umbilical cord plasma quinine concentrations were between 1.0 and 4.6 mg/L (mean 2.4 mg/L) and the mean (±SD) ratio of cord plasma to maternal plasma quinine concentrations was 0.32 ± 0.14. Quinine levels in the fetus may not be therapeutic.</p><p>Adverse outcomes have been identified in the post-marketing experience with quinine during pregnancy. Because these outcomes are reported from varied data sources and have inconsistent findings and/or important methodological limitations, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>In studies in which more than 893 pregnant women were treated with quinine for malaria in the first trimester, no quinine-associated increases in the incidence of congenital anomalies were observed compared with other antimalarial drugs<span class="Sup">3</span>.</p><p>A retrospective study of women with <span class="Italics">P. falciparum</span> malaria who were treated with oral quinine sulfate 10 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 days at any time in pregnancy reported no significant difference in the rate of stillbirths at &gt;28 weeks of gestation in women treated with quinine (10 of 633 women [1.6%]) as compared with a control group without malaria or exposure to antimalarial drugs during pregnancy (40 of 2201 women [1.8%]). The overall rate of congenital malformations (9 of 633 offspring [1.4%]) was not different for women who were treated with quinine sulfate compared with the control group (38 of 2201 offspring [1.7%]). The spontaneous abortion rate was higher in the control group (10.9%) than in women treated with quinine sulfate (3.5%) [OR = 3.1; 95% CI 2.1 to 4.7]. An epidemiologic survey that included 104 mother-child pairs exposed to quinine during the first 4 months of pregnancy, found no increased risk of structural birth defects was seen (2 fetal malformations [1.9%]). Case reports describe deafness and optic nerve hypoplasia in children exposed in utero due to maternal ingestion of high doses of quinine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In animal developmental studies conducted in multiple animal species<span class="Sup">4</span>, pregnant animals received quinine by the subcutaneous, intramuscular, and oral routes at doses 0.25 to 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA). Increases in fetal death were observed in utero in pregnant rabbits at maternal doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day and in pregnant dogs at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day corresponding to dose levels approximately 0.5 and 0.25 times the MR HD respectively based on BSA comparisons. Rabbit offspring had increased rates of degenerated auditory nerve and spiral ganglion and increased rates of CNS anomalies such as anencephaly and microcephaly at a dose of 130 mg/kg/day corresponding to a maternal dose approximately 1.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Guinea pig offspring had increased rates of cochlear hemorrhage at maternal doses of 200 mg/kg corresponding to a dose level of approximately 1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. No fetal malformations were observed in rats at maternal doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and in monkeys at maternal doses up to 200 mg/kg/day corresponding to doses approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD respectively based on BSA comparisons.</p><p>In a pre-postnatal study, pregnant rats received quinine sulfate in feed beginning two weeks prior to mating, through gestation, and lactation. An estimated oral dose of quinine sulfate of 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison resulted in offspring with impaired growth, lower body weights at birth and during the lactation period, and delayed physical development of teeth eruption and eye opening during the lactation period.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Quinine is present in human milk. It is estimated that breastfed infants would receive less than 2 to 3 mg per day of quinine base (&lt; 0.4% of the maternal dose) via breast milk <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> There are no data on the effects of quinine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Quinine Sulfate Capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Quinine Sulfate Capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>No toxicity was reported in infants in a single study where oral quinine sulfate (10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 1 to 10 days) was administered to 25 lactating women.

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Clearance of quinine is decreased in patients with severe chronic renal failure. The dosage and dosing frequency should be reduced <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), quinine oral clearance (CL/F) is decreased, volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">d</span>/F) is increased, and half-life is prolonged, relative to subjects with normal liver function. Therefore, quinine is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment and alternate therapy should be administered <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Close monitoring is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, as exposure to quinine may be increased relative to subjects with normal liver function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Quinine overdose can be associated with serious complications, including visual impairment, hypoglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. Visual impairment can range from blurred vision and defective color perception, to visual field constriction and permanent blindness. Cinchonism occurs in virtually all patients with quinine overdose. Symptoms range from headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing impairment, sweating, flushing, and blurred vision, to deafness, blindness, serious cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Central nervous system toxicity (drowsiness, disturbances of consciousness, ataxia, convulsions, respiratory depression and coma) has also been reported with quinine overdose, as well as pulmonary edema and adult respiratory distress syndrome.</p><p>Most toxic reactions are dose-related; however, some reactions may be idiosyncratic because of the variable sensitivity of patients to the toxic effects of quinine. A lethal dose of quinine has not been clearly defined, but fatalities have been reported after the ingestion of 2 to 8 grams in adults.</p><p>Quinine, like quinidine, has Class I antiarrhythmic properties. The cardiotoxicity of quinine is due to its negative inotropic action, and to its effect on cardiac conduction, resulting in decreased rates of depolarization and conduction, and increased action potential and effective refractory period. ECG changes observed with quinine overdose include sinus tachycardia, PR prolongation, T wave inversion, bundle branch block, an increased QT interval, and a widening of the QRS complex. Quinine's alpha-blocking properties may result in hypotension and further exacerbate myocardial depression by decreasing coronary perfusion. Quinine overdose has been also associated with hypotension, cardiogenic shock, and circulatory collapse, ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, idioventricular rhythm, and torsades de pointes, as well as bradycardia, and atrioventricular block <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Quinine is rapidly absorbed, and attempts to remove residual quinine sulfate from the stomach by gastric lavage may not be effective. Multiple-dose activated charcoal has been shown to decrease plasma quinine concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Forced acid diuresis, hemodialysis, charcoal column hemoperfusion, and plasma exchange were not found to be effective in significantly increasing quinine elimination in a series of 16 patients.</p><h2>Quinine Sulfate Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Quinine sulfate is a cinchona alkaloid chemically described as cinchonan-9-ol, 6'-methoxy-, (8α, 9R)-, sulfate (2:1) (salt), dihydrate with a molecular formula of (C<span class="Sub">20</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>)<span class="Sub">2</span>•H<span class="Sub">2</span>SO<span class="Sub">4</span>•2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and a molecular weight of 782.96.</p><p>The structural formula of quinine sulfate is:</p><p>Quinine sulfate occurs as a white, crystalline powder that darkens on exposure to light.
