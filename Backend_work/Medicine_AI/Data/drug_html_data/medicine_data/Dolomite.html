Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Dolomite dust may cause respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, phlegm, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath), especially among exposed workers.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>Dolomite preparations contaminated with heavy metals may lead to toxicities with long-term use.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Dolomite was described as a rock by the French geologist Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu in 1791 and has been used as a calcium and magnesium supplement in animal feeds.Dolomite 2005 Gardeners commonly add dolomite to soils as a source of magnesium. Dolomite as a dietary supplement is available in several doseforms.</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Dolomite is a form of limestone, rich in approximately equal parts of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate.Mizoguchi 2005 Found throughout the world, dolomitic limestone contains about 5 times as much magnesium and about 63% less calcium than common limestone. Dolomite also contains small amounts of chlorine, phosphorus, potassium, and more than 20 other trace elements.Dolomite 2005</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Bone</h3><p>Limited studies in rodents suggest that dolomite is a source of magnesium. In a 9-week study of ovariectomized rats, dolomite increased circulating serum magnesium and decreased serum calcium levels. However, dolomite did not improve bone histological indices such as bone mass.Mizoguchi 2005 In another rodent study, dolomite repaired bone damage more effectively than the negative control; however, dolomite was less effective than the positive control (bovine bone).Moreschi 2010</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Clinical information is lacking. No recent clinical studies support dosing recommendations for dolomite.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>A rash diagnosed as pityriasis rubra pilaris has been reported.Iraji 2013 Dolomite dust may cause respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, phlegm, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath), especially among exposed workers.Neghab 2012</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Dolomite preparations contaminated with heavy metals may lead to toxicities with long-term use. Dolomite supplements had higher rates of lead contamination than other calcium sources.Mattos 2006 Calcium supplements made from sedimentary rocks (including dolomite and chalk) have higher polonium levels than organic calcium compounds.Strumińska-Parulska 2015</p><p>Short-term toxicity studies in rats did not result in mortality with dolomite 2 g/kg. During organogenesis (day 6 to 17 post-conception), dolomite did not induce maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity in rats.Lagarto 2013</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
