</ul><h2>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h2><p class="First">Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are indicated for the treatment of tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures and prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during or following neurosurgery.</p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">2.1 Adult Dosage</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Divided daily dosage:</span></p><p>The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Once-a-day dosage:</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently.</p><p>Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out.</p><p><span class="Bold">Loading dose:</span></p><p>Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen.</p><p>Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules are divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals.</p><p>Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations.</p><p><span class="Bold">2.2 Pediatric Dosage</span></p><p>The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day).</p><p><span class="Bold">2.3 Dosage Adjustments</span></p><p>Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient’s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual’s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><p>With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin-125 suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parental phenytoin  are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa.</p><p><span class="Bold">2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">2.6 Geriatric Dosage</span></p><p>Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsules dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span> Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS &amp; STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are available as:</p><p>100 mg: Transparent # 3 capsule filled with white to off-white powder, with the code '402' imprinted on the cap and body.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>A history of hypersensitivity to phenytoin, its inactive ingredients, or other hydantoins <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</li>
<li> A history of prior acute hepatotoxicity attributable to phenytoin [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>Coadministration with delavirdine because of the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus</span></p><p>Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions</span></p><p>Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLAB* 1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502.</p><p>The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity</span></p><p>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system  involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.5 Hypersensitivity</span></p><p>Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.6 Hepatic Injury</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span> Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.7 Hematopoietic Complications</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression.</p><p> </p><p>There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><p>In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.8 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone</span></p><p>The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia</span></p><p>Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria</span></p><p>In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn</span></p><p>Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse development outcomes <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p>Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma.</p><p>The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin, during pregnancy is about 10%, or two- to three- fold that in the general population.</p><p>A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.12 Slow Metabolizers of Phenytoin</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be caused by limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose-related CNS toxicity develop, serum levels should be checked immediately.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">5.13 Hyperglycemia</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug’s inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">5.14 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as “delirium,” “psychosis,” or “encephalopathy,” or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy.

Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and Appendages:</span> Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.

Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Infant breast-feeding is not recommended for women taking this drug because phenytoin appears to be secreted in low concentrations in human milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Lower or less frequent dosing may be required <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><h3>Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia</h3><p class="First">The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity.</p><p>Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression.</p><p>There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment:</span> Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote.</p><p>The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients.</p><p>In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind.</p><h2>Phenytoin Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Phenytoin sodium is related to the barbiturates in chemical structure, but has a five membered ring. The chemical name is sodium 5,5-diphenyl-2,4 imidazolidinedione, having the following structural formula:</p><p>Each 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule for oral administration contains 100 mg phenytoin sodium, USP. Also contains lactitol monohydrate, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc and magnesium stearate.  The capsule shell contains gelatin, and black printing ink, which contains black iron oxide, FD&amp;C Blue No. 2, FD&amp;C Red No. 40, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10, shellac glaze and SDA 3A alcohol or N-butyl alcohol and propylene glycol. Product in vivo performance is characterized by a slow and extended rate of absorption with peak blood concentrations expected in 4 to 12 hours as contrasted to Prompt Phenytoin Sodium Capsules, USP with a rapid rate of absorption with peak blood concentration expected in 1½ to 3 hours.</p><h2>Phenytoin Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5–7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5–7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion.</p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Age: Geriatric Population:</span></p><p>Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20-30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Sex/Race:</span></p><p>Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal or Hepatic Impairment:</span></p><p>Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span>:</p><p>It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
