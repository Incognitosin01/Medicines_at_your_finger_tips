Tell your healthcare provider if you have any vision changes or eye problems during your treatment.</p><p>Even if your vision seems fine, it is important that you get your eyes checked during treatment with Blenrep because some changes can happen without symptoms and may only be seen on an eye exam.</p><p>You should use preservative-free lubricant eye drops at least 4 times per day during treatment with Blenrep as instructed by your healthcare provider.
