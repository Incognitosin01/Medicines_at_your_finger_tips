<li>in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, including extended prophylaxis;</li>
<li>in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery;</li>
<li>in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery;</li>
<li>in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are at risk for thromboembolic complications.</li>
</ul><h3>Treatment of Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Fondaparinux Sodium injection is indicated for the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium.</p><h3>Treatment of Acute Pulmonary Embolism</h3><p class="First">Fondaparinux Sodium injection is indicated for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism when administered in conjunction with warfarin sodium when initial therapy is administered in the hospital.</p><h2>Fondaparinux Sodium Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">Do not mix other medications or solutions with Fondaparinux Sodium injection. Administer Fondaparinux Sodium injection only subcutaneously. Discard unused portion.</p><h3>Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis Following Hip Fracture, Hip Replacement, and Knee Replacement Surgery</h3><p class="First">In patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery, the recommended dose of Fondaparinux Sodium injection is 2.5 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once daily after hemostasis has been established. Administer the initial dose no earlier than 6 to 8 hours after surgery. Administration of Fondaparinux Sodium injection earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases the risk of major bleeding. The usual duration of therapy is 5 to 9 days; up to 11 days of therapy was administered in clinical trials.</p><p>In patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, an extended prophylaxis course of up to 24 additional days is recommended. In patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, a total of 32 days (peri-operative and extended prophylaxis) was administered in clinical trials. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Studies (14).]</span></p><h3>Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis Following Abdominal Surgery</h3><p class="First">In patients undergoing abdominal surgery, the recommended dose of Fondaparinux Sodium injection is 2.5 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once daily after hemostasis has been established. Administer the initial dose no earlier than 6 to 8 hours after surgery. Administration of Fondaparinux Sodium injection earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases the risk of major bleeding. The usual duration of administration is 5 to 9 days, and up to 10 days of Fondaparinux Sodium injection was administered in clinical trials.</p><h3>Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Treatment</h3><p class="First">In patients with acute symptomatic DVT and in patients with acute symptomatic PE, the recommended dose of Fondaparinux Sodium injection is 5 mg (body weight &lt;50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 to 100 kg), or 10 mg (body weight &gt;100 kg) by subcutaneous injection once daily (Fondaparinux Sodium treatment regimen). Initiate concomitant treatment with warfarin sodium as soon as possible, usually within 72 hours. Continue treatment with Fondaparinux Sodium injection for at least 5 days and until a therapeutic oral anticoagulant effect is established (INR 2 to 3). The usual duration of administration of Fondaparinux Sodium injection is 5 to 9 days; up to 26 days of Fondaparinux Sodium injection was administered in clinical trials. <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Studies (14).]</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, based upon single-dose pharmacokinetic data. Pharmacokinetic data are not available for patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic impairment may be particularly vulnerable to bleeding during Fondaparinux Sodium therapy. Observe these patients closely for signs and symptoms of bleeding. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.4).]</span></p><h3>Instructions for Use</h3><p class="First">Fondaparinux Sodium injection is provided in a single-dose, prefilled syringe affixed with an automatic needle protection system. Fondaparinux Sodium injection is administered by subcutaneous injection. It must not be administered by intramuscular injection. Fondaparinux Sodium injection is intended for use under a physician’s guidance. Patients may self-inject only if their physician determines that it is appropriate and the patients are trained in subcutaneous injection techniques.</p><p>Prior to administration, visually inspect Fondaparinux Sodium injection to ensure the solution is clear and free of particulate matter.</p><p><span class="Bold">To avoid the loss of drug when using the prefilled syringe, do not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection.</span> Administration should be made in the fatty tissue, alternating injection sites (e.g., between the left and right anterolateral or the left and right posterolateral abdominal wall).</p><p class="First">To administer Fondaparinux Sodium injection:</p><p>NOTE: The safety system can only be activated once the syringe has been emptied. Activation of the safety system must be done only after removing the needle from the patient's skin. Do not replace the needle shield after injection. The safety system should not be sterilized. Activation of the safety system may cause minimal splatter of fluid. For optimal safety activate the system while orienting it downwards away from yourself and others.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Single-dose, prefilled syringes containing either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, or 10 mg of Fondaparinux Sodium. (3)</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Fondaparinux Sodium injection is contraindicated in the following conditions:(4)</p><ul>
<li>Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] &lt;30 mL/min). <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6).]</span></li>
<li>Active major bleeding.</li>
<li>Bacterial endocarditis.</li>
<li>Thrombocytopenia associated with a positive in vitro test for anti-platelet antibody in the presence of Fondaparinux Sodium.</li>
<li>Body weight &lt;50 kg (venous thromboembolism [VTE] prophylaxis only) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></li>
<li>History of serious hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., angioedema, anaphylactoid/ anaphylactic reactions) to Fondaparinux Sodium injection.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Neuraxial Anesthesia and Post-operative Indwelling Epidural Catheter Use</h3><p class="First">Spinal or epidural hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis, can occur with the use of anticoagulants and neuraxial (spinal/epidural) anesthesia or spinal puncture. The risk of these events may be higher with post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or concomitant use of other drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs [see Boxed Warning]. In the postmarketing experience, epidural or spinal hematoma has been reported in association with the use of Fondaparinux Sodium by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Optimal timing between the administration of Fondaparinux Sodium and neuraxial procedures is not known. Monitor patients undergoing these procedures for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Consider the potential risks and benefits before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or who may be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.</p><h3>Hemorrhage</h3><p class="First">Fondaparinux Sodium increases the risk of hemorrhage in patients at risk for bleeding, including conditions such as congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery. Cases of elevated aPTT temporally associated with bleeding events have been reported following administration of Fondaparinux Sodium (with or without concomitant administration of other anticoagulants) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.5)</span>].<br/>
Do not administer agents that enhance the risk of hemorrhage with Fondaparinux Sodium unless essential for the management of the underlying condition, such as vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of VTE. If co-administration is essential, closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding.<br/>
Do not administer the initial dose of Fondaparinux Sodium earlier than 6 to 8 hours after surgery. Administration earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases risk of major bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment and Bleeding Risk</h3><p class="First">Fondaparinux Sodium increases the risk of bleeding in patients with impaired renal function due to reduced clearance <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]</span>.<br/>
The incidence of major bleeding by renal function status reported in clinical trials of patients receiving Fondaparinux Sodium for VTE surgical prophylaxis is provided in Table 1. In these patient populations, the following is recommended:<br/>
In patients who weigh less than 50 kg:</p><ul>
<li>Do not use Fondaparinux Sodium for VTE prophylaxis and treatment in patients with CrCl &lt;30 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</li>
<li>Fondaparinux Sodium may cause prolonged anticoagulation in patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min.</li>
</ul><p class="First Footnote">CrCl = creatinine clearance.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Hip fracture, hip replacement, and knee replacement surgery prophylaxis.</p><p>   Assess renal function periodically in patients receiving Fondaparinux Sodium. Discontinue the drug immediately in patients who develop severe renal impairment while on therapy. After discontinuation of Fondaparinux Sodium, its anticoagulant effects may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function (i.e., at least 3 to 5 half-lives). The anticoagulant effects of Fondaparinux Sodium may persist even longer in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Body Weight &lt;50 Kg and Bleeding Risk</h3><p class="First">Fondaparinux Sodium increases the risk for bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, compared to patients with higher weights.<br/>
In patients who weigh less than 50 kg:</p><ul>
<li>Do not administer Fondaparinux Sodium as prophylactic therapy for patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery [see Contraindications (4)].</li>
</ul><p>During the randomized clinical trials of VTE prophylaxis in the peri-operative period following hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery, major bleeding occurred at a higher rate among patients with a body weight &lt;50 kg compared to those with a body weight &gt;50 kg (5.4% versus 2.1% in patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery; 5.3% versus 3.3% in patients undergoing abdominal surgery).</p><h3>Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of Fondaparinux Sodium. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. Discontinue Fondaparinux Sodium if the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3. Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 3.0% in patients given Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg in the peri-operative hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery clinical trials. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 0.2% in patients given Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg in these clinical trials. During extended prophylaxis, no cases of moderate or severe thrombocytopenia were reported.<br/>
Moderate thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.5% in patients given the Fondaparinux Sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.04% in patients given the Fondaparinux Sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials.<br/>
Isolated occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia have been reported with the use of Fondaparinux Sodium in postmarketing experience. [See Adverse Reactions (6.5).]</p><h3>Monitoring: Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of the activity of Fondaparinux Sodium and international standards of heparin or LMWH are not calibrators to measure anti-Factor Xa activity of Fondaparinux Sodium. If unexpected changes in coagulation parameters or major bleeding occur during therapy with Fondaparinux Sodium, discontinue Fondaparinux Sodium. In postmarketing experience, isolated occurrences of aPTT elevations have been reported following administration of Fondaparinux Sodium <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.5)].</span></p><p>Periodic routine complete blood counts (including platelet count), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with Fondaparinux Sodium.</p><p>The anti-Factor Xa activity of Fondaparinux Sodium can be measured by anti-Xa assay using the appropriate calibrator (fondaparinux). The activity of Fondaparinux Sodium is expressed in milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux and cannot be compared with activities of heparin or low molecular weight heparins. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3).]</span></p><h3>Latex</h3><p class="First">The packaging (needle guard) of the prefilled syringe of Fondaparinux Sodium injection contains dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>

The rates of major bleeding events reported during 3 active-controlled peri-operative VTE prophylaxis trials with enoxaparin sodium in hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery (N = 3,616) and in an extended VTE prophylaxis trial (n =327) with Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg are provided in Table 2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hip Fracture, Hip Replacement, and Knee Replacement Surgery:</span> The rates of major bleeding events reported during the hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery clinical trials with Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg are provided in Table 2.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Enoxaparin sodium dosing regimen: 30 mg every 12 hours or 40 mg once daily.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">b</span> Not approved for use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">c</span> Major bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was (1) fatal, (2) bleeding at critical site (e.g. intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, pericardial, spinal, or into adrenal gland), (3) associated with re-operation at operative site, or (4) with a bleeding index (BI) ≥2.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">d</span> BI ≥2: Overt bleeding associated only with a bleeding index (BI) ≥2 calculated as [number of whole blood or packed red blood cell units transfused + [(pre-bleeding) – (post-bleeding)] hemoglobin (g/dL) values].</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">e</span> Minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was not major.</p><p>A separate analysis of major bleeding across all randomized, controlled, peri-operative, prophylaxis clinical studies of hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery according to the time of the first injection of Fondaparinux Sodium after surgical closure was performed in patients who received Fondaparinux Sodium only post-operatively. In this analysis, the incidences of major bleeding were as follows: &lt;4 hours was 4.8% (5/104), 4 to 6 hours was 2.3% (28/1,196), 6 to 8 hours was 1.9% (38/1,965).

These elevations are reversible and may be associated with increases in bilirubin. In the extended prophylaxis clinical trial, no significant differences in AST and ALT levels between Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg and placebo-treated patients were observed.</p><p>In the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials, asymptomatic increases in AST and ALT levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal of the laboratory reference range were reported in 0.7% and 1.3% of patients, respectively, during treatment with Fondaparinux Sodium.

Inhibition of the other isozymes evaluated (CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and 3E1) was 0 to 16%. Since fondaparinux does not markedly inhibit CYP450s (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4) in vitro, Fondaparinux Sodium is not expected to significantly interact with other drugs in vivo by inhibition of metabolism mediated by these isozymes.</p><p>Since Fondaparinux Sodium does not bind significantly to plasma proteins other than ATIII, no drug interactions by protein-binding displacement are expected.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span><br/>
Available data from published literature and postmarketing reports have not reported a clear association with Fondaparinux Sodium and adverse development outcomes. Fondaparinux Sodium plasma concentrations obtained from four women treated with Fondaparinux Sodium during pregnancy and their newborn infants demonstrated low placental transfer of Fondaparinux Sodium <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. There are risk to the mother associated with untreated venous thromboembolism in pregnancy and a risk of hemorrhage in the mother and fetus associated with use of anticoagulants <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Consideration)</span>.

All patients receiving anticoagulants, including pregnant women, are at risk for bleeding.<br/>
Fondaparinux Sodium use during labor or delivery in women who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia may result in epidural or spinal hematomas. Pregnant women receiving Fondaparinux Sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or unexpected changes in coagulation parameters. Consideration for use of a shorter acting anticoagulant should be specification addressed as delivery approached [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.6)].</p><p>Data</p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span><br/>
In a study of five pregnant women treated with Fondaparinux Sodium during the third trimester of pregnancy at a dose of 2.5 mg/day, four of the women had elevated anti-factor Xa activity noted in the cord blood. Anti- factor Xa clotting times in these four cases were between 37.5 and 50.9 seconds. The patient who did not have elevated anti- factor Xa activity had receied only one dose of Fondaparinux Sodium 22 hours prior to delivery. The concentration of Fondaparinux Sodium in umbilical cord plasma was approximately 1/10th the level of Fondaparinux Sodium maternal plasma. None of the infants experienced adverse effects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
Embryo-fetal development studies have been conducted with Fondaparinux Sodium in pregnant rats at subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (about 32 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) administered from days 6 to 17 of gestation and pregnant rabbits at subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (about 65 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) administered from days 6 to 18 of gestation. These studies have revealed no evidence of adverse development outcomes when Fondaparinux Sodium was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Additionally, there were no effects on pre and postnatal development in a study conducted in rats at subcutaneous dose up to 10 mg/kg/day (about 32 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area)</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span><br/>
There are no data on the presence of Fondaparinux Sodium in human milk, or the effects on milk production. Limited clinical data during lactation preclude a clear determination of the risk of Fondaparinux Sodium to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with mother’s clinical need for Fondaparinux Sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Fondaparinux Sodium or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Fondaparinux Sodium in pediatric patients have not been established. Because risk for bleeding during treatment with Fondaparinux Sodium is increased in adults who weigh &lt;50 kg, bleeding may be a particular safety concern for use of Fondaparinux Sodium in the pediatric population <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials the efficacy of Fondaparinux Sodium in the elderly (65 years or older) was similar to that seen in patients younger than 65 years; however, serious adverse events increased with age. When using Fondaparinux Sodium in elderly patients, paying particular attention to dosing directions and concomitant medications (especially anti-platelet medication). <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).]</span></p><p>Fondaparinux Sodium is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to Fondaparinux Sodium may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, assess renal function prior to Fondaparinux Sodium administration. <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4).]</span></p><p>In the peri-operative hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery clinical trials with patients receiving Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg, serious adverse events increased with age for patients receiving Fondaparinux Sodium. The incidence of major bleeding in clinical trials of Fondaparinux Sodium by age is provided in Table 6.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Includes hip fracture, hip replacement, and knee replacement surgery prophylaxis.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with impaired renal function are at increased risk of bleeding due to reduced clearance of Fondaparinux Sodium <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span> Assess renal function periodically in patients receiving Fondaparinux Sodium . Discontinue Fondaparinux Sodium immediately in patients who develop severe renal impairment while on therapy. After discontinuation of Fondaparinux Sodium , its anticoagulant effects may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function (i.e., at least 3 to 5 half-lives). The anticoagulant effects of Fondaparinux Sodium may persist even longer in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Following a single, subcutaneous dose of 7.5 mg of Fondaparinux Sodium in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category B) compared to subjects with normal liver function, changes from baseline in aPTT, PT/INR, and antithrombin III were similar in the two groups. However, a higher incidence of hemorrhage was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in normal subjects, especially mild hematomas at the blood sampling or injection site. The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.4).]</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no known antidote for Fondaparinux Sodium. Overdose of Fondaparinux Sodium may lead to hemorrhagic complications. Discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate therapy if bleeding complications associated with overdosage occur.</p><p>Data obtained in patients undergoing chronic intermittent hemodialysis suggest that clearance of Fondaparinux Sodium can increase by 20% during hemodialysis.</p><h2>Fondaparinux Sodium Description</h2><p class="First">Fondaparinux Sodium Injection USP is a sterile solution containing Fondaparinux Sodium. It is a synthetic and specific inhibitor of activated Factor X (Xa). Fondaparinux Sodium is methyl O-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-β-D-glucopyra-nuronosyl-(1→4)-O-2-deoxy-3,6-di-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-2-O-sulfo-α-L-idopyranuronosyl-(1→4)-2-deoxy-6-O-sulfo-2-(sulfoamino)-α-D-glucopyranoside, decasodium salt.</p><p>The molecular formula of Fondaparinux Sodium is C31H43N3Na10O49S8 and its molecular weight is 1728. The structural formula is provided below:</p><p></p><p>Fondaparinux Sodium is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free injectable solution for subcutaneous use.</p><p>Each single-dose, prefilled syringe of Fondaparinux Sodium, affixed with an automatic needle protection system, contains 2.5 mg of Fondaparinux Sodium in 0.5 mL, 5.0 mg of Fondaparinux Sodium in 0.4 mL, 7.5 mg of Fondaparinux Sodium in 0.6 mL, or 10.0 mg of Fondaparinux Sodium in 0.8 mL of an isotonic solution of sodium chloride and water for injection. May also contain sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid as pH adjusters.  The final drug product is a clear and colorless to slightly yellow liquid with a pH between 5.0 and 8.0.</p><h2>Fondaparinux Sodium - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The antithrombotic activity of Fondaparinux Sodium is the result of antithrombin III (ATIII)-mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa. By selectively binding to ATIII, Fondaparinux Sodium potentiates (about 300 times) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII. Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development.</p><p>Fondaparinux Sodium does not inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II) and has no known effect on platelet function. At the recommended dose, Fondaparinux Sodium does not affect fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Anti-Xa Activity:</span> The pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics of Fondaparinux Sodium are derived from fondaparinux plasma concentrations quantified via anti-Factor Xa activity. Only fondaparinux can be used to calibrate the anti-Xa assay. (The international standards of heparin or LMWH are not appropriate for this use.) As a result, the activity of Fondaparinux Sodium is expressed as milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux calibrator. The anti-Xa activity of the drug increases with increasing drug concentration, reaching maximum values in approximately three hours.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span> Fondaparinux Sodium administered by subcutaneous injection is rapidly and completely absorbed (absolute bioavailability is 100%). Following a single subcutaneous dose of Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg in young male subjects, Cmax of 0.34 mg/L is reached in approximately 2 hours. In patients undergoing treatment with Fondaparinux Sodium injection 2.5 mg, once daily, the peak steady-state plasma concentration is, on average, 0.39 to 0.50 mg/L and is reached approximately 3 hours post-dose. In these patients, the minimum steady-state plasma concentration is 0.14 to 0.19 mg/L. In patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism undergoing treatment with Fondaparinux Sodium injection 5 mg (body weight &lt;50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 to 100 kg), and 10 mg (body weight &gt;100 kg) once daily, the body–weight-adjusted doses provide similar mean steady-state peaks and minimum plasma concentrations across all body weight categories. The mean peak steady-state plasma concentration is in the range of 1.20 to 1.26 mg/L. In these patients, the mean minimum steady-state plasma concentration is in the range of 0.46 to 0.62 mg/L.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> In healthy adults, intravenously or subcutaneously administered Fondaparinux Sodium distributes mainly in blood and only to a minor extent in extravascular fluid as evidenced by steady state and non-steady state apparent volume of distribution of 7 to 11 L. Similar fondaparinux distribution occurs in patients undergoing elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery. In vitro, Fondaparinux Sodium is highly (at least 94%) and specifically bound to antithrombin III (ATIII) and does not bind significantly to other plasma proteins (including platelet Factor 4 [PF4]) or red blood cells.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span> In vivo metabolism of fondaparinux has not been investigated since the majority of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in urine in individuals with normal kidney function.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination:</span> In individuals with normal kidney function, fondaparinux is eliminated in urine mainly as unchanged drug. In healthy individuals up to 75 years of age, up to 77% of a single subcutaneous or intravenous fondaparinux dose is eliminated in urine as unchanged drug in 72 hours. The elimination half-life is 17 to 21 hours.</p><h3>Special Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment:</span> Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients with renal impairment since the major route of elimination is urinary excretion of unchanged drug. In patients undergoing prophylaxis following elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery, the total clearance of fondaparinux is approximately 25% lower in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50 to 80 mL/min), approximately 40% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min), and approximately 55% lower in patients with severe renal impairment (&lt;30 mL/min) compared to patients with normal renal function. A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and extent of renal impairment was observed in DVT treatment patients. <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3).]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment:</span> Following a single, subcutaneous dose of 7.5 mg of Fondaparinux Sodium in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category B), C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were decreased by 22% and 39%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal liver function. The changes from baseline in pharmacodynamic parameters, such as aPTT, PT/INR, and antithrombin III, were similar in normal subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Based on these data, no dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. However, a higher incidence of hemorrhage was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in normal subjects <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>. The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.5).]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric:</span> The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux have not been investigated in pediatric patients. <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Pediatric Use (8.4).]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric:</span> Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients older than 75 years. In studies evaluating Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg prophylaxis in hip fracture surgery or elective hip surgery, the total clearance of fondaparinux was approximately 25% lower in patients older than 75 years as compared to patients younger than 65 years. A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and age was observed in DVT treatment patients. <span class="Italics">[See Use in Specific Populations (8.5).]</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients Weighing Less Than 50 kg:</span> Total clearance of Fondaparinux Sodium is decreased by approximately 30% in patients weighing less than 50 kg <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gender:</span> The pharmacokinetic properties of Fondaparinux Sodium are not significantly affected by gender.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Race:</span> Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied prospectively. However, studies performed in Asian (Japanese) healthy subjects did not reveal a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to Caucasian healthy subjects. Similarly, no plasma clearance differences were observed between black and Caucasian patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Fondaparinux Sodium.</p><p>Fondaparinux Sodium was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test, or the rat micronucleus test.</p><p>At subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (about 32 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), Fondaparinux Sodium was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Prophylaxis of Thromboembolic Events Following Hip Fracture Surgery</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg SC once daily was compared to enoxaparin sodium 40 mg SC once daily, which is not approved for use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
