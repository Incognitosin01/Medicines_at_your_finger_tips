The chemical name is (-)-17-(cyclobutylmethyl)morphinan-3,14-diol[S-(R*,R*)]-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1:1) (salt). The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">21</span>H<span class="Sub">29</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span>•C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 477.55 g/mol and the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>Butorphanol tartrate is a white crystalline substance. The dose is expressed as the tartrate salt. One milligram of the salt is equivalent to 0.68 mg of the free base. The n-octanol/aqueous buffer partition coefficient of butorphanol is 180:1 at pH 7.5.</p><p>Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, USP is an aqueous solution of butorphanol tartrate for administration as a metered spray to the nasal mucosa. Each bottle of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, USP contains 2.5 mL of a 10 mg/mL solution of butorphanol tartrate with sodium chloride, citric acid, and benzethonium chloride in purified water with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid added to adjust the pH to 5.0. The pump reservoir must be fully primed [see PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS] prior to initial use. After initial priming each metered spray delivers an average of 1.0 mg of butorphanol tartrate and the 2.5 mL bottle will deliver an average of 14 to 15 doses of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, USP. If not used for 48 hours or longer, the unit must be reprimed [see PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS]. With intermittent use requiring repriming before each dose, the 2.5 mL bottle will deliver an average of 8 to 10 doses of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, USP depending on how much repriming is necessary.</p><p class="Center"> </p><h2>Butorphanol Nasal Spray - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Butorphanol is a partial opioid agonist at the mu opioid receptor and a full agonist at the kappa opioid receptor. The principal therapeutic action of butorphanol is analgesia. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The analgesic effect of butorphanol is influenced by the route of administration. Onset of analgesia is within 15 minutes for the nasal administration doses. Peak analgesic activity occurs within 1 to 2 hours following nasal spray administration.</p><p>The duration of analgesia varies depending on the pain model as well as the route of administration. Compared to the injectable form and other drugs in this class, butorphanol tartrate nasal spray has a longer duration of action (4 to 5 hours) [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Clinical Trials).</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Butorphanol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>In human studies involving individuals without significant respiratory dysfunction, 2 mg of butorphanol IV and 10 mg of morphine sulfate IV depressed respiration to a comparable degree. At higher doses, the magnitude of respiratory depression with butorphanol is not appreciably increased; however, the duration of respiratory depression is longer. Respiratory depression noted after administration of butorphanol to humans by any route is reversed by treatment with naloxone, a specific opioid antagonist [see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>].</p><p>Butorphanol, like other mixed agonist-antagonists with a high affinity for the κ-receptor, may produce unpleasant psychotomimetic effects in some individuals.</p><p>Nausea and/or vomiting may be produced by doses of 1 mg or more administered by any route.</p><p>In human studies of butorphanol [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY; Clinical Trials), sedation is commonly noted at doses of 0.5 mg or more. Narcosis is produced by 10 to 12 mg doses of butorphanol administered over 10 to 15 minutes intravenously.</p><p>Butorphanol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Butorphanol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Hemodynamic changes noted during cardiac catheterization in patients receiving single 0.025 mg/kg intravenous doses of butorphanol have included increases in pulmonary artery pressure, wedge pressure and vascular resistance, increases in left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and in systemic arterial pressure.</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Concentration–Efficacy Relationships</span></p><p>The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of butorphanol for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing butorphanol plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>].</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">After nasal administration, mean peak blood levels of 0.9 to 1.04 ng/mL occur at 30 to 60 minutes after a 1 mg dose (see <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>). The absolute bioavailability of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is 60 to 70% and is unchanged in patients with allergic rhinitis. In patients using a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline) the fraction of the dose absorbed was unchanged, but the rate of absorption was slowed. The peak plasma concentrations were approximately half those achieved in the absence of the vasoconstrictor.</p><p>Following its initial absorption/distribution phase, the single dose pharmacokinetics of butorphanol by the intravenous, intramuscular, and nasal routes of administration are similar (see <span class="Bold">Figure 1</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Butorphanol Plasma Levels After IV, IM and Nasal Spray Administration of 2 mg Dose</span></span></p><p></p><p>Serum protein binding is independent of concentration over the range achieved in clinical practice (up to 7 ng/mL) with a bound fraction of approximately 80%.</p><p>The volume of distribution of butorphanol varies from 305 to 901 liters and total body clearance from 52 to 154 liters/hr (see <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>).</p><p><span class="Sup">1.</span> Young subjects (n=24) are from 20 to 40 years old and elderly (n=24) are greater than 65 years of age.</p><p><span class="Sup">2.</span> Time to peak plasma concentration.</p><p><span class="Sup">3.</span> Mean (1 S.D.)</p><p><span class="Sup">4.</span> (range of observed values)</p><p><span class="Sup">5.</span> Peak plasma concentration normalized to 1 mg dose.</p><p><span class="Sup">6.</span> Area under the plasma concentration-time curve after a 1 mg dose.</p><p><span class="Sup">7.</span> Derived from IV data.</p><p>Dose proportionality for butorphanol tartrate nasal spray has been determined at steady state in doses up to 4 mg at 6-hour intervals. Steady state is achieved within 2 days. The mean peak plasma concentration at steady state was 1.8-fold (maximal 3-fold) following a single dose.</p><p>The drug is transported across the blood brain and placental barriers and into human milk [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: Labor and Delivery</span> and <span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span>].</p><p>Butorphanol is extensively metabolized in the liver. Metabolism is qualitatively and quantitatively similar following intravenous, intramuscular, or nasal administration. Oral bioavailability is only 5 to 17% because of extensive first pass metabolism of butorphanol.</p><p>The major metabolite of butorphanol is hydroxybutorphanol, while norbutorphanol is produced in small amounts. Both have been detected in plasma following administration of butorphanol, with norbutorphanol present at trace levels at most time points. The elimination half-life of hydroxybutorphanol is about 18 hours and, as a consequence, considerable accumulation (~5-fold) occurs when butorphanol is dosed to steady state (1 mg transnasally q6h for 5 days).</p><p>Elimination occurs by urine and fecal excretion. When <span class="Sup">3</span>H labelled butorphanol is administered to normal subjects, most (70 to 80%) of the dose is recovered in the urine, while approximately 15% is recovered in the feces.</p><p>About 5% of the dose is recovered in the urine as butorphanol. Forty-nine percent is eliminated in the urine as hydroxybutorphanol. Less than 5% is excreted in the urine as norbutorphanol.</p><p>Butorphanol pharmacokinetics in the elderly differ from younger patients (see <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>). The mean absolute bioavailability of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in elderly women (48%) was less than that in elderly men (75%), young men (68%), or young women (70%). Elimination half-life is increased in the elderly (6.6 hours as opposed to 4.7 hours in younger subjects).</p><p>In renally impaired patients with creatinine clearances &lt;30 mL/min, the elimination half-life was approximately doubled, and the total body clearance was approximately one half (10.5 hours [clearance 150 L/h] as compared to 5.8 hours [clearance 260 L/h] in healthy subjects). No effect on C<span class="Sub">max</span> or T<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed after a single dose.</p><p>After intravenous administration to patients with hepatic impairment, the elimination half-life of butorphanol was approximately tripled and total body clearance was approximately one half (half-life 16.8 hours, clearance 92 L/h) compared to healthy subjects (half-life 4.8 hours, clearance 175 L/h). The exposure of hepatically impaired patients to butorphanol was significantly greater (about 2-fold) than that in healthy subjects. Similar results were seen after nasal administration. No effect on C<span class="Sub">max</span> or T<span class="Sub">max</span> was observed after a single intranasal dose.</p><p>For further recommendations refer to PRECAUTIONS: Hepatic and Renal Disease, Drug Interactions, and Geriatric Use sections and to the <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> section below<span class="Bold">.</span></p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sumatriptan</span></p><p>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg dose of butorphanol administered as butorphanol tartrate nasal spray were not affected by the coadministration of a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan. However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of butorphanol were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decreases in C<span class="Sub">max</span>) when a 1 mg dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray was administered 1 minute after a 20 mg dose of sumatriptan nasal spray. (The two drugs were administered in opposite nostrils.) When the butorphanol tartrate nasal spray was administered 30 minutes after the sumatriptan nasal spray, the AUC of butorphanol increased 11% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> decreased 18%.</p><p>In neither case were the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan affected by coadministration with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray. These results suggest that the analgesic effect of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray may be diminished when it is administered shortly after sumatriptan nasal spray, but by 30 minutes any such reduction in effect should be minimal.</p><p>The safety of usingbutorphanol tartrate nasal spray and IMITREX<span class="Sup">®1</span> (sumatriptan) nasal spray during the same episode of migrane has not been established. However, it should be noted that both products are capable of producing transient increases in blood pressure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cimetidine</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg dose of butorphanol administered as butorphanol tartrate nasal spray were not affected by the coadministration of cimetidine (300 mg QID). Conversely, the administration of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray (1 mg butorphanol QID) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a 300 mg dose of cimetidine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Oxymetazoline</span></p><p>The fraction of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray absorbed is unaffected by the concomitant administration of a nasal vasoconstrictor (oxymetazoline), but the rate of absorption is decreased. Therefore, a slower onset can be anticipated if butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is administered concomitantly with, or immediately following, a nasal vasoconstrictor.</p><h3>Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First"><span class="None">The effectiveness of opioid analgesics varies in different pain syndromes.</span></p><p>Studies with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray have been performed in postoperative (general, orthopedic, oral, cesarean section) pain, in postepisiotomy pain, in pain of musculoskeletal origin, and in migraine headache pain (see below). </p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Postoperative Pain:</span>  The analgesic efficacy of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray was evaluated (approximately 35 patients per treatment group) in a general and orthopedic surgery trial. Single doses of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray (1 or 2 mg) and IM meperidine (37.5 or 75 mg) were compared. Analgesia provided by 1 and 2 mg doses of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray was similar to 37.5 and 75 mg meperidine, respectively, with onset of analgesia within 15 minutes and peak analgesic effect within 1 hour. The median duration of pain relief was 2.5 hours with 1 mg butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, 3.5 hours with 2 mg butorphanol tartrate nasal spray and 3.3 hours with either dose of meperidine.</p><p>In a postcesarean section trial, butorphanol tartrate nasal spray administered to 35 patients as two 1 mg doses 60 minutes apart was compared with a single 2 mg dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray or a single 2 mg IV dose of butorphanol tartrate injection (37 patients each). Onset of analgesia was within 15 minutes for all butorphanol tartrate regimens. Peak analgesic effects of 2 mg intravenous butorphanol tartrate injection and butorphanol tartrate nasal spray were similar in magnitude. The duration of pain relief provided by both 2 mg butorphanol tartrate nasal spray regimens was approximately 4.5 hours and was greater than intravenous butorphanol tartrate injection (2.6 hours).</p><p><span class="Bold">Migraine Headache Pain:</span>  The analgesic efficacy of two 1 mg doses 1 hour apart of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in migraine headache pain was compared with a single dose of 10 mg IM methadone (31 and 32 patients, respectively). Significant onset of analgesia occurred within 15 minutes for both butorphanol tartrate nasal spray and IM methadone. Peak analgesic effect occurred at 2 hours for butorphanol tartrate nasal spray and 1.5 hours for methadone. The median duration of pain relief was 6 hours with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray and 4 hours with methadone as judged by the time when approximately half of the patients remedicated.</p><p>In two other trials in patients with migraine headache pain, a 2 mg initial dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray followed by an additional 1 mg dose 1 hour later (76 patients) was compared with either 75 mg IM meperidine (24 patients) or placebo (72 patients). Onset, peak activity and duration were similar with both active treatments; however, the incidence of adverse experiences (nausea, vomiting, dizziness) was higher in these two trials with the 2 mg initial dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray than in the trial with the 1 mg initial dose.</p><h3>Individualization of Dosage</h3><p class="First">Use of butorphanol in geriatric patients, patients with renal impairment, patients with hepatic impairment, and during labor requires extra caution (<span class="Italics">see</span> below and the appropriate sections in PRECAUTIONS).</p><p>The usual recommended dose for initial nasal administration is 1 mg (1 spray in one nostril). If adequate pain relief is not achieved within 60 to 90 minutes, an additional 1-mg dose may be given.</p><p>The initial dose sequence outlined above may be repeated in 3 to 4 hours as required after the second dose of the sequence.</p><p>For the management of severe pain, an initial dose of 2 mg (1 spray in each nostril) may be used in patients who will be able to remain recumbent in the event drowsiness or dizziness occurs. In such patients additional doses should not be given for 3 to 4 hours. The incidence of adverse events is higher with an initial 2-mg dose (<span class="Italics">see</span> Clinical Trials).</p><p>The initial dose sequence in elderly patients and patients with renal or hepatic impairment should be limited to 1 mg followed, if needed, by 1 mg in 90 to 120 minutes. The repeat dose sequence in these patients should be determined by the patient’s response rather than at fixed times but will generally be no less than at 6-hour intervals (<span class="Italics">see</span> PRECAUTIONS).</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Butorphanol Nasal Spray</h2><p class="First">Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span><br/>
Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, even at recommended doses [see WARNINGS], reserve butorphanol tartrate nasal spray for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics]</p><ul>
<li>Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated,</li>
<li>Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is contraindicated in:</p><ul>
<li>Patients with significant respiratory depression [see <span class="Bold"></span>WARNINGS]</li>
<li>Patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment [see WARNINGS]</li>
<li>Patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [see WARNINGS]</li>
<li>Patients with hypersensitivity to butorphanol tartrate, the preservative benzethonium chloride, or any of the formulation excipients (e.g., anaphylaxis) [see WARNINGS])</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</span></p><p>Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray contains butorphanol, a Schedule IV controlled substance. As an opioid, butorphanol tartrate nasal spray exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE].</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed butorphanol tartrate nasal spray. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, and monitor all patients receiving butorphanol tartrate nasal spray for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose (see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose).</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing butorphanol tartrate nasal spray. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><p><span class="Bold">Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</p><ul>
<li>Complete a <span class="Bold">REMS-compliant education program</span> offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</li>
<li>Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The <span class="Bold">Patient Counseling Guide (PCG)</span> can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.</li>
<li>Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.</li>
<li>Consider. using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.

</ul><p><span class="Bold">Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</span></p><p>Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see OVERDOSAGE]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of butorphanol.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray are essential [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Overestimating the butorphanol tartrate nasal spray dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental exposure to even one dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of butorphanol.</p><p>Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients).</p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].</p><p><span class="Bold">Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose</span> </p><p>Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered (see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients). </p><p>Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of other CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone (see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients).</p><p><span class="Bold">Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</span></p><p>Prolonged use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients, Pregnancy].</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</span></p><p>Concomitant use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of butorphanol and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in butorphanol tartrate nasal spray -treated patients may increase butorphanol plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using butorphanol tartrate nasal spray with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in butorphanol tartrate nasal spray-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray until stable drug effects are achieved [See PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].</p><p>Concomitant use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease butorphanol plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to butorphanol. When using butorphanol tartrate nasal spray with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</span></p><p>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose (see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose).</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients, Drug Interactions].</p><p><span class="Bold">Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span></p><p>The use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease</span><br/>
Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray -treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray [see WARNINGS].</p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachetic, or Debilitated Patients</span><br/>
Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see WARNINGS].</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating butorphanol tartrate nasal spray and when butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see WARNINGS]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adrenal Insufficiency</span></p><p>Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</span></p><p>In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), butorphanol tartrate nasal spray may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</span></p><p>Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>Butorphanol in butorphanol tartrate nasal spray may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</span></p><p>The butorphanol in butorphanol tartrate nasal spray may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occuring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during butorphanol tartrate nasal spray.</p><p><span class="Bold">Withdrawal</span></p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration, Drug Abuse and Dependence].</p><p>Additionally, the use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, a mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesic, in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid concomitant use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray with a full opioid agonist analgesic.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Effects</span></p><p>Because butorphanol may increase the work of the heart, especially the pulmonary circuit, the use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in patients with acute myocardial infarction, ventricular dysfunction, or coronary insufficiency should be limited to those situations where the benefits clearly outweigh the risk [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].</p><p>Severe hypertension has been reported rarely during butorphanol tartrate nasal spray therapy. In such cases, butorphanol tartrate nasal spray should be discontinued and the hypertension treated with antihypertensive drugs. In patients who are not opioid dependent, naloxone has also been reported to be effective.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>Hypotension associated with syncope during the first hour of dosing with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray has been reported rarely, particularly in patients with past history of similar reactions to opioid analgesics.

An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions.

</ul><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Controlled Substance</span></p><p>Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray contains butorphanol, a Schedule IV controlled substance.</p><p><span class="Bold">Abuse</span></p><p>Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray contains butorphanol, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion (see WARNINGS).</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray</span></p><p>Butorphanol tartrate, by all routes of administration, has been associated with episodes of abuse. Of the cases received, there were more reports of abuse with the nasal spray formulation than with the injectable formulation. Abuse of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances.</p><p>Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dependence</span></p><p>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.  </p><p>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine) [see WARNINGS]. Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.  </p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.  </p><p>When discontinuing butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, gradually taper the dosage using a patient specific plan that considers the following: the dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS].</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdose with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>Opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to butorphanol tartrate overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. As butorphanol is a mixed opioid agonist/antagonist, larger doses of naloxone may be needed to reverse the effects of an overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of butorphanol in butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Butorphanol Nasal Spray Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</span></p><p>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS].</p><p>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].</p><p>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray and adjust the dosage accordingly [see WARNINGS].</p><p><span class="Bold">Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose</span> </p><p>Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with butorphanol tartrate nasal spray (see WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients). </p><p>Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing regulations (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). </p><p>Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient (see WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression, Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants). </p><p>Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Initial Dosage</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray as the first Opioid Analgesic</span></p><p>Factors to be considered in determining the dose are age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition, use of other drugs, type of anesthesia to be used, and surgical procedure involved. Use in the elderly and in patients with hepatic or renal disease requires extra caution (<span class="Italics">see</span> PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Individualization of Dosage). The following doses are for patients who do not have impaired hepatic or renal function and who are not on CNS active agents.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Use for Pain:</span> The usual recommended dose for initial nasal administration of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is 1 mg (1 spray in <span class="Bold">one</span> nostril). Adherence to this dose reduces the incidence of drowsiness and dizziness. If adequate pain relief is not achieved within 60 to 90 minutes, an additional 1 mg dose may be given.</p><p>The initial dose sequence outlined above may be repeated in 3 to 4 hours as required <span class="Bold">after the second dose</span> of the sequence.</p><p>Depending on the severity of the pain, an initial dose of 2 mg (1 spray in <span class="Bold">each</span> nostril) may be used in patients who will be able to remain recumbent in the event drowsiness or dizziness occurs. In such patients single additional 2 mg doses should not be given for 3 to 4 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Use in Balanced Anesthesia: </span> The use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is not recommended because it has not been studied in induction or maintenance of anesthesia.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Labor:</span> The use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is not recommended as it has not been studied in labor.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Opioids to Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray</span></p><p>There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour butorphanol tartrate nasal spray dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour butorphanol dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosage Modifications in Elderly Patients and Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The initial dose sequence in elderly patients and patients with hepatic or renal impairment should be limited to 1 mg followed, if needed, by 1 mg in 90 to 120 minutes. The repeat dose sequence should be determined by the patient’s response rather than at fixed times but will generally be no less than at 6 hours intervals [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Individualization of Dosage and PRECAUTIONS].</p><p><span class="Bold">Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</span></p><p>Individually titrate butorphanol tartrate nasal spray to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving butorphanol tartrate nasal spray to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see WARNINGS]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.</p><p>If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the butorphanol tartrate nasal spray dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><p>Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray  </p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.   </p><p>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.  </p><p>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on butorphanol tartrate nasal spray who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with doselowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.  </p><p>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.  </p><p>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see WARNINGS/ Withdrawal, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE].</p><p><span class="Bold">Safety and Handling</span></p><p>Butorphanol tartrate nasal spray is an open delivery system with increased risk of exposure to health care workers.</p><p>In the priming process, a certain amount of butorphanol may be aerosolized; therefore, the pump sprayer should be aimed away from the patient or other people or animals.</p><p>The disposal of Schedule IV controlled substances must be consistent with State and Federal Regulations.
