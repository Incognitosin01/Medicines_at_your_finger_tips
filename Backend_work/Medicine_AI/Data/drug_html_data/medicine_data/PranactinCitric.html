Intended Use</h2><p class="First">The BreathTek™ UBT Collection Kit is intended for use in the qualitative detection of urease associated with <span class="Italics">Helicobacter pylori</span> in the human stomach and as an aid in the initial diagnosis and post-treatment monitoring of <span class="Italics">Helicobacter pylori</span> infection in adult patients. The test may be used for monitoring treatment if used at least four (4) weeks following completion of therapy. For these purposes, the system utilizes an Infrared Spectrophotometer for the measurement of the ratio of <span class="Sup">13</span>CO<span class="Sub">2</span> to <span class="Sup">12</span>CO<span class="Sub">2</span> in breath samples.</p><p>For administration by health care professionals. To be administered under a physician’s supervision.</p><h2>II. Summary and Explanation</h2><p class="First">Since the isolation of the spiral urease-producing <span class="Italics">Helicobacter pylori</span> bacteria <span class="Italics">(H. pylori)</span> in 1983 by Drs. Marshall and Warren<span class="Sup">1</span>, a significant body of evidence has accumulated indicating that the bacteria is an important pathogen in the upper GI tract of humans.<span class="Sup">2.3</span> The causal relationship between <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> and chronic active gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and gastric ulcer is well documented.<span class="Sup">4.5</span> Methods available for detecting current infection of the human stomach by <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> are generally divided into two (2) general types: Invasive and Non-invasive.</p><p>Invasive methods are so named because they include, as a first step, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (“EGD”) with collection of gastric biopsies. These biopsies are then examined by one or more detection methods: histological examination of stained tissue, microbiological culture of the organism, or direct detection of urease activity in the tissue (for example, the CLOtest<span class="Sup">®</span>). Biopsy based methods are expensive, entail some patient risk and discomfort and may give false negative results due to sampling errors when colonization of the gastric mucosa is patchy.<span class="Sup">6</span></p><p>The non-invasive, non-radioactive method for detecting current <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> infection is based on the BreathTek™ UBT which is described in the next section. Several serological tests that detect serum antibodies to <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> are commercially available. A positive result with these tests cannot distinguish between current infection and past exposure to infection and, therefore, is not a conclusive indicator of current gastrointestinal colonization by <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span>.</p><h2>III. Principle of the BreathTek™ UBT for H. pylori</h2><h2>IV. Warnings and Precautions</h2><h2>V. Shelf Life and Storage</h2><p>The BreathTek™ UBT Collection Kit should be stored at 15°-30°C (59°-86°F). Pranactin<span class="Sup">®</span>-Citric has an expiration date. Do not use beyond the expiration date stated on the label.</p><h2>VI. Patient Preparation</h2><h2>VII.

Quality Control</h2><p class="First">Complete operating information, including self-diagnostic instrument routines and user maintenance procedures, is provided in the Instruction Manuals for the UBiT<span class="Sup">®</span>-IR300 Spectrophotometer, the UBiT<span class="Sup">®</span>-AS10 Autosampler and the POCone™ Spectrophotometer, respectively.

Expected Values</h2><p class="First">Delta Over Baseline values for the BreathTek™ UBT were determined in a controlled clinical study of twenty-six (26) infected and twenty-three (23) uninfected adult volunteers. The Meretek UBT<span class="Sup">®</span> Breath Test was used as the reference method in the diagnosis of infection. The range of BreathTek™ UBT Delta Over Baseline values for the uninfected group was determined to be 0.0 to 1.0. A histogram for the distribution of Delta Over Baseline values from the uninfected subjects is shown in Figure 2a.</p><p>Values for the Meretek UBT<span class="Sup">®</span> Breath Test were determined in a controlled clinical study of sixty-six (66) infected and fifty-three (53) uninfected asymptomatic, apparently healthy volunteers. Histological examination of biopsy tissue was used as the reference method in the determination of infection in this study. The range of Meretek UBT<span class="Sup">®</span> Delta Over Baseline values for the uninfected group was determined to be 0.0 to 2.2. A histogram for the distribution of Delta Over Baseline values from the uninfected subjects is shown in Figure 2b.</p><h2>XII. Performance Characteristics</h2><h2>XIII. Bibliography</h2><h2>XIV.
