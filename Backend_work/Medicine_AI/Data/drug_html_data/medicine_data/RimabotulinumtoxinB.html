Botulinum toxin blocks nerve activity in the muscles, causing a temporary reduction in muscle activity.</p><p>Myobloc is used to treat cervical dystonia (severe spasms in the neck muscles).</p><p>Myobloc is also used to treat chronic drooling (sialorrhea).</p><p>Myobloc may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive this medicine if you are allergic to botulinum toxin, or if you have an infection in the area where the medicine will be injected.</p><p>The botulinum toxin contained in this medication can spread to other body areas beyond where it was injected. This can cause serious life-threatening side effects.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have a hoarse voice, drooping eyelids, vision problems, severe muscle weakness, loss of bladder control, or trouble breathing, talking, or swallowing. <b>Some of these effects can occur up to several weeks after a botulinum toxin injection.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Myobloc if you are allergic to botulinum toxin, or if you have an infection in the area where the medicine will be injected.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had a side effect after receiving a botulinum toxin in the past.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of contamination, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Ask your doctor about any possible risk.</p><p>It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How is Myobloc given?</h2><p>This medicine is injected into a muscle or into a gland. A healthcare provider will give you this injection once every 12 to 16 weeks. Myobloc injections should be spaced at least 3 months apart.</p><p>Your injections may be given into more than one area at a time, depending on the condition being treated.</p><p>The effects of a Myobloc injection are temporary. Your symptoms may return completely within 3 months after an injection. After repeat injections, it may take less and less time before your symptoms return, especially if your body develops antibodies to the botulinum toxin.</p><p>Do not seek botulinum toxin injections from more than one medical professional at a time. If you switch healthcare providers, be sure to tell your new provider how long it has been since your last botulinum toxin injection.</p><p>Using this medicine more often than prescribed will not make it more effective and may result in serious side effects.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since botulinum toxin has a temporary effect and is given at widely spaced intervals, missing a dose is not likely to be harmful.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may not appear right away, but can include muscle weakness, trouble swallowing, weak or shallow breathing, or loss of movement in any part of your body.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving Myobloc?</h2><p>Myobloc may impair your vision or depth perception.
