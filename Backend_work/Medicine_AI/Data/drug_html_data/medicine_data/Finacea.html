Azelaic acid helps the skin to renew itself more quickly and therefore reduces pimple and blackhead formation. It also helps to kill the bacteria that cause acne and rosacea.</p><p>Finacea is used to treat mild to moderate rosacea (a skin condition marked by red eruptions, usually on the cheeks and nose.)</p><p>Finacea may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Finacea if you are allergic to azelaic acid or propylene glycol.

Wait until these conditions have healed before using this medication. Do not cover the area after applying Finacea. Doing so could cause too much medicine to be absorbed by your body and could be harmful.</p><p>It may take up 4 weeks or longer before your symptoms improve. Keep using Finacea as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 12 weeks of treatment.</p><p>If you have excessive burning, dryness, or irritation, ask your doctor about using Finacea once daily.</p><h2>Before using Finacea</h2><p>You should not use Finacea gel if you are allergic to azelaic acid or propylene glycol.</p><p>Finacea is not expected to harm an unborn baby.
