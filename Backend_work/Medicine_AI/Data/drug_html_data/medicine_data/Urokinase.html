Make sure any doctor caring for you afterward knows you have received  urokinase.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with urokinase if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>

Make sure any doctor caring for your pregnancy or your baby knows you have received this medicine.</p><p>Urokinase is made from human plasma (part of the blood) which may contain viruses and other infectious agents. Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of it containing infectious agents, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication.</p><h2>How is urokinase given?</h2><p>Urokinase is injected into a vein through an IV. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Urokinase is given slowly, usually over a period of 12 hours, using a continuous infusion pump.</p><p>Your breathing, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs will be watched closely while you are receiving urokinase.</p><p>After treatment with urokinase, your doctor may prescribe a blood thinner or other medication to help prevent future blood clots. Carefully follow all dosing instructions. These medications can make it easier for you to bleed, even from a minor injury.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive urokinase in a clinical setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since this medication is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving urokinase?</h2><p><b>Ask your doctor before taking aspirin or ibuprofen</b> (Motrin, Advil) shortly after you have received urokinase. These medications can increase your risk of bleeding.</p><p>Avoid activities that may increase your risk of bleeding or injury. Use extra care to prevent bleeding while shaving or brushing your teeth.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Urokinase side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Urokinase increases your risk of bleeding, which can be severe or life-threatening.</b> Call your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have bleeding that will not stop. Bleeding may occur from a surgical incision, or from the skin where a needle was inserted during a blood test or while receiving injectable medication.
