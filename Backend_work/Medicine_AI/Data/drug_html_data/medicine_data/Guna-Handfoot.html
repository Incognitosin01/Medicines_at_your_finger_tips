<br/></p><h2>4. CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">4.1.    There is no history of hypersensitivity to GUNA®-HANDFOOT. However patients with a known hypersensitivity to any ingredients should be tested before use. Make a spot injection (0.1ml) into the forearm and observe for any reactions for 1 hour.</p><h2>5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First">5.1.    Hand/Foot pain requires differential diagnosis for primary nerve pain, post-traumatic pain, pain due to bone fractures, or post fracture pain.<br/>
5.2.    In rare cases patients may experience hypersalivation within one hour of treatment. Discontinue treatment. The hypersalivation resolves over several hours without further medical treatment.<br/>
5.3.    Skin cleansing/disinfection is required before application. Saprophytic bacteria may produce injection site abscesses with improper skin preparation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h2>6. ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">6.1.    The most common mild adverse reaction is slight reddening at the injection site due to the mechanical effect of the needle or a superficial skin reaction of mild erythema.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>7. DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><p class="First">7.1.    None known</p><h2>8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><p class="First">8.1.    No restrictions, although indications target the use of GUNA®-HANDFOOT to adults, with the aim of pain management of the hand/foot area.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>9. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</h2><p class="First">9.1.    No Known</p><h2>10. OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">10.1.    No Known</p><h2>11. DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First"> 11.1    GUNA®-HANDFOOT is a sterile solution made with isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br/>
It is a homeopathic complex medicine, whose active ingredients have been selected in order to promote 2 main activities:<br/>
•    Detoxification of the connective tissue matrix,<br/>
•    Pain modulation through stimulation of the physiological mechanism of the pain control.<br/>
Furthermore, the attenuation of the biological substrates acts to target the area of activity of the product.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">12.1.    Mechanism of Action<br/>
Due to the homeopathic nature of the active ingredients, receptors may be activated by feedback regulation. Beta-endorphins at the 4C strength activate the membrane receptor for endogen endorphins that play a key role in pain relief. Anti IL-1 induces a download regulation of IL-1 inflammatory activity.<br/>
12.2.    Pharmacodynamics<br/>
The physiological effects of GUNA®-HANDFOOT are due to the action of the ingredients, as described in the Homeopathic Materia Medica.<br/>
In Homeopathy there is no direct relationship between dose and effect, but rather there is a relationship between attenuation and balancing effect on biochemical pathways.<br/>
In GUNA®-HANDFOOT the attenuation of each ingredient has been selected according to Arndt-Schulz Principle (inverted effect law). The attenuation of the physiological ingredients promotes membrane receptor feedback in order to normalize altered biological pathways. In Addition the attenuation technique activates the low dilutions and stabilizes clinical activity of the compound.<br/>
12.3.    Pharmacokinetics<br/>
The homeopathic attenuation provides complete bioavailability of the active ingredients.<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h2>13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><p class="First">13.1.    GUNA®-HANDFOOT has no level of toxicity due to the attenuation of the ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">14.1    GUNA®-HANDFOOT formulation is based on classical Homeopathy and each ingredient has been selected according to its description in the Homeopathic Materia Medica. The product is intended for application to target points such as acupuncture points, Weihe points, and key neurological points.<br/>
Clinical indications of the key ingredients:<br/>
<span class="Bold">Anti interleukin 1 alpha 4C / Anti interleukin 1 beta 4C</span>:<br/>
•    Biological classification: Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) belongs to the IL-1 family. Endogenous IL-1ra is produced in human autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases.<br/>
•    Etiopathogenesis: It binds to IL-1 receptors in competition with IL-1, but does not elicit intracellular response from this binding. Its key role is counteracting the proinflammatory effects of IL-1.<br/>
•    Space-time localization: It is next to Arnica. Reference group: Arnica-Mercurius.<br/>
•    Clinical: Immunological based diseases, autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, acute and chronic pain, osteoarthritis, chronic arthritis, inflammatory psoriasis, wet eczema, localized inflammatory swelling. Appropriate for local application.<br/>
•    Modalities: Worsens with cold and movement. Improves with rest and warm.<br/>
•    Association with other cell mediators: TNF 15C / IL8 4C / NT4 4C / GCSF 4C.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Beta- Endorphin 4C</span>:<br/>
•    Biological classification: Neuropeptide  and neurotransmitter. It is produced by the  anterior lobe of the hypophysis  and by the hypothalamus.<br/>
•    Etiopathogenesis: It acts on the mechanism that enhances pain. It suppresses the memory of painful events and negative experiences.<br/>
•    Space-time localization: next to Arnica.<br/>
Reference group: Mercurius.<br/>
•    Clinical: Pain management by enhancing the immune response. It acts on modulating pain, cardiac, gastric and vascular function as well as panic syndrome and satiation. Organic and functional pain. Remedy for somatization disorders. It enhances acupuncture sessions. Antidepressive activity. It may improve individual positive attitudes.<br/>
•    Modalities:  Worsens due to fatigue and intensive exercise.<br/>
•    Association with other cell mediators: Sepia / Arnica / Aconitum / Bromum / Aurum / Iodium / IL6 4CH / Melatonin 15C, 30C, 12LM, 18LM, 30LM / NT4 4C / BDNF 4C.<br/>
