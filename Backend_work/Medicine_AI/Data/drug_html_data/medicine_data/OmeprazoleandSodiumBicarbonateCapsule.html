</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to substituted benzimidazoles or to any components of the formulation. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute interstitial nephritis, and urticaria<span class="Italics">. [<span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ,</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]</span></span></li>
<li>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules, are contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine containing products [<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"> </span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">see Drug Interactions (7) ].</span></span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Presence of Gastric Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.</p><h3>Acute Interstitial Nephritis</h3><p class="First">Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules if acute interstitial nephritis develops. <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">[see Contraindications (4)</span><span class="Bold"> </span>]</span></p><h3>Sodium Bicarbonate Buffer Content</h3><p class="First">Each 20 mg and 40 mg of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsule contains, 1,100 mg (13 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each capsule is 304 mg.</p><p>Chronic administration of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause milk-alkali syndrome. Chronic use of sodium bicarbonate may lead to systemic alkalosis, and increased sodium intake can produce edema and weight gain.<br/></p><p>The sodium content of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate products should be taken into consideration when administering to patients on a sodium-restricted diet or those at risk for developing congestive heart failure.</p><p>Avoid Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules may be associated with an increased risk of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients.<br/>
This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve. <span class="Italics">[<span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]</span>.</span><br/>
<br/>
Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer).<br/>
Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.<br/>
Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to the established treatment guidelines. <span class="Italics">[ <span class="Bold">see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )</span> and <span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]</span>.</span></p><h3>Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First">Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including omeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.<br/>
<br/>
The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.<br/>
<br/>
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.<br/>
<br/>
Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</p><h3>Interaction with Clopidogrel</h3><p class="First">Avoid concomitant use of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as omeprazole, that interfere with CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 80 mg omeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel, even when administered 12 hours apart. When using Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules, consider alternative antiplatelet therapy.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">[ see Drug Interactions ( 7 )</span> </span><span class="Italics">  and<span class="Bold"> </span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"> </span>].</span></p><h3>Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules.</p><h3>Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.<br/>
For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically. <span class="Italics">[<span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">see Adverse Reactions</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">(6.2) ].</span></span></p><h3>Interaction with St John’s Wort or Rifampin</h3><p class="First">Drugs which induce CYP2C19 OR CYP3A4 (such as St John’s wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease omeprazole concentrations <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">[ see Drug Interactions (7) ]</span></span>. Avoid concomitant use of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules with St John’s wort or rifampin.</p><h3>Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p class="First">Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules treatment for at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary. <span class="Bold">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span></p><h3>Interaction with Methotrexate</h3><p class="First">Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose</p><p>methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients. <span class="Bold">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span></p><h3>Fundic Gland Polyps</h3><p class="First">PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPIs users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules in pregnant women. Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules contains omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Omeprazole<br/></span><br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with omeprazole in pregnant women. Available epidemiologic data fail to demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with first trimester omeprazole use. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits resulted in dose-dependent embryo-lethality at omeprazole doses that were approximately 3.4 to 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg (based on a body surface area for a 60 kg person). Teratogenicity was not observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of oral esomeprazole (an enantiomer of omeprazole) magnesium in rats and rabbits during organogenesis with doses about 68 times and 42 times, respectively, an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole (based on bodysurface area for a 60 kg person). Changes in bone morphology were observed in offspring of rats dosed through most of pregnancy and lactation at doses equal to or greater than approximately 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole. When maternal administration was confined to gestation only, there were no effects on bone physeal morphology in the offspring at any age (<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Data</span>).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Sodium Bicarbonate<br/></span><br/>
Available data with sodium bicarbonate use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published animal studies report that sodium bicarbonate administered to rats, mice or rabbits during pregnancy did not cause adverse developmental effects in offspring.<br/>
The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Human Data<br/>
<br/></span> There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules in pregnant women. Four published epidemiological studies compared the frequency of congenital abnormalities among infants born to women who used omeprazole during pregnancy with the frequency of abnormalities among infants of women exposed to H2-receptor antagonists or other controls.<br/>
<br/>
A population-based retrospective cohort epidemiological study from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, covering approximately 99% of pregnancies, from 1995-99, reported on 955 infants (824 exposed during the first trimester with 39 of these exposed beyond first trimester, and 131 exposed after the first trimester) whose mothers used omeprazole during pregnancy. The number of infants exposed <span class="Italics">in utero</span> to omeprazole that had any malformation, low birth weight, low Apgar score, or hospitalization was similar to the number observed in this population. The number of infants born with ventricular septal defects and the number of stillborn infants was slightly higher in the omeprazole- exposed infants than the expected number in this population.<br/>
<br/>
A population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996-2009 reported on 1,800 live births whose mothers used omeprazole during the first trimester of pregnancy and 837,317 live births whose mothers did not use any PPI. The overall rate of birth defects in infants born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole was 2.9% and 2.6% in infants born to mothers not exposed to any PPI during the first trimester.<br/>
<br/>
A retrospective cohort study reported on 689 pregnant women exposed to either H2-blockers or omeprazole in the first trimester (134 exposed to omeprazole) and 1,572 pregnant women unexposed to either during the first trimester. The overall malformation rate in offspring born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole, an H2-blocker, or were unexposed was 3.6%, 5.5%, and 4.1% respectively.<br/>
<br/>
A small prospective observational cohort study followed 113 women exposed to omeprazole during pregnancy (89% first trimester exposures). The reported rate of major congenital malformations was 4% in the omeprazole group, 2% in controls exposed to non-teratogens, and 2.8% in disease-paired controls. Rates of spontaneous and elective abortions, preterm deliveries, gestational age at delivery, and mean birth weight were similar among the groups.<br/>
<br/>
Several studies have reported no apparent adverse short-term effects on the infant when single-dose oral or intravenous omeprazole was administered to over 200 pregnant women as premedication for cesarean section under general anesthesia<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal Data<br/></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Omeprazole</span><br/>
<br/></span> Reproductive studies conducted with omeprazole in rats at oral doses up to  138 mg/kg/day (about 34  times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at doses up to 69.1 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) during organogenesis did not disclose any evidence for a teratogenic potential of omeprazole. In rabbits, omeprazole in a dose range of 6.9 to 69.1 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) administered during organogenesis produced dose-related increases in embryo-lethality, fetal resorptions, and pregnancy disruptions. In rats, dose-related embryo/fetal toxicity and postnatal developmental toxicity were observed in offspring resulting from parents treated with omeprazole at 13.8 to 138.0 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), administered prior to mating through the lactationperiod.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Esomeprazole</span><br/>
<br/></span> The data described below was generated from studies using esomeprazole, an enantiomer of omeprazole.

No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in reproduction studies with esomeprazole magnesium in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 42 times an oral human dose of 40 mg of esomeprazole or 40 mg  omeprazole on a body surface area basis) administered  during organogenesis.<br/>
<br/>
A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development were performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg of esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis). Neonatal/early postnatal (birth to weaning) survival was decreased at doses equal toor greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis). Body weight and body weight gain were reduced and neurobehavioral or general developmental delays in the immediate post-weaning timeframe were evident at doses equal to or greater than 69 mg/kg/day (about 17 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis). In addition, decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses of esomeprazole magnesium equal to  or greater than  14 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a  body surface area basis). Physeal dysplasia in the femur was observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of esomeprazole magnesium at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis).<br/>

Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in a pre- and postnatal toxicity study when esomeprazole magnesium was administered at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis). When rats were dosed from gestational Day 7 through weaning on postnatal Day 21, a  statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses of esomeprazole magnesium equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg  on a body surface area  basis).<br/>
<br/>
A pre- and postnatal development study in rats with esomeprazole strontium (using equimolar doses compared to esomeprazole magnesium study) produced similar results in dams and pups as described above.<br/>
<br/>
A follow up developmental toxicity study in rats with further time points to evaluate pup bone  development from postnatal day 2 to adulthood was performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) where esomeprazole administration was from either gestational day 7 or gestational day 16 until parturition. When maternal administration was confined to gestation only, there were no effects on bone physeal morphology in the offspring at any age.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
<br/>
Available data from the published literature suggest both components of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules, omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate, are present in human milk. There are no clinical data on the effects of omeprazole or sodium bicarbonate on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules have not been established in pediatric patients.<br/>

<span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Data<br/></span><br/>
Esomeprazole, an enantiomer of omeprazole, was shown to decrease body weight, body weight gain, femur weight, femur length, and overall growth at oral doses about 34 to 68 times a daily human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazolebased on body surface area in a juvenile rat toxicity study. The animal to human dose multiples are based on the assumption of equal systemic exposure to esomeprazole in humans following oral administration of either 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole.<br/>
<br/>
A 28-day toxicity study with a 14-day recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats with esomeprazole magnesium at doses of 70 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 17 to 68 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazoleon a body surface area basis). An increase in the number of deaths at the high dose of 280 mg/kg/day was observed when juvenile rats were administered esomeprazole magnesium from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 35. In addition, doses equal to or greater than 140 mg/kg/day (about 34 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a  body surface area basis), produced treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length, and affected overall growth. Comparable findings described above have also been observed in this study with another esomeprazole salt, esomeprazole strontium, at equimolar doses of esomeprazole.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Omeprazole was administered to over 2000 elderly individuals (≥65 years of age) in clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. There were no differences in safety and effectiveness between the elderly and younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.<br/>
<br/>
Pharmacokinetic studies with buffered omeprazole have shown the elimination rate was somewhat decreased in the elderly and bioavailability was increased. The plasma clearance of omeprazole was 250 mL/min (about half that of young subjects). The plasma half-life averaged one hour, about twice that in nonelderly, healthy subjects taking Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules. However, no dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly. </p><p><span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> </p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B, or C) exposure to omeprazole substantially increased compared to healthy subjects.

<br/>
Reports have been received of overdosage with omeprazole in humans. Doses ranged up to 2400 mg (120 times the usual recommended clinical dose). Manifestations were variable, but included confusion, drowsiness, blurred vision, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, flushing, headache, dry mouth, and other adverse reactions similar to those seen in clinical experience with the recommended dosage <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">[ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]</span> . </span>Symptoms were transient, and no serious clinical outcome has been reported when omeprazole was taken alone. No specific antidote for omeprazole overdosage is known. Omeprazole is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not readily dialyzable. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.</p><p><br/>

Omeprazole is a substituted benzimidazole, 5-methoxy-2- [[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole, a racemic mixture of two enantiomers that inhibits gastric acid secretion. Its empirical formula is C17H19N3O3S, with a molecular weight of 345.42. The structural formula is:</p><p>Omeprazole is a white to off-white crystalline powder which melts with decomposition at about 155ºC. It is a weak base, freely soluble in ethanol and methanol, and slightly soluble in acetone and isopropanol and very slightly soluble in water. The stability of omeprazole is a function of pH; it is rapidly degraded in acid media but has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules are supplied as immediate-release capsules. Each capsule contains either 40 mg or 20 mg of omeprazole and 1100 mg of sodium bicarbonate with the following excipients: croscarmellose sodium and sodium stearyl fumarate. The capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide and the colorants FD&amp;C Blue # 1, FD&amp;C Red # 3, FD&amp;C Red 40 and the components of blue imprinting edible ink are TekPrintTM SB-6003 Blue Ink (butyl alcohol, dehydrated alcohol, FD&amp;C Blue # 2 aluminum lake, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, shellac, strong ammonium solution).</p><p>Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules are immediate-release formulations that contain sodium bicarbonate which raises the gastric pH and thus protects omeprazole from acid degradation.</p><h2>Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsule - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Omeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a  gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. </p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antisecretory Activity</span></p><p>Results from a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study of the antisecretory effect of repeated once-daily dosing of 40 mg and 20 mg of  Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate in healthy subjects are shown in <span class="Bold">Table 6 </span>below.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 6: Effect of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate on Intragastric pH, Day 7</span></p><p><span class="Sup">1.    </span> P&lt;0.05 20 mg vs. 40 mg</p><p>Results from a separate PK/PD study of antisecretory effect on repeated once-daily dosing of 40 mg/1,100 mg and 20 mg/1,100 mg of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules in healthy subjects show similar effects in general on the above three PD parameters as those for Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate 40 mg/1,680 mg and 20 mg/1,680 mg Oral Suspension respectively.</p><p>The antisecretory effect lasts longer than would be expected from the very short (1 hour) plasma half- life, apparently due to irreversible binding to the parietal H+/K+ ATPase enzyme.</p><p><span class="Bold">Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects</span></p><p>Human gastric biopsy specimens have been obtained from more than 3000 patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical trials. The incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia has been found in these patients. These studies are of insufficient duration and size to rule out the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole on the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions.</p><p><span class="Bold">Serum Gastrin Effects</span></p><p>In studies involving more than 200 patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1 to 2 weeks of once-daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole in parallel with inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued treatment. In comparison with histamine H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonists, the median increases produced by 20 mg doses of omeprazole were higher (1.3 to 3.6-fold vs. 1.1 to 1.8-fold increase). Gastrin values returned to pretreatment levels, usually within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</span></span><span class="Italics"> ]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Effects</span></p><p>Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2 to 4 weeks, had no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin.</p><p>No effect on gastric emptying of the solid and liquid components of a test meal was demonstrated after a single intravenous dose of omeprazole 90 mg. In healthy subjects, a single I.V. dose of omeprazole (0.35 mg/kg) had no effect on intrinsic factor secretion. No systematic dose-dependent effect has been observed on basal or stimulated pepsin output in humans. However, when intragastric pH is maintained at 4.0 or above, basal pepsin output is low, and pepsin activity is decreased.</p><p>As do other agents that elevate intragastric pH, omeprazole administered for 14 days in healthy subjects produced a significant increase in the intragastric concentrations of viable bacteria. The pattern of the bacterial species was unchanged from that commonly found in saliva. All changes resolved within three days of stopping treatment.</p><p>The course of Barrett's esophagus in 106 patients was evaluated in a U.S. double-blind controlled study of omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for 12 months followed by 20 mg twice daily for 12 months or ranitidine 300 mg twice daily for 24 months. No clinically significant impact on Barrett's mucosa by antisecretory therapy was observed. Although neosquamous epithelium developed during antisecretory therapy, complete elimination of Barrett's mucosa was not achieved. No significant difference was observed between treatment groups in development of dysplasia in Barrett's mucosa and no patient developed esophageal carcinoma during treatment. No significant differences between treatment groups were observed in development of ECL cell hyperplasia, corpus atrophic gastritis, corpus intestinal metaplasia, or colon polyps exceeding 3 mm in diameter.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption<br/>

<br/>
The mean plasma omeprazole half-life following administration of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules in healthy subjects is approximately 1 hour (range 0.4 to 4.2 hours), and the total body clearance is 500 to 600 mL/min.</p><p><span class="Italics"><br/>
Excretion</span></p><p>Following single-dose oral administration of a buffered solution of omeprazole, the majority of the dose (about 77%) is eliminated in urine as at least six metabolites. Two metabolites have been identified as hydroxyomeprazole and the corresponding carboxylic acid. The remainder of the dose was recoverable in feces. This implies a significant biliary excretion of the metabolites of omeprazole. Three metabolites have been identified in plasma – the sulfide and sulfone derivatives of omeprazole, and hydroxyomeprazole. These metabolites have very little or no antisecretory activity.</p><p><span class="Bold"><br/>

Nearly 70% of the dose was recovered in urine as metabolites of omeprazole, and no unchanged drug was detected. The plasma clearance of omeprazole was 250 mL/min (about half that of young subjects), and its plasma half-life averaged one hour, similar to that of young healthy subjects.<br/></p><p><span class="Italics"><br/>

Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (approximately 3.36 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) for one year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of one year (94% treated versus 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% versus 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for two years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. In a 52-week toxicity study in Sprague Dawley rats, brain astrocytomas were found in a small number of males that received omeprazole at dose levels of 0.4, 2, and 16 mg/kg/day (about 0.1 to 3.9 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis). No astrocytomas were observed in female rats in this study. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats, no astrocytomas were found in males and females at the high dose of 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 34 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis). A 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive. A 26-week p53 (+/-) transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study was not positive.<br/>
<br/>
Omeprazole was positive for clastogenic effects in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay, in one of two <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus tests, and in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> bone marrow cell chromosomal aberration assay. Omeprazole was negative in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames Test, an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat liver DNA damage assay.<br/>
<br/>
In a 24-month carcinogenicity studies in rats, a dose-related significant increase in gastric carcinoid tumors and ECL cell hyperplasia was observed in both male and female animals<span class="Italics">.</span>Carcinoid tumors have also been observed in rats subjected to fundectomy or long- term treatment with other proton pump inhibitors PPIs or high doses of H2-receptor antagonists.<br/>
<br/>
Omeprazole at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day (about 33.6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) was found to have no effect on the fertility and general reproductive performance in rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate Capsules has been established, in part, based on studies of an oral delayed- release omeprazole product for the treatment of active duodenal ulcer, active benign gastric ulcer, symptomatic GERD, EE due to acid-mediated GERD, and maintenance of healing of EE due to acid- mediated GERD [<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">see Clinical Studies</span> (<span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">14.1 ,</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">14.2</span></span>, <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">14.3</span></span>, <span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">14.4 ,</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">14.5 )</span></span>]</p><h3>Active Duodenal Ulcer</h3><p class="First">In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 147 patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer, the percentage of patients healed (per protocol) at 2 and 4 weeks was significantly higher with omeprazole delayed-release capsules 20 mg once a day than with placebo (p ≤ 0.01).
