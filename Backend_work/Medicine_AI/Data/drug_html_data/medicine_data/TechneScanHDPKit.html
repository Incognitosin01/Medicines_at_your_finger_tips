</ul><h2>TechneScan HDP Kit Description</h2><p class="First">Technescan™ HDP is supplied as a lyophilized powder, packaged under nitrogen in vials for intravenous administration after reconstitution with ADDITIVE-FREE sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m. Each vial contains 3.15 mg oxidronate sodium and 0.258 mg, minimum, stannous chloride (SnCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O), 0.297 mg, theoretical, stannous chloride (SnCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O) with 0.343 mg, maximum, tin chloride [stannous and stannic] dihydrate as SnCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O as active ingredients. In addition, each vial contains 0.84 mg gentisic acid as a stabilizer and 30.0 mg sodium chloride. The pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. The pH of the reconstituted drug is between 4.0 and 5.5. The contents of the vial are sterile and non-pyrogenic.</p><p>The chemical structure of oxidronate sodium is:</p><p>This radiopharmaceutical diagnostic agent, when reconstituted with ADDITIVE-FREE sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m forms a complex of unknown structure.</p><h2>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2><p class="First">Technetium Tc 99m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half-life of 6.02 hours.1The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging is listed in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Italics">Table 1.

The first half-value thickness of lead (Pb) for Technetium Tc 99m is 0.017 cm. A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2. For example, the use of 0.25 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1000.</p><p><span class="Italics">Table 2.

Blood levels are about 10% of the injected dose at one hour post-injection and continue to fall to about 6%, 4% and 3% at 2, 3 and 4 hours, respectively. When measured at 24 hours following its administration, skeletal retention is approximately 50% of the injected dose. Technescan HDP exhibits its greatest affinity for areas of altered osteogenesis and actively metabolizing bone.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for TechneScan HDP Kit</h2><p class="First">Technescan HDP Tc 99m is a diagnostic skeletal imaging agent used to demonstrate areas of altered osteogenesis in adult and pediatric patients.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate may cause life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions.    Have cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and personnel available and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>This class of compounds is known to complex cations such as calcium. Particular caution should be used with patients who have, or who may be predisposed to hypocalcemia (i.e., alkalosis).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">The components of the kit are sterile and non-pyrogenic. It is essential that the user follow the directions carefully and adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation. Sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m solutions which contain an oxidizing agent or saline solutions containing preservatives are not suitable for use in the preparation of Technescan HDP Tc 99m.</p><p>Contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate and are NOT to be administered directly to the patient. Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate should be formulated within eight (8) hours prior to clinical use. Optimal imaging results are obtained one to four hours after administration. Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate as well as other radioactive drugs, must be handled with care, and appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize radiation exposure to the patients consistent with proper patient management and to ensure minimum radiation exposure to occupational workers. Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by specific training in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides. To minimize radiation dose to the bladder, the patients should be encouraged to drink fluids and to void immediately before the examination and as often thereafter as possible for the next four to six hours.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or whether Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate affects fertility in males and females.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate. It is also not known whether Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Ideally, examinations using radiopharmaceuticals, especially those elective in nature, of a woman of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few (approximately 10) days following the onset of menses.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Technetium Tc 99m is excreted in human milk during lactation, therefore formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings.</p><h3>Overdose</h3><p class="First">In the event of the administration of an overdose with Technescan HDP, encourage patients to drink fluids and void frequently to reduce the radiation dose to the patient.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening reactions, as well as nausea, vomiting and injection site reactions, have been infrequently reported with Technetium Tc 99m Oxidronate use.</p><h2>TechneScan HDP Kit Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Instructions</h3><p class="First">The recommended adult dose of Technetium Tc 99m-labeled Technescan HDP is 555 MBq (15 mCi) with a range of 370 to 740 MBq (10 to 20 mCi). The recommended pediatric dose is 7.4 MBq (0.20 mCi)/kg with a range of 7.4 to 13 MBq (0.20 to 0.35 mCi)/kg. The recommended minimum total pediatric dose is 37 MBq (1.0 mCi). The maximum total dose injected into a pediatric or adult patient is 740 MBq (20.0 mCi). The maximum dose of oxidronate sodium should not exceed 2 mg.</p><p>Unit dose preparation instructions should be followed for pediatric patients. The radioactivity of each dose should be measured by a suitable radiation calibration system just prior to administration. The dose should be given intravenously by slow injection. For optimal results imaging should be performed 1 to 4 hours post-injection.</p><h2>RADIATION DOSIMETRY</h2><p class="First">The estimated absorbed radiation doses from an intravenous injection of Technetium Tc 99m-labeled Technescan HDP are shown in Table 4.</p><p><span class="Italics">Table 4.

Use shielded syringe during transport and administration of Tc 99m solutions.</p><h2>UNIT DOSE PREPARATION</h2><h3>Preparing a dose for a single adult patient or for a pediatric patient</h3><p class="First">To minimize volume injected and to ensure optimum solution concentration, reconstitute the vial contents in 3 to 6 mL of sterile, non-pyrogenic normal saline containing no preservatives. Shake the vial gently for approximately 30 seconds to assure complete dissolution, withdraw and discard all but approximately 1 mL of the solution. Add appropriate amount of sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m for a single adult dose or for one or more pediatric doses and shake gently. Proceed with steps 4 and 5. No more than 1480 MBq (40 mCi) should be added to the vial when preparing multiple pediatric doses. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>How is TechneScan HDP Kit Supplied</h2><p class="First">Technescan HDP is supplied as a lyophilized powder packaged in vials. Each vial contains 3.15 mg oxidronate sodium and 0.258 mg, minimum, stannous chloride (SnCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O), 0.297 mg, theoretical, stannous chloride (SnCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O) with 0.343 mg, maximum, tin chloride [stannous and stannic] dihydrate as SnCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•2H<span class="Sub">2</span>O.
