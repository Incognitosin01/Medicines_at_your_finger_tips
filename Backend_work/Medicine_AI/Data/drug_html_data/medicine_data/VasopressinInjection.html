This is a condition that causes the body to lose too much water and become dehydrated. Vasopressin injection is also used to prevent and treat abdominal or stomach distension that occurs after surgery. It is also used in abdominal or stomach roentgenography.</p><p>Vasopressin injection is also used to increase blood pressure in adults with vasodilatory shock (eg, post-cardiotomy, sepsis) who remain to have low blood pressure after receiving fluids and medicines.</p><p>Vasopressin is a hormone that is produced in the body. It acts on the kidneys to reduce the flow of urine.</p><p>Vasopressin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using vasopressin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For vasopressin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to vasopressin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Vasostrict® in children with vasodilatory shock. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Pitressin® in children with diabetes insipidus and abdominal distension.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Vasostrict® have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Vasostrict®.</p><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of Pitressin® in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
