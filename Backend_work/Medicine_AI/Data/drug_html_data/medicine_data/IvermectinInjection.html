</ul><p class="First"><br/></p><h2>Mode of Action</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin is a member of the macrocyclic lactone class of endectocides which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)</p><p>The margin of safety for compounds of this clas sis attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrcyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.<br/></p><h2>Indications</h2><h3>Persistent Activity</h3><p class="First">Ivermectin Injection has been proved to effectively control infections and to protect cattle from reinfection with<span class="Italics">Dictyocaulus viviparus</span> and <span class="Italics">Oesophagostomum radiatum</span> for 28 days after treatment;<span class="Italics">Ostertagia ostertagi, Trichostrongylus axei</span> and <span class="Italics">Cooperia punctata</span> for 21 days after treatment;<span class="Italics">Haemonchus placei</span> and <span class="Italics">Cooperia oncophora</span>for 14 days after treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Swine</span>:  Ivermectin Injection is indicated for the effective treatment and control of the follwoing harmful species of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, lice and mange mites in swine:</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cattle</span>:  IVERMECTIN should be given only by subcutaneous injection under the loose skin in front of or behind the shoulder at the recommended dose level of 200 mcg ivermectin per kilogram of body weight. Each mL of IVERMECTIN contains 10 mg of ivermectin, sufficient to treat 110 lb (50 kg) of body weight (maximum 10 mL per injection site.).<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><span class="Bold">Swine</span>: IVERMECTIN should be given only by subcutaneous injection in the neck of swine at the reocmmended dose level of 300 mcg ivermectin per kilogram (2.2 lb) of body weight. Each mL of IVERMECTIN contains 10 mg of ivermectin, sufficient to treat 75 lb of body weight.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cattle: Ivermectin Injection is to be given subcutaneously only, to reduce risk of potentially fatal clostridial infection of the injection site.<br/></span> Animals should be appropriately restrained to achieve the proper route of administration. Use of a 16-gauge, 1/2 to 3/4" needle is suggested. Inject under the loose skin in front of or behind the shoulder (see illustration). When using the 200 mL, 500 mL size, use only automatic syringe equipment. Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant. Clean, properly disinfected needles should be used to reduce the potential for injection site infections. No special handling or protective clothing is necessary.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Recommended Treatment Program</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SWINE</span>: At the time of initiating any parasite control program, it is important to treat all breeding animals in the herd. After the initial treatment, use Ivermectin Injection regularly as follows:<br/>
<span class="Bold">BREEDING ANIMALS:<br/>
Sows</span>:  Treatment prior to farrowing, preferably 7 - 14 days before, to minimize infection of piglets.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Gilts</span>:   Treat 7 - 14 days prior to breeding.<br/>
            Treat 7 - 14 days prior to farrowing.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Boars</span>: Frequency and need for treatment are dependent upon exposure.  Treat at least two times a year.<br/>
<span class="Bold">FEEDER PIGS<br/>
(Weaners/Growers/Fininshers)<br/></span> All weaner/feeder pigs should be treated before placement in clean quarters.<br/>
Pigs exposed to contaminated soil or pasture may need retreatment if reinfection occurs.<br/>
<span class="Bold">NOTE</span>:<br/>
(1) Ivermectin Injection has a persistent drug level sufficient to control mite infestations throughout the egg to adult life cycle. However, since the ivermectin effect is not immediate, care must be taken to prevent reinfestation from exposure to untreated animals or contaminated facilities. Generally, pigs should not be moved to clean quarters or exposed to uninfested pigs for approximately one week quarters or exposed to uninfested pigs for approximately one week after treatment. Sows should be treated at least one week before farrowing to minimize transfer of mites to newborn baby pigs.<br/>
(2) Louse eggs are unaffected by Ivermectin Injection and may require up to three weeks to hatch. Louse infestations developing from hatching eggs may require retreatment.<br/>
(3) Consult a veterinarian for aid in teh diagnosis and control of internal and external parasites of swine.</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><br/></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RESIDUE WARNING</span>: Do not treat reindeer or American bison within 8 weeks (56 days) of slaughter. </p><p><span class="Bold">WARNING</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Not for use in humans.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Keep this and all drugs our to reach of children.</span></p><p>The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occurpational safety information.

  Do not treat swine within 18 days of slaughter.<br/></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Transitory discomfort has been observed in some cattle following subcutaneous administration. A low incidence of soft tissue swelling at the injection site has been observed. These reactions have disappeared without treatment. For cattle, divide doses greater than 10 mL between two injection sites to reduce occasional discomfort or site reaction.</p><p>Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant. Clean, properly disinfected needles should be used to reduce the potential for injection site infection.</p><p>Observe cattle for injection site reactions. Reactions may be due to clostridial infection and should be aggressively treated with appropriate antibiotics. If injection site infections are suspected, consult your veterinarian.</p><p>This product is not for intravenous or intramuscular use.</p><p>Protect product from light.<br/></p><p>Ivermectin Injection for Cattle and Swine has been developed specifically for use in cattle, swine, reindeer and American bison <span class="Bold">only</span>. This product should not be used in other animal species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs may result.</p><p><span class="Bold">When to Treat Cattle with Grubs</span><br/>
IVERMECTIN effectively controls all stages of cattle grubs. However, proper timing of treatment is important. For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after the end of the heel fly (warble fly) season. Destruction of <span class="Italics">Hypoderma</span> larvae (cattle grubs) at the period when these grubs are in vital areas may cause undesirable host-parasite reactions including the possibility of fatalities. Killing <span class="Italics">Hypoderma lineatum</span> when it is in the tissue surrounding the esophagus (gullet) may cause salivation and bloat.: Killing <span class="Italics">H. bovis</span> when it is in the vertebral canal may cause staggering or paralysis. These reactions are not specific to treatment with a IVERMECTIN, but can occur with any successful treatment of grubs. Cattle should be treated either before or after these stages of grub development. Consult your veterinarian concerning the proper time for treatment. Cattle treated with IVERMECTIN after the end of the heel fly season may be retreated with IVERMECTIN during the winter for internal parasites, mange mites, or sucking lice without danger of grub-related reactions. A planned parasite control program is recommended.</p><h2>Environmental Safety</h2><p class="First">Studies indicate that when ivermectin comes in contact with the soil, it readily and tightly binds to the soil and becomes inactive over time. Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish and certain water born organisms on which they feed. Do not permit water runoff from feedlots or production sites to enter lakes, streams, or ponds. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by the improper disposal of drug containers. Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration.<br/>
As with other avermectins, ivermectin is excreted in the dung of treated animals and can inhibit the reproduction and growth of pest and beneficial insets that use dung as a source of food and for reproduction. The magnitude and duration of such effects are species and lifestyle specific. When used according to label directions, the product is not expected to have an adverse impact on populations of dung-dependent insects.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>How Supplied</h2><p class="First">50 mL, 200 mL, 500 mL</p><p class="First">Store at 20-25<span class="Sup">o</span>C.</p><p>Restricted Drug (California) - use only as directed.<br/></p><p class="First"><br/></p><p class="ddc-disclaimer-link">Medical Disclaimer</p></body></html>
