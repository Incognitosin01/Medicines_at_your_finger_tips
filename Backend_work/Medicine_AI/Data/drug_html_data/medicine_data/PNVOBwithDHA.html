</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SUPPLEMENT FACTS<br/>
Each tablet contains:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">OTHER INGREDIENTS (softgel):</span> bovine gelatin, glycerin USP and water.</p><p><span class="Bold">OTHER INGREDIENTS (tablet):</span> dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pharmaceutical glaze, stearic acid and silicon dioxide,</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS:</span> PNV - OB with DHA is indicated to provide vitamin, mineral and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation prior to conception, throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period for the lactating and non-lactating mother, including individuals with known allergies to fish. PNV - OB with DHA does not contain fish, fish oils, fish proteins or fish byproducts.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> Folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Iron therapy is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage disease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyridoxine responsive anemia or cirrhosis of the liver. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Pernicious anemia should be ruled out before starting treatment. While folic acid corrects the blood picture of pernicious anemia, it does not ameliorate the attendant neurologic involvement. Resistance to treatment may be due to depressed hematopoiesis, alcoholism, the presence of anti-metabolic drugs and to deficiencies of vitamins. Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease.</p><p>Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids (such as DHA) per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and International Normalized Ratio (INR). Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients taking anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or bleeding diathesis, individuals who have or suspected that they may have iron metabolism abnormalities should use caution in using supplemental iron. Iron supplementation in these individuals may lead to excess iron in the parenchyma of many organs. Iron storage and associated organ function tests may be indicated to ensure the delivery of needed iron to the neonate while ensuring the health of the mother.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) and Vitamin B12 microbiological blood assays are invalidated by the administration of most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine. Folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) is not effective reversing the toxic effects of methotrexate. Folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid) must be used in that situation. Black tarry stools may be due to either occult GI bleeding or iron therapy or both. Folic acid may partially correct the hematological damage due to Vitamin B12 deficiency of pernicious anemia, while the associated neurological damage progresses. In rare instances, allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Supplementation of the diet by milk or other dietary sources of Calcium may be advisable. Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Allergic sensitivity reactions and gastrointestional disturbances may occur.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</span> Before, during and after pregnancy, one tablet and one softgel daily,or as directed by a physician.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED:</span> 42192-352-60.
