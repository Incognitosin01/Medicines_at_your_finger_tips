Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases the amount of acid your stomach produces. Sodium bicarbonate is an antacid that raises the pH in your stomach to keep the omeprazole from breaking down in stomach acid.</p><p>Zegerid is used to treat heartburn and other symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p><p>Zegerid is also used to treat certain type of ulcers, or to promote healing of erosive esophagitis (damage to your esophagus caused by stomach acid).</p><p>Zegerid is not for immediate relief of heartburn symptoms.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>The omeprazole found in Zegerid can cause kidney problems. Tell your doctor if you are urinating less than usual, or if you have blood in your urine.</p><p>Diarrhea may be a sign of a new infection. <b>Call your doctor if you have diarrhea that is watery or has blood in it.</b></p><p>Omeprazole may cause new or worsening symptoms of lupus. Tell your doctor if you have joint pain and a skin rash on your cheeks or arms that worsens in sunlight.</p><p><b>You may be more likely to have a broken bone while taking this medicine long term or more than once per day.</b></p><p>Zegerid contains sodium bicarbonate, a form of salt.
