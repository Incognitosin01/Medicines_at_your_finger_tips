<br/>
As First Opioid Analgesic and For Patients who are NOT Opioid Tolerant:<br/>
Extended-Release Zohydro ER Capsules: Initial dose: 10 mg orally every 12 hours<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
-Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression; monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours.<br/>
-An opioid tolerant patient is one who has been receiving for 1-week or longer at least: oral morphine 60 mg/day, fentanyl transdermal patch 25 mcg per hour, oral oxycodone 30 mg/day, oral hydromorphone 8 mg/day, oral oxymorphone 25 mg/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Zohydro ER is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose.
