</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Beleodaq Injection</h2><p class="First">Beleodaq is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).</p><p>This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies</span> (<span class="Italics">14</span>)]. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial.</p><h2>Beleodaq Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Beleodaq is 1,000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion once daily on Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. Cycles can be repeated every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</p><h3>Dosage Modification for Hematologic and Non-Hematologic Toxicities</h3><p class="First">Table 1  displays the recommended Beleodaq dosage modifications for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Base dosage adjustments for thrombocytopenia and neutropenia on platelet and absolute neutrophil nadir (lowest value) counts in the preceding cycle of  therapy.</p><p>Monitor complete blood counts at baseline and weekly. Perform serum chemistry tests, including renal and hepatic functions prior to the start of the first dose of each cycle.</p><h3>Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity</h3><p class="First">Reduce the starting dose of Beleodaq to 750 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Precautions</h3><p class="First">As with other potentially cytotoxic anticancer agents, exercise care in the handling and preparation of solutions prepared with Beleodaq.</p><h3>Reconstitution and Infusion Instructions</h3><p class="First">a) Aseptically reconstitute each vial of Beleodaq by adding 9 mL of Sterile Water for injection, USP, into the Beleodaq vial with a suitable syringe to achieve a concentration of 50 mg of belinostat per mL. Swirl the contents of the vial until there are no visible particles in the resulting solution. The reconstituted product may be stored for up to 12 hours at ambient temperature (15-25°C; 59-77°F).<br/>
<br/>
b) Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the required dosage (based on the 50 mg/mL concentration and the patient’s BSA [m2]) and transfer to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9 % Sodium Chloride injection. The infusion bag with drug solution may be stored at ambient room temperature (15-25°C; 59-77°F) for up to 36 hours including infusion time.<br/>
<br/>
c) Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter. Do not use if cloudiness or particulates are observed.<br/>
<br/>
d) Connect the infusion bag containing drug solution to an infusion set with a 0.22 µm in-line filter for administration.<br/>
<br/>
e) Infuse intravenously over 30 minutes. If infusion site pain or other symptoms potentially attributable to the infusion occur, the infusion time may be extended to 45 minutes.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For injection: 500 mg, lyophilized powder in single-dose vial for reconstitution</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Beleodaq can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and/or anemia; monitor blood counts weekly during treatment, and modify dosage as necessary <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2</span>) and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions(6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, have occurred with Beleodaq.

There are no available data on Beleodaq use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No animal reproduction studies were conducted with Beleodaq. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. </p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of belinostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child<span class="Italics">,</span> advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Beleodaq, and for 2 weeks after the last dose </p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span><br/>
Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Beleodaq.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Contraception</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Females</span><br/>
Beleodaq can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (<span class="Italics">8.1</span>)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Beleodaq and for 6 months after the last dose.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Males</span><br/>
Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Beleodaq and for 3 months after the last dose [see Nonclinical Toxicology (<span class="Italics">13.1</span>)]. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Infertility</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Males</span><br/>
Based on findings from animal studies, Beleodaq may impair male fertility. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (<span class="Italics">13.1</span>)].</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Beleodaq in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In the single-arm trial, 48% of patients (n = 62) were ≥ 65 years of age and 10% of patients (n=13) were ≥ 75 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. The median age of the trial population was 63 years. Patients ≥ 65 years of age had a higher response rate to Beleodaq treatment than patients &lt; 65 years of age (36% versus 16%) while no meaningful differences in response rate were observed between patients ≥ 75 years of age and those &lt; 75 years of age. No clinically meaningful differences in serious adverse reactions were observed in patients based on age (&lt; 65 years compared with ≥ 65 years or &lt; 75 years of age compared with ≥ 75 years of age).</p><h3>Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Belinostat is metabolized in the liver and hepatic impairment is expected to increase exposure to belinostat. Patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)) were excluded from clinical trials.</p><p>There is insufficient data to recommend a dose of Beleodaq in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Belinostat exposure is not altered in patients with Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) &gt; 39 mL/min. There is insufficient data to recommend a dose of Beleodaq in patients with CLcr ≤ 39 mL/min. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage of Beleodaq. There is no antidote for Beleodaq and it is not known if Beleodaq is dialyzable. If an overdose occurs, general supportive measures should be instituted as deemed necessary by the treating physician. The elimination half-life of belinostat is 1.1 hours <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology</span> (<span class="Italics">12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Beleodaq Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Beleodaq is a histone deacetylase inhibitor with a sulfonamide-hydroxamide structure. The chemical name of belinostat is (2E)-<span class="Italics">N</span>-hydroxy-3-[3-(phenylsulfamoyl)phenyl]prop-2-enamide. The structural formula is as follows:</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">15</span>H<span class="Sub">14</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>S and the molecular weight is 318.35 g/mol.</p><p>Belinostat is a white to off-white powder. It is slightly soluble in distilled water (0.14 mg/mL) and polyethylene glycol 400 (about 1.5 mg/mL), and is freely soluble in ethanol (&gt; 200 mg/mL). The pKa values are 7.87 and 8.71 by potentiometry and 7.86 and 8.59 by UV.</p><p>Beleodaq (belinostat) for injection is supplied as a sterile lyophilized yellow powder containing 500 mg belinostat as the active ingredient. Each vial also contains 1000 mg L-Arginine, USP as an inactive ingredient. The drug product is supplied in a single-dose 30 mL clear glass vial with a coated stopper and aluminum crimp seal with “flip-off” cap. Beleodaq is intended for intravenous administration after reconstitution with 9 mL Sterile Water for injection, and the reconstituted solution is further diluted with 250 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection prior to infusion <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><h2>Beleodaq Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Beleodaq is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones and some non-histone proteins. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, belinostat caused the accumulation of acetylated histones and other proteins, inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. Belinostat shows preferential cytotoxicity towards tumor cells compared to normal cells. Belinostat inhibited the enzymatic activity of histone deacetylases at nanomolar concentrations (&lt;250 nM).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>Multiple clinical trials have been conducted with Beleodaq, in many of which ECG data were collected and analyzed by a central laboratory. Analysis of clinical ECG and belinostat plasma concentration data demonstrated no meaningful effect of Beleodaq on cardiac repolarization. None of the trials showed any clinically relevant changes caused by Beleodaq on heart rate, PR duration or QRS duration as measures of autonomic state, atrio-ventricular conduction or depolarization; there were no cases of Torsades de Pointes.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of belinostat were analyzed from pooled data from phase 1/2 clinical studies that used doses of belinostat ranging from 150 to 1200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The total mean plasma clearance and elimination half-life were 1240 mL/min and 1.1 hours, respectively. The total clearance approximates average hepatic blood flow (1500 mL/min), suggesting high hepatic extraction (clearance being flow dependent).</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean belinostat volume of distribution approaches total body water, indicating that belinostat has limited body tissue distribution. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> plasma studies have shown that between 92.9% and 95.8% of belinostat is bound to protein in an equilibrium dialysis assay, and was independent of belinostat plasma concentrations from 500 to 25,000 ng/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Metabolism</p><p>Belinostat is primarily metabolized by hepatic UGT1A1. Strong UGT1A1 inhibitors are expected to increase exposure to belinostat. Belinostat also undergoes hepatic metabolism by CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 enzymes to form belinostat amide and belinostat acid. The enzymes responsible for the formation of methyl belinostat and 3-(anilinosulfonyl)-benzenecarboxylic acid, (3-ASBA) are not known.</p><p>Excretion</p><p>Following a single dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-labelled belinostat (100 μCi, 1500 mg) administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion in patients with recurrent or progressive malignancy (N=6), fecal excretion accounted for a mean (± SD) of 9.7% (± 6.5%) of the administered radioactive belinostat dose over 168 hours. The mean (± SD) of the administered radioactive belinostat dose that was excreted in urine over 168 hours was 84.8% (± 9.8%), of which unchanged belinostat accounted for only 1.7%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>In vitro studies showed belinostat and its metabolites (including belinostat glucuronide, belinostat amide, methyl belinostat) inhibited metabolic activities of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. Other metabolites (3-ASBA and belinostat acid) inhibited CYP2C8.</p><p>In cancer patients, co-administration of Beleodaq (1,000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and warfarin (5 mg), a known CYP2C9 substrate, did not increase the AUC or C<span class="Sub">max</span> of either R- or S-warfarin.</p><p>Belinostat is likely a glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is unlikely to inhibit P-gp.</p><h3>Pharmacogenomics</h3><p class="First">UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity such as the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. Approximately 20% of the black population, 10% of the white population, and 2% of the Asian population are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. Additional reduced function alleles may be more prevalent in specific populations.</p><p>Because belinostat is primarily (80 -90%) metabolized by UGT1A1, the clearance of belinostat could be decreased in patients with reduced UGT1A1 activity (e.g., patients with UGT1A1*28 allele). Reduce the starting dose of Beleodaq to 750 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele to minimize dose limiting toxicities.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with belinostat.</p><p>Belinostat was genotoxic in a bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames assay), an in vitro mouse lymphoma cell mutagenesis assay, and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay.</p><p>Beleodaq may impair male fertility. Fertility studies using belinostat were not conducted. However, belinostat effects on male reproductive organs observed during the 24-week repeat-dose dog toxicology study included reduced organ weights of the testes/epididymides that correlated with a delay in testicular maturation.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL)</span></p><p>In an open-label, single-arm, non-randomized international trial conducted at 62 centers, 129 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL were treated with Beleodaq 1,000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> administered over 30 minutes via IV infusion once daily on Days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. There were 120 patients who had histologically confirmed PTCL by central review evaluable for efficacy. Patients were treated with repeat cycles every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</p><p>Efficacy was evaluated using response rate (complete response and partial response) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) using the International Workshop Criteria (IWC) (Cheson 2007). Response assessments were evaluated every 6 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks until 2 years from the start of study treatment. Duration of response was measured from the first day of documented response to disease progression or death. Response and progression of disease were evaluated by the IRC using the IWC.</p><p>Table 3 summarizes the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population, who were evaluable for efficacy.</p><p>In all evaluable patients (N = 120) treated with Beleodaq, the overall response rate per central review using IWC was 25.8% (n = 31) ( Table 4 ) with rates of 23.4% for PTCL, NOS and 45.5% for AITL, the two largest subtypes enrolled.</p><p>CI=confidence interval, CR=complete response, PR=partial response</p><p>The median duration of response based on the first date of response to disease progression or death was 8.4 months (95% CI: 4.5 – 29.4). Of the responders, the median time to response was 5.6 weeks (range 4.3 - 50.4 weeks). Nine patients (7.5%) were able to proceed to a stem cell transplant after treatment with Beleodaq.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Sup">1</span> OSHA Hazardous Drugs.
