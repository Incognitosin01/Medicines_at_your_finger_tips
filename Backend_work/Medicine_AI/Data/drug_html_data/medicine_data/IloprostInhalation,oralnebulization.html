This is high blood pressure that occurs in the main artery that carries blood from the right side of the heart (the ventricle) to the lungs. When high blood pressure is present, the blood vessels in the lungs are tighter and have smaller openings. This means the right ventricle must work harder to pump enough blood through the lungs. Iloprost is a synthetic (man-made) type of hormone called prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is produced in the lungs and keeps the blood vessels relaxed. People with PAH do not make enough prostacyclin in the lungs. Iloprost will cause the blood vessels to relax, which increases the supply of blood to the lungs and reduces the workload of the heart.</p><p>Iloprost is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using iloprost</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For iloprost, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to iloprost or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of iloprost inhalation in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of iloprost inhalation in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving iloprost inhalation.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking iloprost, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using iloprost with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
