Each 5 mL (one teaspoonful) of the slate-purple-colored, natural strawberry- artificial currant flavored Suspension contains:<br/>
Phenylephrine Tannate           5 mg<br/>
Chlorpheniramine Tannate     4.5 mg</p><p>Other ingredients: benzoic acid, FD&amp;C Blue No.1, FD&amp;C Red No. 3, FD&amp;C Red No. 40, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (see Precautions), flavors (natural and artificial), glycerin, kaolin, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylparaben, pectin, purified water, saccharin sodium, sucrose.</p><h2>Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Rynatan<span class="Sup">®</span> Pediatric Suspension combines the sympathomimetic decongestant effect of phenylephrine with the antihistaminic action of chlorpheniramine.</p><h2>Indications and Usage</h2><p class="First">Rynatan<span class="Sup">®</span> Pediatric Suspension is indicated for symptomatic relief of the coryza and nasal congestion associated with the common cold, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis and other upper respiratory tract conditions. Appropriate therapy should be provided for the primary disease.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Rynatan<span class="Sup">®</span> Pediatric Suspension is contraindicated for newborns, nursing mothers and patients sensitive to any of the ingredients or related compounds.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Use with caution in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, narrow angle glaucoma or prostatic hypertrophy. Use with caution or avoid use in patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. This product contains an antihistamine which may cause drowsiness and may have additive central nervous system (CNS) effects with alcohol or other CNS depressants (e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine), which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible individuals. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">General:</span> Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients. Antihistamines may cause excitation, particularly in children, but their combination with sympathomimetics may cause either mild stimulation or mild sedation.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Information for patients:</span> Caution patients against drinking alcoholic beverages or engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring alertness, such as driving a car or operating machinery while using this product. Patients should be warned not to use this product if they are now taking a prescription monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) (certain drugs for depression, psychiatric or emotional conditions, or Parkinson’s disease), or for 2 weeks after stopping the MAOI drug. If patients are uncertain whether a prescription drug contains an MAOI, they should be instructed to consult a health professional before taking such a product.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drug interactions:</span> MAO inhibitors may prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines and the overall effects of sympathomimetic agents.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:</span> No long term animal studies have been performed with Rynatan<span class="Sup">®</span> Pediatric Suspension.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy:</span> Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C.

The most common have been drowsiness, sedation, dryness of mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal effects. Serious side effects with oral antihistamines or sympathomimetics have been rare.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Signs &amp; symptoms:</span> May vary from CNS depression to stimulation (restlessness to convulsions). Antihistamine overdosage in young children may lead to convulsions and death. Atropine-like signs and symptoms may be prominent.</p><p><span class="Italics">Treatment:</span> Induce vomiting if it has not occurred spontaneously.
