However, due to Eli Lilly and Company Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.</span></span></p><h2>Duloxetine Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer duloxetine delayed-release capsules orally (with or without meals) and swallow whole. Do not chew or crush, and do not open the delayed-release capsule and sprinkle its contents on food or mix with liquids because these actions might affect the enteric coating. If a dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules is missed, take the missed dose as soon as it is remembered. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same time.</p><h3>Dosage for Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dosage in adults with MDD is 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (given either once daily or as 30 mg twice daily). For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed-release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. Periodically reassess to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dosage for such treatment.</p><h3>Dosage for Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Recommended Dosage in Adults Less than 65 Years of Age</span></p><p>For most adults less than 65 years of age with GAD, initiate duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily. For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed-release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg once daily dosage was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit. Nevertheless, if a decision is made to increase the dosage beyond 60 mg once daily, increase dosage in increments of 30 mg once daily. Periodically reassess to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dosage for such treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Recommended Dosage in Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>In geriatric patients with GAD, initiate duloxetine delayed-release capsules at a dosage of 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks before considering an increase to the target dose of 60 mg/day. Thereafter, patients may benefit from doses above 60 mg once daily. If a decision is made to increase the dose beyond 60 mg once daily, increase dose in increments of 30 mg once daily. The maximum dose studied was 120 mg per day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients 7 to 17 Years of Age</span></p><p>Initiate duloxetine delayed-release capsules in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with GAD at a dosage of 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks before considering an increase to 60 mg once daily. The recommended dosage range is 30 to 60 mg once daily. Some patients may benefit from dosages above 60 mg once daily. If a decision is made to increase the dose beyond 60 mg once daily, increase dosage in increments of 30 mg once daily. The maximum dose studied was 120 mg per day.</p><h3>Dosage for Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain in Adults</h3><p class="First">Administer 60 mg once daily in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. There is no evidence that doses higher than 60 mg once daily confer additional significant benefit and the higher dosage is clearly less well tolerated. For patients for whom tolerability is a concern, a lower starting dose may be considered.</p><p>Since diabetes is frequently complicated by renal disease, consider a lower starting dosage and gradual increase in dosage for patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.10)]</span> .</p><h3>Dosage for Treatment of Fibromyalgia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Recommended Dosage in Adults</span></p><p>The recommended duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosage is 60 mg once daily in adults with fibromyalgia. Begin treatment at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed-release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. Some patients may respond to the starting dosage. There is no evidence that dosages greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit, even in patients who do not respond to a 60 mg/day dosage, and higher dosages were associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric use information is approved for Eli Lilly and Company’s CYMBALTA (duloxetine delayed-release capsules). However, due to Eli Lilly and Company's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.</span></p><h3>Dosage for Treatment of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosage is 60 mg once daily in adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Begin treatment at 30 mg once daily for one week, to allow patients to adjust to duloxetine delayed-release capsules before increasing to 60 mg once daily. There is no evidence that higher dosages confer additional benefit, even in patients who do not respond to a 60 mg once daily dosage, and higher dosages are associated with a higher rate of adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies ( 14.6)]</span> .</p><h3>Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment or Severe Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Avoid use in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.9)]</span> .</p><p>Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment, GFR &lt;30 mL/minute <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.10)]</span> .</p><h3>Discontinuing Duloxetine Delayed-Release Capsules</h3><p class="First">Adverse reactions after discontinuation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules, after abrupt or tapered discontinuation, include: dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)]</span> .</p><h3>Switching a Patient to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders</h3><p class="First">At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Conversely, at least 5 days should be allowed after stopping duloxetine delayed-release capsules before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4)]</span> .</p><h3>Use of Duloxetine Delayed-Release Capsules with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue</h3><p class="First">Do not start duloxetine delayed-release capsules in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4)]</span> .</p><p>In some cases, a patient already receiving duloxetine delayed-release capsules therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 5 days or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with duloxetine delayed-release capsules may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]</span> .</p><p>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with duloxetine delayed-release capsules is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]</span> .</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Duloxetine Delayed-Release Capsules, USP are available as delayed release capsules:</p><p>20 mg white or off-white capsules imprinted with “S3”</p><p>30 mg white or off-white and light green capsules imprinted with “S1”</p><p>60 mg white or off-white and buff capsules imprinted with “S3”</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with duloxetine delayed-release capsules or within 5 days of stopping treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]</span> .</p><p>Starting duloxetine delayed-release capsules in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4)]</span> .</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults</h3><p class="First">Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.</p><p>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult duloxetine delayed-release capsules trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about duloxetine delayed-release capsules effect on suicide.</p><p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p>All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</p><p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p><p>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)]</span> for descriptions of the risks of discontinuation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules.</p><p>Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</span></p><p>A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that duloxetine delayed-release capsules are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, in patients treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. These cases have presented as hepatitis with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevation of transaminase levels to more than twenty times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with or without jaundice, reflecting a mixed or hepatocellular pattern of liver injury. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction and should not be resumed unless another cause can be established.</p><p>Cases of cholestatic jaundice with minimal elevation of transaminase levels have also been reported. Other postmarketing reports indicate that elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase have occurred in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.</p><p>Duloxetine delayed-release capsules increased the risk of elevation of serum transaminase levels in development program clinical trials. Liver transaminase elevations resulted in the discontinuation of 0.3% (92/34,756) of duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients. In most patients, the median time to detection of the transaminase elevation was about two months. In adult placebo-controlled trials, for patients with normal and abnormal baseline ALT values, elevation of ALT &gt;3 times the ULN occurred in 1.25% (144/11,496) of duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients compared to 0.45% (39/8716) of placebo-treated patients. In adult placebo-controlled studies using a fixed dose design, there was evidence of a duloxetine delayed-release capsules dose response relationship for ALT and AST elevation of &gt;3 times the ULN and &gt;5 times the ULN, respectively.</p><p>Because it is possible that duloxetine delayed-release capsules and alcohol may interact to cause liver injury or that duloxetine delayed-release capsules may aggravate pre-existing liver disease, duloxetine delayed-release capsules should not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension, Falls and Syncope</h3><p class="First">Orthostatic hypotension, falls, and syncope have been reported in patients treated with the recommended duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of therapy but can occur at any time during duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment, particularly after dose increases. The risk of falling appears to be related to the degree of orthostatic decrease in blood pressure (BP) as well as other factors that may increase the underlying risk of falls.</p><p>In an analysis of patients from all placebo-controlled trials, patients treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules reported a higher rate of falls compared to patients treated with placebo. Risk appears to be related to the presence of orthostatic decrease in BP. The risk of BP decreases may be greater in patients taking concomitant medications that induce orthostatic hypotension (such as antihypertensives) or are potent CYP1A2 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]</span> and in patients taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules at doses above 60 mg daily. Consideration should be given to dose reduction or discontinuation of duloxetine delayed-release capsules in patients who experience symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, falls and/or syncope during duloxetine delayed-release capsules therapy.</p><p>Risk of falling also appeared to be proportional to a patient's underlying risk for falls and appeared to increase steadily with age. As geriatric patients tend to have a higher underlying risk for falls due to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as use of multiple medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including fractures and hospitalizations have been reported with duloxetine delayed-release capsules use <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including duloxetine delayed-release capsules, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).</p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.</p><p>The concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules with MAOI antidepressants is contraindicated. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9, 2.10) and Contraindications ( 4)]</span> .</p><p>If concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including duloxetine delayed-release capsules, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. A post-marketing study showed a higher incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in mothers taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Other bleeding events related to SSRI and SNRI use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including duloxetine delayed-release capsules, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. A post-marketing study showed a higher incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in mothers taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Other bleeding events related to SSRI and SNRI use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation . Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.4)]</span> .</span></p><h3>Severe Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe skin reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), can occur with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. The reporting rate of SJS associated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules use exceeds the general population background incidence rate for this serious skin reaction (1 to 2 cases per million person years). The reporting rate is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting.</p><p>Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued at the first appearance of blisters, peeling rash, mucosal erosions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity if no other etiology can be identified.</p><h3>Discontinuation Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Following abrupt or tapered discontinuation in adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following symptoms occurred at 1% or greater and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.</p><p>During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe.</p><p>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8)]</span> .</p><h3>Activation of Mania/Hypomania</h3><p class="First">In adult placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, activation of mania or hypomania was reported in 0.1% (4/3779) of duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients and 0.04% (1/2536) of placebo-treated patients. No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in DPNP, GAD, fibromyalgia, or chronic musculoskeletal pain placebo-controlled trials. Activation of mania or hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with mood disorders who were treated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. As with these other agents, duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.</p><h3>Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including duloxetine delayed-release capsules may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Duloxetine delayed-release capsules have not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder, and such patients were excluded from clinical studies. In adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.02% (3/12,722) of patients treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules and 0.01% (1/9513) of patients treated with placebo. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of a seizure disorder.</p><h3>Increases in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">In adult placebo-controlled clinical trials across the approved adult populations from baseline to endpoint, duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment was associated with mean increases of 0.5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 0.8 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure compared to mean decreases of 0.6 mm Hg systolic and 0.3 mm Hg diastolic in placebo-treated patients. There was no significant difference in the frequency of sustained (3 consecutive visits) elevated blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study designed to evaluate the effects of duloxetine delayed-release capsules on various parameters, including blood pressure at supratherapeutic doses with an accelerated dose titration, there was evidence of increases in supine blood pressure at doses up to 200 mg twice daily (approximately 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage).

Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored and the dose of the TCA may need to be reduced if a TCA is co-administered with duloxetine delayed-release capsules.

In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported with duloxetine delayed-release capsules use and appeared to be reversible when duloxetine delayed-release capsules was discontinued. Geriatric patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5)]</span> . Discontinuation of CYMBALTA should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have been associated with hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness</h3><p class="First">Clinical experience with duloxetine delayed-release capsules in patients with concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. There is no information on the effect that alterations in gastric motility may have on the stability of duloxetine delayed-release capsules' enteric coating. In extremely acidic conditions, duloxetine delayed-release capsules, unprotected by the enteric coating, may undergo hydrolysis to form naphthol. Caution is advised in using duloxetine delayed-release capsules in patients with conditions that may slow gastric emptying (e.g., some diabetics).</p><p>Duloxetine delayed-release capsules have not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable coronary artery disease.

In the 12-week acute treatment phase of these studies, duloxetine delayed-release capsules were associated with a small increase in mean fasting blood glucose as compared to placebo. In the extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, mean fasting blood glucose increased by 12 mg/dL in the duloxetine delayed-release capsules group and decreased by 11.5 mg/dL in the routine care group. HbA <span class="Sub">1c</span> increased by 0.5% in the duloxetine delayed-release capsules group and by 0.2% in the routine care group.</p><h3>Urinary Hesitation and Retention</h3><p class="First">Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance. If symptoms of urinary hesitation develop during treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules, consideration should be given to the possibility that they might be drug-related.</p><p>In post marketing experience, cases of urinary retention have been observed. In some instances of urinary retention associated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules use, hospitalization and/or catheterization has been needed.</p><h3>Risk of Allergic Reaction Due to Tartrazine</h3><p class="First">Duloxetine delayed-release capsules 30 mg contain FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally related to duloxetine delayed-release capsules therapy and not mentioned elsewhere in labeling include: acute pancreatitis, anaphylactic reaction, aggression and anger (particularly early in treatment or after treatment discontinuation), angioneurotic edema, angle-closure glaucoma, colitis (microscopic or unspecified), cutaneous vasculitis (sometimes associated with systemic involvement), extrapyramidal disorder, galactorrhea, gynecological bleeding, hallucinations, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactinemia, hypersensitivity, hypertensive crisis, muscle spasm, rash, restless legs syndrome, seizures upon treatment discontinuation, supraventricular arrhythmia, tinnitus (upon treatment discontinuation), trismus, and urticaria.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 are responsible for duloxetine metabolism.</p><h3>Inhibitors of CYP1A2</h3><p class="First">When duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg was co-administered with fluvoxamine 100 mg, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, to male subjects (n=14) duloxetine AUC was increased approximately 6-fold, the C <span class="Sub">max</span> was increased about 2.5-fold, and duloxetine t <span class="Sub">1/2</span> was increased approximately 3-fold. Other drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 metabolism include cimetidine and quinolone antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12)]</span> .</p><h3>Inhibitors of CYP2D6</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of duloxetine delayed-release capsules(40 mg once daily) with paroxetine (20 mg once daily) increased the concentration of duloxetine AUC by about 60%, and greater degrees of inhibition are expected with higher doses of paroxetine. Similar effects would be expected with other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, quinidine) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12)]</span> .</p><h3>Dual Inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 40 mg twice daily with fluvoxamine 100 mg, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, to CYP2D6 poor metabolizer subjects (n=14) resulted in a 6-fold increase in duloxetine AUC and C <span class="Sub">max</span>.</p><h3>Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)</h3><p class="First">Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are co-administered with warfarin. Concomitant administration of warfarin (2-9 mg once daily) under steady state conditions with duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 or 120 mg once daily for up to 14 days in healthy subjects (n=15) did not significantly change INR from baseline (mean INR changes ranged from 0.05 to +0.07). The total warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) pharmacokinetics (AUC <span class="Sub">τ,ss</span>, C <span class="Sub">max,ss</span> or t <span class="Sub">max,ss</span>) for both R- and S-warfarin were not altered by duloxetine. Because of the potential effect of duloxetine on platelets, patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when duloxetine delayed-release capsules are initiated or discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)]</span> .</p><h3>Lorazepam</h3><p class="First">Under steady-state conditions for duloxetine delayed-release capsules(60 mg Q 12 hours) and lorazepam (2 mg Q 12 hours), the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine were not affected by co-administration.</p><h3>Temazepam</h3><p class="First">Under steady-state conditions for duloxetine delayed-release capsules(20 mg qhs) and temazepam (30 mg qhs), the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine were not affected by co-administration.</p><h3>Drugs that Affect Gastric Acidity</h3><p class="First">Duloxetine delayed-release capsules have an enteric coating that resists dissolution until reaching a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the pH exceeds 5.5. In extremely acidic conditions, duloxetine delayed-release capsules, unprotected by the enteric coating, may undergo hydrolysis to form naphthol. Caution is advised in using duloxetine delayed-release capsules in patients with conditions that may slow gastric emptying (e.g., some diabetics). Drugs that raise the gastrointestinal pH may lead to an earlier release of duloxetine. However, co-administration of duloxetine delayed-release capsules with aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids (51 mEq) or duloxetine delayed-release capsules with famotidine, had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose. It is unknown whether the concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors affects duloxetine absorption <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14)]</span> .</p><h3>Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> drug interaction studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce CYP1A2 activity. Therefore, an increase in the metabolism of CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine) resulting from induction is not anticipated, although clinical studies of induction have not been performed. Duloxetine is an inhibitor of the CYP1A2 isoform in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, and in two clinical studies the average (90% confidence interval) increase in theophylline AUC was 7% (1%-15%) and 20% (13%-27%) when co-administered with duloxetine delayed-release capsules(60 mg twice daily).</p><h3>Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</h3><p class="First">Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When duloxetine delayed-release capsules were administered (at a dose of 60 mg twice daily) in conjunction with a single 50 mg dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12)]</span> .</p><h3>Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C9</h3><p class="First">Results of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not inhibit activity.

The increased risk appears to be proportional to a patient's underlying risk for falls. Underlying risk appears to increase steadily with age. As geriatric patients tend to have a higher prevalence of risk factors for falls such as medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself on falls during duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including bone fractures and hospitalizations have been reported with duloxetine delayed-release capsules use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine after a single dose of 40 mg were compared in healthy elderly females (65 to 77 years) and healthy middle-age females (32 to 50 years). There was no difference in the C <span class="Sub">max</span>, but the AUC of duloxetine was somewhat (about 25%) higher and the half-life about 4 hours longer in the elderly females. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the typical values for clearance decrease by approximately 1% for each year of age between 25 to 75 years of age; but age as a predictive factor only accounts for a small percentage of between-patient variability. Dosage adjustment based on the age of the adult patient is not necessary.</p><h3>Gender</h3><p class="First">Duloxetine's half-life is similar in men and women. Dosage adjustment based on gender is not necessary.</p><h3>Smoking Status</h3><p class="First">Duloxetine bioavailability (AUC) appears to be reduced by about one-third in smokers.

After a single 60 mg dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules, C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were approximately 100% greater in patients with ESRD receiving chronic intermittent hemodialysis than in subjects with normal renal function. The elimination half-life, however, was similar in both groups. The AUCs of the major circulating metabolites, 4-hydroxy duloxetine glucuronide and 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy duloxetine sulfate, largely excreted in urine, were approximately 7- to 9-fold higher and would be expected to increase further with multiple dosing. Population PK analyses suggest that mild to moderate degrees of renal impairment (estimated CrCl 30-80 mL/min) have no significant effect on duloxetine apparent clearance <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14)]</span> .</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">In animal studies, duloxetine did not demonstrate barbiturate-like (depressant) abuse potential.</p><p>While duloxetine delayed-release capsules have not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, there was no indication of drug-seeking behavior in the clinical trials. However, it is not possible to predict on the basis of premarketing experience the extent to which a CNS active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of duloxetine delayed-release capsules (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">In drug dependence studies, duloxetine did not demonstrate dependence-producing potential in rats.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">In postmarketing experience, fatal outcomes have been reported for acute duloxetine delayed-release capsules overdoses, primarily with mixed overdoses, but also with duloxetine delayed-release capsules only, including 1000 mg of duloxetine delayed-release capsules (approximately 8.3 times the maximum recommended dosage). Signs and symptoms of overdose (duloxetine delayed-release capsules alone or with mixed drugs) included somnolence, coma, serotonin syndrome, seizures, syncope, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, and vomiting.</p><h3>Management of Overdose</h3><p class="First">There is no specific antidote to a duloxetine delayed-release capsules overdosage, but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment (such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered.</p><p>In case of acute overdose with duloxetine delayed-release capsules, treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdose with any drug, such as assuring an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation and monitoring cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. Induction of emesis is not recommended.</p><p>Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption of duloxetine from the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of activated charcoal has been shown to decrease duloxetine AUC and C <span class="Sub">max</span> by an average of one-third, although some patients had a limited effect of activated charcoal. Due to the large volume of distribution of duloxetine, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.</p><p>In managing overdose, the possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. A specific caution involves patients who overdose with duloxetine delayed-release capsules and tricyclic antidepressants. In such a case, decreased clearance of the parent tricyclic and/or its active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4) and Drug Interactions ( 7)]</span> .</p><p>Consider contacting a poison control center (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org) for additional information on the treatment of overdosage.</p><h2>Duloxetine Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Duloxetine Delayed-Release Capsules, USP are selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) for oral administration. Its chemical designation is (+)-( <span class="Italics">S</span>)- <span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl-γ-(1-naphthyloxy)-2-thiophenepropylamine hydrochloride. The empirical formula is C <span class="Sub">18</span>H <span class="Sub">19</span>NOS•HCl, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 333.88. The structural formula is:</p><p>Duloxetine hydrochloride is a white to slightly brownish white solid, which is slightly soluble in water.</p><p>Each capsule contains enteric-coated pellets of 20, 30, or 60 mg of duloxetine (equivalent to 22.4, 33.7, or 67.3 mg of duloxetine hydrochloride, respectively). These enteric-coated pellets are designed to prevent degradation of the drug in the acidic environment of the stomach. Inactive ingredients include gelatin, hypromellose, hypromellose acetate succinate, polysorbate 80, strong ammonia solution, sucrose, sugar spheres, talc, titanium dioxide, triethyl citrate and water, the 20 mg capsule also contains ink black SW9008, the 30 mg capsule also contains ink black SW9008, FD&amp;C Blue 1, FD&amp;C Yellow 6 and FD&amp;C Yellow 5, the 60 mg capsule also contains ink blue SB6008, ferric oxide yellow.</p><h2>Duloxetine Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Although the exact mechanisms of the antidepressant, central pain inhibitory and anxiolytic actions of duloxetine in humans are unknown, these actions are believed to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Preclinical studies have shown that duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Duloxetine does not inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).</p><p>Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15)]</span> .</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 160 mg and 200 mg administered twice daily (2.7 and 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage, respectively) to steady state was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, two-way crossover study in 117 healthy female adult subjects. No QT interval prolongation was detected. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules appears to be associated with concentration-dependent but not clinically meaningful QT shortening.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>After oral duloxetine delayed-release capsules administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hour lag until absorption begins (T <span class="Sub">lag</span>), with maximal plasma concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hour delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effect of Food:</span> Food does not affect the C <span class="Sub">max</span> of duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (&gt;90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α <span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Biotransformation and disposition of duloxetine in humans have been determined following oral administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled duloxetine. Duloxetine comprises about 3% of the total radiolabeled material in the plasma, indicating that it undergoes extensive metabolism to numerous metabolites. The major biotransformation pathways for duloxetine involve oxidation of the naphthyl ring followed by conjugation and further oxidation. Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 catalyze the oxidation of the naphthyl ring <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Metabolites found in plasma include 4-hydroxy duloxetine glucuronide and 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy duloxetine sulfate.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Many additional metabolites have been identified in urine, some representing only minor pathways of elimination. Only trace (&lt;1% of the dose) amounts of unchanged duloxetine are present in the urine. Most (about 70%) of the duloxetine dose appears in the urine as metabolites of duloxetine; about 20% is excreted in the feces. Duloxetine undergoes extensive metabolism, but the major circulating metabolites have not been shown to contribute significantly to the pharmacologic activity of duloxetine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Duloxetine steady-state plasma concentration was comparable in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age and adult patients. The average steady-state duloxetine concentration was approximately 30% lower in this pediatric population relative to adult patients. The model-predicted duloxetine steady state plasma concentrations in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age were mostly within the concentration range observed in adult patients and did not exceed the concentration range in adults.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Duloxetine was administered in the diet to mice and rats for 2 years.</p><p>In female mice receiving duloxetine at 140 mg/kg/day (3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 120 mg/day given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis), there was an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. The no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day (1 time the MRHD given to children).

All patients in both trials fulfilled the ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for classification of idiopathic OA of the knee. Randomization was stratified by the patients' baseline NSAIDs-use status.</p><p>Patients assigned to duloxetine delayed-release capsules started treatment in both trials at a dose of 30 mg once daily for one week. After the first week, the dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules was increased to 60 mg once daily. After 7 weeks of treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily, in Study OA-1 patients with sub-optimal response to treatment (&lt;30% pain reduction) and tolerated duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily had their dose increased to 120 mg. However, in Study OA-2, all patients, regardless of their response to treatment after 7 weeks, were re-randomized to either continue receiving duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily or have their dosage increased to 120 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial. Patients in the placebo treatment groups in both trials received a matching placebo for the entire duration of trials. For both trials, efficacy analyses were conducted using 13-week data from the combined duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg and 120 mg once daily treatment groups compared to the placebo group.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Study OA-1:</span> Two hundred fifty-six patients (N=128 on duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=128 on placebo) enrolled and 204 (80%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules had significantly greater pain reduction than patients taking placebo. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were differences in treatment outcomes as a function of NSAIDs use.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Study OA-2:</span> Two hundred thirty-one patients (N=111 on duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=120 on placebo) enrolled and 173 (75%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules did not show a significantly greater pain reduction than patients taking placebo.</p><p>In Study OA-1, for various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 10 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%.
