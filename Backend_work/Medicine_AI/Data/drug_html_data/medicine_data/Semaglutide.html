Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p><b>Rybelsus</b> (oral) is taken by mouth. Take Rybelsus on an empty stomach when you first wake up, at least 30 minutes before you eat or drink anything. Take this medicine with no more than 4 ounces of water. Swallow the tablet whole and do not crush, chew, or break it.</p><p><b>Rybelsus</b> works best if you eat 30 to 60 minutes after taking it.</p><p>Ozempic (injection) is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with Ozempic. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine looks cloudy or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Ozempic is usually given once per week at any time of the day, with or without a meal. If you want to change your weekly injection day, wait at least 2 days after your most recent injection before giving another one.</p><p>Your healthcare provider will show you where on your body to inject Ozempic. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row.</p><p>You may have low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> and feel very hungry, dizzy, irritable, confused, anxious, or shaky. To quickly treat hypoglycemia, eat or drink a fast-acting source of sugar (fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda).</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe a glucagon injection kit in case you have severe hypoglycemia. Be sure your family or close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>Call your doctor if you have ongoing vomiting or diarrhea, or if you are sweating more than usual. You can easily become dehydrated while taking semaglutide.

Follow your doctor's instructions very closely.</p><p>Store <b>Rybelsus</b> tablets in their original package at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.</p><p><b>Storing unopened Ozempic injection pens:</b> Store in the refrigerator. <b>Do not freeze semaglutide</b>, and throw away the medication if it has become frozen. Do not use an unopened injection pen if the expiration date on the label has passed.</p><p>Storing after your first use: You may keep an "in-use" injection pen in the refrigerator or at room temperature. Protect the pen from heat and sunlight. Remove the needle before storing an injection pen, and keep the cap on the pen when not in use. Throw the injection pen away 56 days after the first use.</p><p>Use a disposable needle only once. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes. Use a puncture-proof "sharps" disposal container (ask your pharmacist where to get one and how to throw it away). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>For Rybelsus: Skip the missed dose and use your next dose at the regular time. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><p>For Ozempic: Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if you are more than 5 days late for the dose.
