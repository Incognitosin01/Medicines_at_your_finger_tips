</ul><p>glaucoma;</p><p>low levels of potassium in your blood; or</p><p>asthma or a sulfite allergy.</p><p>It is not known whether fenoldopam will harm an unborn baby. However, having high blood pressure during pregnancy may cause complications such as diabetes or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating hypertension may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while you are receiving fenoldopam.</p><p>In an emergency, you may not be able to tell caregivers if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Make sure any doctor caring for your pregnancy or your baby knows you received  fenoldopam.</p><h2>How is fenoldopam given?</h2><p>Fenoldopam is given as an infusion into a vein.

Follow your doctor's instructions about how to keep your blood pressure from getting too high.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive fenoldopam as a continuous infusion in an emergency setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  fenoldopam is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.
