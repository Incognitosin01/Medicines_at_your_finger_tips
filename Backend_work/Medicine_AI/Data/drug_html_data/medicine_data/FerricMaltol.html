Assess iron parameters prior to and during therapy; do not use in patients with iron overload or receiving IV iron therapy.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Inflammatory bowel disease: Avoid use in patients with an active inflammatory bowel disease flare; may increase risk of GI tract inflammation.</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</b></i></p><p>• Altered medication absorption: May affect absorption of other medications. The manufacturer's labeling recommends separating the administration of ferric maltol and other oral medications where reductions in bioavailability may affect safety and effectiveness by ≥4 hours.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Elderly: Anemia in elderly patients is often caused by "anemia of chronic disease" or associated with inflammation rather than blood loss. Iron stores are usually normal or increased, with a serum ferritin &gt;50 ng/mL and a decreased total iron binding capacity. Hence, the "anemia of chronic disease" is not secondary to iron deficiency but the inability of the reticuloendothelial system to reclaim available iron stores.</p><p>• Pediatric: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age. Keep this product out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose call the poison control center immediately.</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Oral iron formulations: Immediate-release oral iron products are preferred for treatment of iron deficiency anemia; enteric-coated and slow/sustained-release preparations are not desired due to poor absorption (Hershko 2014; Liu 2012).</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Duration of therapy: Administration of iron for &gt;6 months should be avoided except in patients with continuous bleeding or menorrhagia.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Hemoglobin and hematocrit; consider additional tests such as RBC count, RBC indices, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, total iron-binding capacity, serum iron concentration, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration (CDC 1998).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Iron and maltol are absorbed separately following maternal ingestion; the fetus is not expected to be exposed to the ferric maltol complex.</p><p>Maternal iron requirements increase during pregnancy. Adequate iron concentrations to the fetus can be maintained regardless of maternal iron status, except in severe cases of anemia (IOM 2001). Untreated iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in a pregnant female may be associated with adverse events, including low birth weight, preterm birth, or increased perinatal mortality (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2019]; IOM 2001).</p><p>In general, treatment of iron deficiency or IDA in pregnancy is the same as in nonpregnant females (USPSTF [Siu 2015]). Ferrous salts are preferred over ferric salts for the oral management of IDA in pregnancy due to better absorption and bioavailability (BSH [Pavord 2019]). Iron supplementation is recommended for 3 months once hemoglobin is within the normal range, and for at least 6 months postpartum to replenish maternal iron stores (BSH [Pavord 2019]; FIGO 2019). The majority of studies note iron therapy improves maternal hematologic parameters; however, information related to clinical outcomes in the mother and neonate is limited (FIGO 2019; Peña-Rosas 2015; Reveiz 2011; USPSTF [Siu 2015]). Oral preparations are generally sufficient; however, parenteral iron therapy may be used in females who cannot tolerate or will not take oral iron, in cases of severe iron deficiency, or when malabsorption is present (ACOG 95 2008; BSH [Pavord 2019]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat low iron levels.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
