Each mL of BP 7% Wash contains 70mg of benzoyl peroxide in an emulsion base consisting of: Aloe Barbedensis Leaf Extract, Carbomer, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, PEG-100 Stearate, Glycerin, Camellia Oleifera Leaf (Green Tea) Extract, Octoxynol-13, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, PPG-14 Palmeth-60 Hexyl Dicarbamate, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Benzyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Triethanolamine.<br/></p><p>Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent that possesses antibacterial properties and is classified as a keratolytic.<br/></p><h2>CLINCIAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">The exact mechanism of action of benzoyl peroxide in acne vulgaris is not known. Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial agent with demonstrated activity against Propionibacterium acnes. This action, combined with the mild keratolytic effect of benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is metabolized to benzoic acid and excreted as benzoate in the urine. There is no evidence of systemic toxicity in humans caused by benzoyl peroxide.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</p><p>Based upon all available evidence, benzoyl peroxide is not considered to be a carcinogen. However, data from a study using mice known to be highly susceptible to cancer suggest that benzoyl peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of the findings is not known. Benzoyl peroxide has not been found to be mutagenic (Ames Test). There are no published data indicating impairment of fertility.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">BP 7% Wash is supplied as follows:<br/>
