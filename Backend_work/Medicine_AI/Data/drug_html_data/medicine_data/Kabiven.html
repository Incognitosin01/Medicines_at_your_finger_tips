<li>Kabiven and Perikabiven are each indicated as a source of calories, protein, electrolytes and essential fatty acids for adult patients requiring parenteral nutrition when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated.

<li>Kabiven is indicated for intravenous infusion into a central vein.</li>
<li>Perikabiven is indicated for intravenous infusion into a peripheral or central vein.</li>

<li>Deaths in preterm infants have been reported in literature.</li>
<li>Autopsy findings included intravascular fat accumulation in the lungs.</li>
