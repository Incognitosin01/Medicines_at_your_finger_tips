Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Deferoxamine is sometimes injected into a muscle. Deferoxamine may also be given over 8 to 24 hours using an infusion pump attached to a catheter placed under your skin or into a vein. A healthcare provider may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Deferoxamine must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. When using injections by yourself, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. It is best to use deferoxamine within 3 hours after mixing it. Do not use if the medicine has changed colors or has particles in it.
