The colchicine in probenecid and colchicine also helps to prevent gout attacks. Although colchicine may also be used to relieve an attack of gout, this requires more colchicine than this combination medicine contains. Probenecid and colchicine combination does not cure gout. Probenecid and colchicine will help prevent gout attacks only as long as you continue to take it.</p><p>Probenecid and colchicine combination is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using probenecid and colchicine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For probenecid and colchicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to probenecid and colchicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on this combination medicine have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information about its use in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Elderly people are especially sensitive to the effects of colchicine. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment.</p><p>There is no specific information comparing use of probenecid in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking probenecid and colchicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using probenecid and colchicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

<li>Alcohol abuse or</li>
<li>Blood disease or</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of probenecid and colchicine</h2><p>If probenecid and colchicine upsets your stomach, it may be taken with food. If this does not work, an antacid may be taken. If stomach upset (nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or stomach pain) continues, check with your doctor.</p><p>Take probenecid and colchicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it and do not take it more often than your doctor ordered. The colchicine in this combination medicine may cause serious side effects if too much is taken.</p><p>After you begin to take probenecid and colchicine, gout attacks may continue to occur for a while. However, if you take probenecid and colchicine regularly as directed by your doctor, the attacks will gradually become less frequent and less painful than before. After you have been taking probenecid and colchicine for several months, they may stop completely.</p><p>Probenecid and colchicine will help prevent gout attacks but it will not relieve an attack that has already started. Even if you take another medicine for gout attacks, continue to take probenecid and colchicine also.</p><p>When you first begin taking probenecid and colchicine, the amount of uric acid in the kidneys is greatly increased. This may cause kidney stones or other kidney problems in some people. To help prevent this, your doctor may want you to drink at least 10 to 12 full glasses (8 ounces each) of fluids each day, or to take another medicine to make your urine less acid. It is important that you follow your doctor's instructions very carefully.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of probenecid and colchicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of probenecid and colchicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

</ul><p>Taking aspirin or other salicylates may lessen the effects of the probenecid in this combination medicine. This will depend on the dose of aspirin or other salicylate that you take, and on how often you take it. Also, drinking large amounts of alcoholic beverages may increase the chance of stomach problems and may increase the amount of uric acid in your blood. Therefore, do not take aspirin or other salicylates or drink alcoholic beverages while you are taking probenecid and colchicine, unless you have first checked with your doctor.</p><p>For patients taking 4 tablets or more of probenecid and colchicine a day:</p><ul>
