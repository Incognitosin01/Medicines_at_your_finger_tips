Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands to help regulate the salt and water balance in your body.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use triamterene if you have severe kidney or liver disease, urination problems, or high levels of potassium in your blood. You should not take triamterene if you also take potassium supplements, or other diuretics such as amiloride or spironolactone.</p><p><b>Call your doctor right away if you have signs of hyperkalemia (high potassium),</b> such as nausea, irregular heartbeats, weakness, or loss of movement. High potassium may be more likely in older adults, or in people with kidney disease, diabetes, or severe illness.</p><p>You should not take triamterene if you also take potassium supplements, or other diuretics such as amiloride or spironolactone.</p><p><b>Call your doctor right away if you have signs of hyperkalemia (high potassium),</b> such as nausea, slow or unusual heart rate, weakness, or loss of movement. You may be more likely to have high potassium if you have kidney disease, diabetes, a severe illness, or if you an older adult.</p><p>Avoid drinking alcohol, which can increase some of the side effects of triamterene.</p><p>Avoid a diet high in salt. Too much salt will cause your body to retain water and can make this medication less effective.</p><p>Do not use salt substitutes or low-sodium milk products that contain potassium. These products could cause your potassium levels to get too high while you are taking triamterene.</p><p>Avoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise and in hot weather. Follow your doctor's instructions about the type and amount of liquids you should drink. In some cases, drinking too much liquid can be as unsafe as not drinking enough.</p><p>Triamterene can cause side effects that may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be awake and alert.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use triamterene if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>severe kidney disease, or if you are unable to urinate;</p>
