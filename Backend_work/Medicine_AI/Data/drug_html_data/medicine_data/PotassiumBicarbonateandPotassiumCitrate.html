Separating antacid and mesalamine administration, and/or using lower antacid doses may be adequate means of avoiding this interaction.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Methenamine: Antacids may diminish the therapeutic effect of Methenamine.  Management: Consider avoiding this combination if possible. Antacids may decrease the therapeutic effects of methenamine; sodium bicarbonate is of most concern. If coadministering methenamine and antacids, monitor for decreased methenamine efficacy.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Methylphenidate: Antacids may increase the absorption of Methylphenidate. Specifically, antacids may interfere with the normal release of drug from the extended-release capsules (Ritalin LA brand), which could result in both increased absorption (early) and decreased delayed absorption. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Multivitamins/Minerals (with ADEK, Folate, Iron): Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Multivitamins/Minerals (with ADEK, Folate, Iron). Specifically, antacids may decrease the absorption of orally administered iron.

The combined use of these two agents may result in metabolic alkalosis and/or loss of efficacy of the exchange resin.  Management: To minimize this interaction, consider: a)separating doses by 2 or more hours; b)rectal administration of the exchange resin; or c)alternatives to antacids. Monitor for metabolic alkalosis and attenuation of SPS effects. Avoid magnesium hydroxide.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Sotalol: Antacids may decrease the serum concentration of Sotalol.
