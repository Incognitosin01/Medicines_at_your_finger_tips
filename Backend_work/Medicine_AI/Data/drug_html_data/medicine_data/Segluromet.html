Ertugliflozin works by helping the kidneys get rid of glucose from your bloodstream. Metformin works by helping your liver release lower amounts of sugar into your blood.</p><p>Segluromet is used together with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Segluromet is not for treating type 1 diabetes.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Segluromet if you have severe kidney disease, if you are on dialysis, or if you have diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p>Ertugliflozin may increase your risk of lower leg amputation, especially if you have had a prior amputation, a foot ulcer, heart disease, circulation problems, or nerve damage.</p><p>If you need to have any type of x-ray or CT scan using a dye that is injected into your veins, you may need to temporarily stop taking Segluromet.</p><p><b>Ertugliflozin can cause serious infections in the penis or vagina.</b> Get medical help right away if you have burning, itching, odor, discharge, pain, tenderness, redness or swelling of the genital or rectal area, fever, or if you don't feel well.</p><p>You may develop lactic acidosis, a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood.

Even if your blood sugar is normal, contact your doctor if a urine test shows that you have ketones in the urine.</p><p>You may have low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> and feel very hungry, dizzy, irritable, confused, anxious, or shaky.

Be sure your family or close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>This medicine can cause unusual results with certain lab tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using Segluromet.</p><p>Segluromet is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care.
