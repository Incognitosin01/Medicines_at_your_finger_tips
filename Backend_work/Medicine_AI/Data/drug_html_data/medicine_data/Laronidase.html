Some people lack this enzyme because of a genetic disorder. Laronidase helps replace this missing enzyme in such people.</p><p>Laronidase is used to treat some of the symptoms of a genetic condition called mucopolysaccharidosis (MYOO-koe-pol-ee-SAK-a-rye-DOE-sis) or MPS I, also called Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, or Scheie syndrome.</p><p>MPS I is a metabolic disorder in which the body lacks the enzyme needed to break down certain substances. These substances can build up in the body, causing enlarged organs, abnormal bone structure, changes in facial features, breathing problems, heart problems, vision or hearing loss, and changes in mental or physical abilities.</p><p>Laronidase may improve breathing and walking ability in people with this condition. However, <b>this medication is not a cure for MPS I.</b></p><p>Laronidase may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>An allergic reaction may occur during or shortly after infusion of  laronidase. <b>Tell your caregivers or get emergency medical help right away if you have any signs of a severe allergic reaction,</b> such as sweating, chest discomfort, trouble breathing, pale skin, blue lips or fingernails, and feeling like you might pass out.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Your laronidase infusion may be delayed if you have a fever or cold symptoms.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>breathing problems;</p>

</ul><p>breathing problems;</p><p>heart disease; or</p><p>sleep apnea, and you use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>It is not known whether laronidase will harm an unborn baby. However, MPS symptoms can get worse during pregnancy and may cause medical problems in both mother and baby. The benefit of treating MPS may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>Your name may need to be listed on an MPS I Registry while you are using this medicine. The purpose of this registry is to track the progression of this disorder and the effects that laronidase has on long-term treatment of MPS I. The registry also tracks the effects of laronidase on a baby if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><h2>How is laronidase given?</h2><p>Laronidase is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Laronidase is usually given once per week.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have been sick with a fever or cold. You may need to wait until you get better before receiving your dose of laronidase.</p><p>Laronidase must be given slowly, and the infusion can take up to 4 hours to complete.</p><p>An hour before each injection, you will be given other medications to help prevent a serious allergic reaction.</p><p>After each injection, you will be watched closely to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction.</p><p>Your doctor will need to check your progress on a regular basis.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your laronidase injection.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since laronidase is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving laronidase?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Laronidase side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>An allergic reaction may occur during or shortly after infusion of  laronidase (up to 3 hours later). <b>Tell your caregivers or get emergency medical help right away if you have any signs of a severe allergic reaction,</b> such as:</p><ul>
