Some vitamins and minerals can be harmful if taken in large doses. You may need to use a specially formulated prenatal vitamin.</p><h2>How should I take multivitamins and minerals?</h2><p>Use exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor.</p><p>Never take more than the recommended dose of multivitamins and minerals.</p><p>Read the label of any vitamin and mineral product you take to make sure you are aware of what it contains.</p><p>Take this medicine with a full glass of water.
