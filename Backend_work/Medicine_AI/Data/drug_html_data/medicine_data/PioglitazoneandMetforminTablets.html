</ul><p><span class="Bold">Lactic Acidosis</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> .</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].</span></span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets</span><span class="Bold">and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting.

</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Pioglitazone and Metformin Tablets</h2><p class="First">Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both pioglitazone and metformin is appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Important Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin.  Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.</p><p>Use caution in patients with liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h2>Pioglitazone and Metformin Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommendations for All Patients</h3><p class="First">Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin.</p><p>If therapy with a combination tablet containing pioglitazone and metformin is considered appropriate the recommended starting dose is:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,</li>
<li>  for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I or Class II congestive heart failure: 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,</li>
<li>  for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once or twice daily (depending on the dose of metformin already being taken) and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,</li>
<li>  for patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,</li>
<li>  for patients who are changing from combination therapy of pioglitazone plus metformin as separate tablets: pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be taken at doses that are as close as possible to the dose of pioglitazone and metformin already being taken.</li>
</ul><p class="First">Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets may be titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 45 mg of pioglitazone and 2550 mg of metformin.</p><p>Metformin doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day.</p><p>After initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Assess renal function prior to initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and periodically thereafter.</p><p>Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p>Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>is not recommended.</p><p>In patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy.</p><p>Discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span><span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h3>Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of pioglitazone (one of the ingredients in pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets) and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 15 mg/850 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures</h3><p class="First">Discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedures in patients with eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Congestive Heart Failure</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.  Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride must be considered <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning</span>, <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Lactic Acidosis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lactic Acidosis</span></span></p><p>There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio;metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.</p><p>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. In pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</p><p>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</p><p>For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an eGFR.</li>
<li>Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>. Initiation of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>.</li>
<li>Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.</li>
<li>In patients taking pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>The concomitant use of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation (e.g. cationic drugs) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Age 65 or Greater</span></p><p>The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Radiological Studies with Contrast</span></p><p>Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable.</p><p><span class="Bold">Surgery and Other Procedures</span></p><p>Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypoxic States</span></p><p>Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excessive Alcohol Intake</span></p><p>Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.</p><h3>Edema</h3><p class="First">In controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose related <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received.</p><p>Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with edema.  Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>, <span class="Italics">and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p>Hypoglycemia can also occur when caloric intake is deficient or when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplement. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.</p><h3>Hepatic Effects</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride therapy.</p><p>In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be initiated with caution.</p><p>Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.</p><p>Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride can be used with caution.</p><h3>Urinary Bladder Tumors</h3><p class="First">Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% Cl: 0.59 to 1.72]).</p><p>Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did.</p><p>A large prospective 10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% Cl 0.89 to 1.26]).</p><p>A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% Cl: 1.22 to 2.19]).</p><p>Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data.</p><p>Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.</p><p>Consequently, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.</p><h3>Fractures</h3><p class="First">In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care.</p><h3>Macular Edema</h3><p class="First">Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.</p><p>Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione.</p><p>Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Vitamin B12 Levels</h3><p class="First">In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks' duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B <span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B <span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride or any other oral antidiabetic drug.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  Congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> </li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span> </p><p>Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone from the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years.</p><p>In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add- on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3.0%).</p><p>In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9.0% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Common Adverse Events: 16- to 26-Week Monotherapy Trials</span></span></p><p>A summary of the incidence and type of common adverse events reported in three pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of pioglitazone is provided in Table 1.

Therefore, if an inducer of CYP2C8 is started or stopped during treatment with pioglitazone, changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based on clinical response without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 45 mg for pioglitazone <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently causes a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients.</p><h3>Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance</h3><p class="First">Drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g., cationic drugs such as cimetidine) have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems, and may increase the accumulation of metformin and the risk for lactic acidosis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients.</p><h3>Alcohol</h3><p class="First">Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism.

Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response.</p><h3>Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control</h3><p class="First">Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride tablets, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control.

Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas biguanides act primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><p>In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.</p><p>Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metformin hydrochloride</span></p><p>Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or healthy subjects [except in specific circumstances, <span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin- resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol.
