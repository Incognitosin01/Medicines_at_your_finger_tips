Diflucan is available as a tablet or as an oral suspension (liquid).</p><p>Diflucan is used to treat infections caused by fungus, which can invade any part of the body including the mouth, throat, esophagus, lungs, bladder, genital area, and the blood.</p><p>Diflucan is also used to prevent fungal infection in people who have a weak immune system caused by cancer treatment, bone marrow transplant, or diseases such as AIDS.</p><p>Diflucan is also used to treat a certain type of meningitis in people with HIV or AIDS.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Certain other drugs can cause unwanted or dangerous effects when used with Diflucan,</b>especially cisapride, erythromycin, pimozide, quinidine, astemizole, higher doses of terfenadine, and many other medications that are broken down by certain enzymes that are inhibited by fluconazole.
