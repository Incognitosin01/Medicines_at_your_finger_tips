The bleeding episode may be due to an injury or surgery. Antihemophilic factor recombinant porcine sequence is a manmade protein to replace the AHF produced naturally in the body to help form blood clots to stop bleeding.</p><p>Acquired Hemophilia A, also called classic hemophilia, is a condition that develops where the body does not make enough AHF. If you do not have enough AHF and you become injured, your blood will not form clots properly. You might bleed into and damage your muscles and joints. AHF injection is given to increase the levels of AHF in the blood.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Obizur</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
