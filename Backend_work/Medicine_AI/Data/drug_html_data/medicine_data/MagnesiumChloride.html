Monitor patient and fetal status, and serum magnesium levels closely.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Aluminum: The parenteral product may contain aluminum; toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or renal dysfunction. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of &gt;4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses (Federal Register, 2002). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC, 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors, 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates. See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Electrolyte abnormalities:  Concurrent hypokalemia or hypocalcemia can accompany a magnesium deficit. Hypomagnesemia is associated with hypokalemia and requires correction in order to normalize potassium. </p><p>• Parenteral administration: Monitor serum magnesium level, respiratory rate, blood pressure, deep tendon reflex, and renal function when administered parenterally, particularly with repeated dosing; magnesium toxicity can lead to fatal cardiovascular arrest and/or respiratory paralysis.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>IV: Rapid administration: ECG monitoring, vital signs, deep tendon reflexes; magnesium, calcium, and potassium levels; renal function during administration</p><p>Oral: Renal function; magnesium levels; bowel movements</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
