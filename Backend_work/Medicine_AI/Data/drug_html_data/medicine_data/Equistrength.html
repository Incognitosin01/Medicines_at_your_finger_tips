To minimize the potential source of infection that the mare may pose to the foal, the mare should be treated 1 month prior to anticipated foaling date followed by re-treatment 10 days to 2 weeks after birth of foal.  Horses and ponies over 8 months of age should be routinely dosed every 6 weeks.  It is recommended that severely debilitated animals not be treated with this preparation.</p><p>ADMINISTRATION:   After removing the cap, the paste should be deposited on the dorsum of the tongue.  Introduce the nozzle end of the syringe at the corner of the mouth.  Direct the syringe backwards and depress the plunger to deposit the paste on the tongue.  Given in this manner, it is unlikely that rejection of the paste will occur.  Raising the horse's head sometimes assists in the swallowing process.  When only part of the paste has been used, replace the cap on the syringe nozzle.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EFFICACY:</span>  Critical (worm count) studies in horses demonstrated that pyrantel pamoate administered at the recommended dosage was efficacious against mature infections of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span> (&gt;90%), <span class="Italics">S. edentatus</span> (69%), <span class="Italics">S. equinus</span> (&gt;90%), <span class="Italics">Oxyuris equi</span> (81%), <span class="Italics">Parascaris equorum</span> (&gt;90%), and small strongyles (&gt;90%).<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RESIDUE WARNING:  Not intended for use in horses intended for human consumption.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RECOMMENDED STORAGE:</span>  Store at controlled room temperature 15 degrees - 30 degrees C (59 degrees - 86 degrees F).<br/></p><p class="First">Equistrength</p><p>(pyrantel pamoate)</p><p>PASTE</p><p>Equine Anthelmintic</p><p>FOR ORAL USE ONLY.</p><p>FOR ANIMAL USE ONLY.</p><p>KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.</p><p>ANADA 200-350, Approved by FDA</p><p>APPLE FLAVORED</p><p></p><p class="ddc-disclaimer-link">Medical Disclaimer</p></body></html>
