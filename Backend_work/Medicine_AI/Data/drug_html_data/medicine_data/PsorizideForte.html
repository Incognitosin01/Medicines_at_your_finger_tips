These drug ingredients are listed in the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (HPUS).<span class="Sup">4</span></p><p>Inactive ingredients: Lactose and Magnesium Stearate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacological Class:</span> Homeopathic drug.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosage form:</span> Oral 600 mg scored tablet. May be swallowed whole, chewed or dissolved in the mouth and swallowed.</p><h2>Psorizide Forte - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The active ingredients in <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> are simple biochemical compounds. The exact mechanism of action is unknown; however, it is believed <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> addresses a primary genetic biochemical defect.<span class="Sup">5</span></p><p><span class="Bold">FUMARIC ACID</span> is a naturally occurring four carbon organic acid important in the Krebs cycle. This biochemical pathway is of central importance to energy production. Each tablet contains approximately 30 mg fumaric acid (calculated). Fumaric Acid has many uses, including use as a food additive (GRAS) and as a chelating agent.<span class="Sup">13</span> The use of fumaric acid and its derivatives (esters) as a treatment for psoriasis is increasing worldwide.<span class="Sup">14-20</span> Very little is known about its clinical pharmacology; however, dose dependant inhibitory effects on keratinocyte proliferation have been demonstrated. <span class="Sup">16,21</span></p><p><span class="Bold">POTASSIUM BROMIDE</span> dissolves and dissociates in the digestive tract into its ionic constituents. Each tablet contains approximately 15 mg bromide (calculated). Ionic bromide is rapidly and completely absorbed from the intestine and distributed almost exclusively into the extracellular fluids.<span class="Sup">11,12</span> Bromide is eliminated by the kidneys and the elimination half-life is 11-12 days. "Once a day" dosing will lead to a steady state concentration in about seven weeks.<span class="Sup">11</span></p><p><span class="Bold">NICKEL SULPHATE</span> dissolves and dissociates in the digestive tract into its ionic constituents. Each tablet contains approximately 1.0 mg of ionic nickel (calculated). According to studies, 15% to 50% of ionic nickel is absorbed on a fasted stomach.<span class="Sup">6</span> Food markedly decreases the rate and extent of nickel absorption.<span class="Sup">7,8</span> Clinical studies show that serum concentrations of nickel are variable among patients after administering the same dose.<span class="Sup">9</span> Peak serum nickel concentration is reached about two hours after oral administration. "Once a day" dosing leads to steady state serum concentrations in approximately one week. Nickel is in its highly stable divalent cation state and is therefore not expected to be metabolized to any significant degree in the body. Absorbed nickel is primarily excreted in the urine and elimination half-life is about 21 hours.<span class="Sup">7,9</span> Renal clearance is rapid and efficient, and nickel does not accumulate in the body.<span class="Sup">10</span></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">A variety of controlled clinical studies have been performed using various sources of both nickel and bromide in over 300 subjects. Clinical efficacy and safety have been documented in a significant number of subjects. Published and unpublished reports are available upon request.<span class="Sup">22,23,32</span></p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> is indicated for the treatment of contact dermatitis due to nickel (metal/jewelry allergy,) dyshidrotic hand/foot eczema, and mild to severe psoriasis. It has been found to work well with a variety of combination therapies. Eczema, seborrhea and a variety of chronic pruritic inflammatory dermatoses generally respond well also.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Although there are no known contraindications, patients who are allergic to any <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> ingredient should consult a physician prior to taking the medication. (Refer to Section on Hypersensitivity)</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Do not use if imprinted seal under bottle cap is missing or broken. Do not use if pregnant or nursing. If allergic to nickel or metal objects such as jewelry, see PRECAUTIONS for hypersensitivity information. Lactose intolerant patients may have gastrointestinal difficulty. This has very rarely been reported at the doses used.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Carefully adjust dosage to weight when treating young children. Use cautiously in setting of kidney disease. (see Dosage and Administration) If skin rash appears or if nervous symptoms persist, recur frequently, or are unusual, discontinue use.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Caution should be used when administering to patients with a history of contact sensitivity to nickel (common metal exposure). Nickel allergy may be confirmed by a positive nickel patch test. Most patients with positive nickel allergy history or a positive nickel patch test <span class="Bold">do not</span> have any untoward reaction to administration of <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte.</span> However, if there is a history of nickel sensitivity, begin with a very low dose and slowly increase over a period of six weeks as tolerated. Progressive G.I. absorption allows desensitization to occur.<span class="Sup">8</span></p><p>If new pruritic rashes occur or persist, discontinue <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> and treat appropriately. <span class="Bold">Do not use if there is a history of extra-cutaneous hypersensitivity to nickel or any ingredient in <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte.</span></span></p><h3>Information for patients</h3><p class="First">Patients using <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> should receive the following information and instructions:</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">There are no known drug interactions.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility</h3><p class="First">No studies have been done on the carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility of <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte.</span> No carcinogenesis or mutagenesis has been reported in multiple animal studies for oral administration of fumaric acid and soluble nickel and bromide salts (active ingredients) even at very high doses.<span class="Sup">24-27</span></p><h3>Effects of fumaric acid</h3><p class="First">It is not listed as a carcinogen by ACGIH, IARC, NIOSH, NTP, or OSHA.<span class="Sup">26</span> It is a GRAS substance (generally recognized as safe) and is commonly used in food processing.</p><h3>Effects of soluble potassium bromide</h3><p class="First">KBr is not listed as a carcinogen by the NTP, IARC, and OSHA.<span class="Sup">28</span></p><h3>Effects of soluble nickel sulphate</h3><p class="First">Studies on experimental animals have never indicated that nickel, at any dose, is a carcinogen when introduced to the body orally. Furthermore, Nickel sulphate and other highly water soluble nickel salts, have never been known to induce carcinogenesis via any route of introduction including: oral, inhalation, cutaneous, IM, or IP.<span class="Sup">10-12,27</span> No adverse effects were noted on fertility or reproduction in a 3-generational study of albino Wistar rats fed up to 1000 ppm Ni per day, which is equivalent to 50 mg/kg body weight per day Ni.<span class="Sup">27</span></p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte. PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> should not be given to a pregnant woman.</p><h3>Nursing mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. However, since many drugs are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric use</h3><p class="First">Carefully adjust dosage to weight when treating young children.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> contains low doses of active ingredients. Therefore there are minimal known side effects.</p><p>(see PRECAUTIONS for hypersensitivity information)</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Fumaric acid toxicity</h3><p class="First">The oral rat LD<span class="Sub">50</span> is 9300mg/kg.<span class="Sup">26</span> This is 3800 times the maximum dose recommended for <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte.</span></p><h3>Potassium bromide toxicity</h3><p class="First">Indications of toxicity due to oral overdosage of bromide may include nausea and vomiting, apathy, disturbed coordination, loss of memory, drowsiness, loss of emotional control, agitation, hallucination, tremors, depressed reflexes, stupor, and coma. Acute toxic reactions in humans have been reported at doses as low as 1000mg.<span class="Sup">31</span> This level is 67 times the dose received in one tablet of <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte.</span></p><h3>Nickel sulphate toxicity</h3><p class="First">The oral rat LD<span class="Sub">50</span> for nickel sulphate hexahydrate is 275mg/kg.<span class="Sup">29</span> Symptoms of toxicity due to oral overdosage of nickel sulphate may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, giddiness, lassitude, headaches, cough, and shortness of breath.<span class="Sup">30</span> The lowest observed transitory toxic effects from human ingestion of soluble nickel salts is approximately 8 mg nickel/kg body weight.<span class="Sup">30</span> This is 138 times the maximum dose recommended for <span class="Italics">PSORIZIDE<span class="Sup">®</span> Forte</span> (see below).</p><h2>Psorizide Forte Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Absorption of nickel sulphate is variable among individuals<span class="Bold">. For maximum absorption, tablets should be taken orally at the beginning of the day</span> (or any convenient time after having taken nothing but water for at least 7 hours). Take nothing but water for one hour after taking medication to aid absorption.</p><h3>In the setting of renal impairment</h3><p class="First">Dosage should be adjusted and serum nickel and bromide levels should be followed. Steady state trough level should be drawn <span class="Bold">prior</span> to ingesting the day's dose after one week of dosing or at appropriate intervals. Target trough serum nickel level is 30-60 mcg/L. (Caution: post dose peak levels are unreliable.)</p><h3>Maintenance phase</h3><p class="First">In order to maintain symptomatic relief, medication may be continued at the same or reduced initial phase dose level. Treatment duration depends on the individual. <span class="Bold">For allergic nickel dermatitis, continue 2 tablets 1 hour prior to breakfast for weeks 7 – 16. (Refer to Hypersensitivity section above). Some patients may require continued or intermittent repeated treatment to maintain nickel desensitization.</span></p><h2>INACTIVE INGREDIENTS</h2><p class="First">Lactose and magnesium stearate.</p><h2>How is Psorizide Forte Supplied</h2><p class="First">Scored tablets, off white in color with green speckles, with <span class="Bold">imprinted on one side and a score on the other</span>, in child-resistant and tamperresistant bottles of 90<span class="Bold">.
