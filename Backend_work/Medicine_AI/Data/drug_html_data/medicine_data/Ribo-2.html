They are needed in small amounts only and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Riboflavin (vitamin B 2) is needed to help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It also makes it possible for oxygen to be used by your body.</p><p>Lack of riboflavin may lead to itching and burning eyes, sensitivity of eyes to light, sore tongue, itching and peeling skin on the nose and scrotum, and sores in the mouth. Your doctor may treat this condition by prescribing riboflavin for you.</p><p>Some conditions may increase your need for riboflavin. These include:</p><ul>
<li>Alcoholism</li>
<li>Burns</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Diarrhea (continuing)</li>
<li>Fever (continuing)</li>
<li>Illness (continuing)</li>
<li>Infection</li>
<li>Intestinal diseases</li>
<li>Liver disease</li>
<li>Overactive thyroid</li>
<li>Serious injury</li>
<li>Stress (continuing)</li>
<li>Surgical removal of stomach</li>
</ul><p>In addition, riboflavin may be given to infants with high blood levels of bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia).</p><p>Increased need for riboflavin should be determined by your health care professional.</p><p>Claims that riboflavin is effective for treatment of acne, some kinds of anemia (weak blood), migraine headaches, and muscle cramps have not been proven.</p><p>Oral forms of riboflavin are available without a prescription.</p><h2>Importance of Diet</h2><p>For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.</p><p>Riboflavin is found in various foods, including milk and dairy products, fish, meats, green leafy vegetables, and whole grain and enriched cereals and bread. It is best to eat fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible since they contain the most vitamins. Food processing may destroy some of the vitamins, although little riboflavin is lost from foods during ordinary cooking.</p><p>Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body also needs other substances found in food such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves often cannot work without the presence of other foods.</p><p>The daily amount of riboflavin needed is defined in several different ways.</p><ul>For U.S.—
<li>Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).</li>
<li>Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).</li>
</ul><ul>For Canada—
<li>Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.</li>
</ul><p>Normal daily recommended intakes for riboflavin are generally defined as follows:</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Ribo-2</h2><p>If you are taking this dietary supplement without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label.
