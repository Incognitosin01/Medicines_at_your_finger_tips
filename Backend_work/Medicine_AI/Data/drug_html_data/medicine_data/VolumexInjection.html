</ul><p class="First">R<span class="Sub">x</span> Only</p><p>The Volumex brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>Volumex Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Volumex (Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection) is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical containing iodinated I 131 albumin for intravenous use. Each mL of sterile, nonpyrogenic, aqueous, colorless to very pale yellow solution provides approximately 10 mg protein (albumin human), 16 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.6 mg monobasic sodium phosphate, not more, than 0.4 mg guanidine hydrochloride, sodium chloride for isotonicity, and 9 mg benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The stabilizer acetyltryptophanate and sodium caprylate have a concentration of less than 0.0089M. The pH has been adjusted to 7.2-7.8 with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.</p><p>Volumex was prepared from blood that was nonreactive when tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HB<span class="Sub">s</span>Ag). The structure of the complex is unknown.</p><h2>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2><p class="First">Iodine 131 decays by beta and gamma emissions with a physical half-life of 8.08 days.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>Photons that are useful for detection and imaging studies are listed in Table 1.</p><p></p><p><span class="Bold">EXTERNAL RADIATION</span></p><p>The specific gamma ray constant for iodine 131 is 2.2R/hour-millicurie at 1 cm. The first half-value layer is 0.24 cm lead (Pb). A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that result from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2. To facilitate control of the radiation exposure from this radionuclide, the use of a 2.55 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1,000.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Volumex Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Following intravenous injection, radioiodinated albumin human is uniformly distributed throughout the intravascular pool within 10 minutes; extravascular distribution takes place more slowly. Iodinated I 131 albumin also can be detected in the lymph and in certain body tissues within 10 minutes after injection, but maximum distribution of radioactivity throughout the extravascular space does not occur until two to four days after administration. The time at which extravascular activity is maximal has been designated as the “equilibrium time.” When this point has been reached, the radioactivity remaining in the intravascular and extravascular spaces decreases slowly and exponentially in parallel fashion.</p><p>The administered radioactivity is eliminated almost entirely in the urine, only about 2 percent of the total dose ultimately appearing in the feces.</p><p>The biologic half-life of iodinated I 131 albumin is dependent upon a number of factors, and published studies have varied considerably in their reporting of this figure. It has ranged, in the literature, from below 10 days to over 20 days. One important factor affecting the biologic half-life is the initial rate of excretion, and this depends in part on the quality of the iodinated I 131 albumin. With Volumex, the biologic half-life in normal individuals has been reported to be approximately 14 days.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Volumex Injection</h2><p class="First">Volumex (Iodinated I 131 Allbumin injection) is indicated for use in determinations of total blood and plasma volumes and in protein turnover studies</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">A few instances of hyperpyrexia and aseptic (chemical) meningeal irritation have been reported</p><p>with the use of iodinated I 131 albumin in cisternography. Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection is not approved for use in cisternography.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>In the use of any radioactive material, care should be taken to insure minimum radiation exposure to the patient and occupational workers consistent with proper patient management.</p><p>Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or whether iodinated I 131 albumin affects fertility in males or females.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection. It is also not known whether this agent can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.</p><p>Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection should be administered to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p>Ideally, examinations using radiopharmaceuticals, especially those elective in nature, of a woman of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few (approximately 10) days following the onset of menses.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>Since iodine 131 is excreted in human milk during lactation, formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric use</span></p><p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Although the immunological properties of albumin human are believed to be virtually unaltered by the iodination process, there is a theoretical possibility that allergic reactions may occur in patients receiving additional doses a number of weeks after an initial dose.</p><h2>Volumex Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Volumex (Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection) is administered intravenously.</span></p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and abnormal coloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.<br/></p><p>Volumex (Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection) may be colorless to very pale yellow. Solutions with excessive coloration should not be used.</p><p>When a procedure such as a blood volume or a circulation time determination is to be repeated, the total dosage administered in any one week should not exceed 200 microcuries.</p><p>To minimize the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid, prior administration of Lugol’s Solution (Strong Iodine Solution USP) may be used. Ten drops of Lugol’s Solution three times daily, beginning at least 24 hours before administration of Volumex and continuing for one or two weeks thereafter, is a suitable dose. Complete assay data for each single unit dose are provided on the container.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> The expiration date given on the container pertains to the biologic properties of the material and not to the radioactivity level. It is important to make certain that the radioactivity in the dose at the time of administration is sufficient for the intended use.</p><p>The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note:</span> A shielded syringe may be used for withdrawing and injecting the iodinated I 131 albumin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Total Blood and Plasma Volumes</span></p><p>Dosage may range from 5 to 50 microcuries.</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood Volume Determination</span></p><p><span class="Bold">A. Reference Solution</span></p><p>Reference solution is provided with each single unit dose of Volumex. Determine the radioactivity concentration (net cpm/mL) of the reference solution. Care must be taken to assure that the reference solution and the blood samples (Step B3) are assayed using the same geometric configuration.</p><p><br/>

<span class="Bold">C. Calculation of Blood Volume</span></p><p>1. Take a known aliquot from each blood sample and determine radioconcentration in net cpm/mL.</p><p>2. Plot the 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 minute sample counts (net cpm/mL) on semilog graph paper using the average count value of each sample and determine the radioconcentration at injection time (zero time) by drawing a straight line through the 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 minute points to zero time. The x ordinate of the</p><p>    graph is the sample withdrawal time and the logarithmic y ordinate is</p><p>    radioconcentration in net cpm/mL.</p><p>3. Calculate patient’s blood volume (in mL) using the following formula:</p><p><span class="Bold">Net cpm/mL reference solution</span>                                  blood<br/>

It must be remembered that it is always necessary to correct for background radioactivity remaining in the blood from former determinations. Therefore, for each determination after the first one, a background blood sample must be taken just <span class="Bold">before</span> the iodinated I 131 albumin is injected.</p><p><span class="Bold">Background Blood Sample</span></p><p><span class="Bold">      Net cpm/mL reference solution blood             </span>      x     DF     =    blood</p><p> Net cpm/mL                           Net cpm/mL                                      volume</p><p>postinjection        minus          background                                     (in mL)</p><p>blood sample                          blood sample</p><p><span class="Bold">Plasma Volume Determination</span></p><p>The procedure is essentially the same as that for blood volume determination, except that the blood sample drawn from the patient is centrifuged, the red blood cells are removed, and net cpm/mL of the plasma is determined.
