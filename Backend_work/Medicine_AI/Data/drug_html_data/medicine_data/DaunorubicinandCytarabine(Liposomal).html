Daunomycin intercalates at points of local uncoiling of the double helix. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it appears that direct binding to DNA (intercalation) and inhibition of DNA repair (topoisomerase II inhibition) result in blockade of DNA and RNA synthesis and fragmentation of DNA. Cytarabine (conventional) is a pyrimidine analog and is incorporated into DNA; however, the primary action is inhibition of DNA polymerase resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and repair. The degree of cytotoxicity correlates linearly with incorporation into DNA; therefore, incorporation into the DNA is responsible for drug activity and toxicity. Cytarabine is specific for the S phase of the cell cycle (blocks progression from the G1 to the S phase).</p><p>Per animal data, liposomes are taken up intact by bone marrow cells (to a greater degree in leukemia cells versus normal bone marrow cells) and are degraded following cellular internalization, thus releasing cytarabine and daunorubicin within the cells.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Daunorubicin: 6.6 L; Cytarabine: 7.1 L</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Upon release from the liposomes, daunorubicin is catalyzed by aldoketo reductase and carbonyl reductase to daunorubicinol (active metabolite); cytarabine is metabolized by cytidine deaminase to Ara-U (inactive metabolite).</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (9% daunorubicin; 71% cytarabine and Ara-U)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>31.5 hours (daunorubicin); 40.4 hours (cytarabine) with &gt;99% of drug(s) remaining encapsulated in the liposomes</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Acute myeloid leukemia:</b> Treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Serious hypersensitivity to daunorubicin, cytarabine, or any component of the formulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Calculate dose based on the daunorubicin component. Prior to each dose, calculate the cumulative anthracycline exposure. Assess cardiac function, liver, and renal function prior to therapy initiation; also evaluate complete blood counts in addition to cardiac function and liver/renal function prior to each consolidation cycle. Therapy consists of 1 to 2 induction cycles followed by up to 2 consolidation cycles.

Permanently discontinue daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal).</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Allow vials to come to room temperature for 30 minutes prior to reconstitution. Reconstitute each vial with 19 mL sterile water for injection (using a sterile syringe) to a concentration of 2.2 mg/mL; swirl the vial contents for 5 minutes (using a timer) while gently inverting the vial every 30 seconds. Do not heat, vortex, or shake the vials vigorously. Allow reconstituted vials to rest for 15 minutes (product should be opaque, purple, with homogenous dispersion and essentially free of visible particulates). Gently invert each vial 5 times prior to withdrawing dose for further dilution. Transfer appropriate dose volume (dose is calculated based on the daunorubicin component) to an infusion bag containing 500 mL of NS or D5W (discard unused residual solution in the vial). Mix bag by gentle inversion; the final solution will be deep purple, translucent, with homogeneous dispersion and free from visible particulates.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Daunorubicin/cytarabine (liposomal) is associated with a moderate emetic potential; administer antiemetics prior to treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting.</p><p>IV: For IV administration only; do not administer IM or SubQ. Administer over 90 minutes (for induction and consolidation cycles) via an infusion pump through a central venous or peripherally inserted central catheter. May use an in-line membrane filter with a pore diameter ≥15 micron. Flush the line with NS or D5W after infusion. Do not mix with or administer with any other medications.

Verify drug name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid dosing errors.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bone marrow suppression: Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in all patients in a clinical study comparing daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal) to conventional 7 + 3 therapy; prolonged thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were also observed more frequently with the daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal) arm. Neutropenic fever has also been reported. Monitor blood counts frequently. Do not initiate a new cycle until ANC recovers to &gt;500/mm<sup>3</sup> and platelets recover to &gt;50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>• Cardiotoxicity: Cardiotoxicity may occur due to the anthracycline component (daunorubicin) of the formulation. Risk factors for cardiotoxicity include prior exposure to anthracyclines, preexisting cardiac disease, previous mediastinal radiotherapy, or concomitant use of cardiotoxic medications. Other risk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity include age 60 and older at time of treatment and 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obesity) during or after treatment (Armenian 2017). Prior to therapy initiation, obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG), a multi-gated radionuclide angiography (MUGA) scan, or echocardiogram (ECHO) to assess cardiac function. Repeat cardiac assessment via MUGA or ECHO prior to consolidation therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal) and as clinically necessary. Therapy is not recommended in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than normal; discontinue in patients with abnormal cardiac function unless benefit of treatment outweighs the risks. A total cumulative dose of daunorubicin (conventional) 550 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in patients with prior mediastinal radiation) has been associated with an increased incidence of heart failure; calculate the total lifetime cumulative anthracycline dose prior to each cycle of daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal). Treatment is not recommended in patients whose exposure has reached the maximum cumulative threshold.</p><p>• Copper exposure: Reconstituted daunorubicin/cytarabine (liposomal) contains copper gluconate (14% elemental copper). The maximum (theoretical) total copper exposure during daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal) therapy is 106 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. There is no clinical experience with use of this medication in patients with Wilson disease or other copper-related metabolic disorders; monitor total serum copper, serum non-ceruloplasmin bound copper, 24-hour urine copper levels and serial neuropsychological exams in these patient populations (use daunorubicin and cytarabine [liposomal] only if the benefits outweigh the risks). May require consultation with a hepatologist and nephrologist for management of acute copper toxicity; discontinue therapy if acute copper toxicity occurs.</p><p>• Extravasation: Daunorubicin (conventional) is a potent vesicant; extravasation of conventional daunorubicin has been associated with severe local tissue necrosis. The daunorubicin (liposomal) component of the formulation may be an irritant (injection site reactions have been reported). Daunorubicin/cytarabine (liposomal) is for IV administration only; do not administer IM or SubQ. Ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation.</p><p>• Gastrointestinal toxicity: Daunorubicin/cytarabine (liposomal) is associated with a moderate emetic potential; administer antiemetics prior to treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea/colitis, constipation, and decreased appetite have been reported with daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal).</p><p>• Hemorrhage: Serious hemorrhage events (associated with prolonged severe thrombocytopenia), including grade 3 and higher events, have occurred; fatal CNS hemorrhages have also been reported. In a clinical study, epistaxis was the most frequently reported hemorrhagic event. Monitor blood counts frequently; may require platelet transfusion support.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious or fatal hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reactions) have been reported with daunorubicin and cytarabine; monitor closely. The infusion rate of daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal) may be interrupted or slowed for mild or moderate hypersensitivity reactions; manage symptoms as appropriate. If a severe or life-threatening reaction occurs, discontinue daunorubicin and cytarabine (liposomal) permanently and manage symptoms as clinically necessary. Premedication with antihistamines and or corticosteroids may be required.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p><b><i>• </i></b>Elderly: Bleeding events occurred more frequently in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients.</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p><i><b>• </b></i>Formulations:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Daunorubicin/cytarabine (liposomal) has different dosage recommendations than daunorubicin (conventional), cytarabine (conventional), daunorubicin (liposomal), and cytarabine (liposomal).
