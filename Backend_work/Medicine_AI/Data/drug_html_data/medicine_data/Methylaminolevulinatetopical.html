A healthcare provider will apply  methyl aminolevulinate in a clinical setting.</p><p>Before this medicine is applied, your skin lesions will be gently scraped to remove any scales or crusting. After methyl aminolevulinate is applied, your caregiver will cover the treatment area with a bandage. You will need to leave this bandage in place for 3 hours.</p><p>During this 3-hour period, avoid exposure to cold temperatures and sunlight or bright indoor lights. Wear a wide-brimmed hat if you must be outdoors during this time.</p><p>After your bandaging is removed, any excess medication will be removed with a saline solution. You will then be ready to receive the light treatment.</p><p>You will be given eye-wear to protect your eyes during red light treatment.</p><p>You may feel a slight stinging or burning during light therapy. Tell your caregivers if you have any type of severe discomfort.</p><p>Methyl aminolevulinate and red light therapy is usually given in two sessions one week apart. Your treatment schedule may be different. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>It may take several weeks before you notice improvement in your skin condition. Your doctor will need to check your treated skin 3 months after the end of your last treatment with methyl aminolevulinate.</p><p><b>Your skin lesions may need to be treated more than once, and they may come back after treatment.</b> Talk to your doctor about the number of treatments needed to treat your condition.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because methyl aminolevulinate is applied only when needed prior to red light therapy, you will not be on a dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  methyl aminolevulinate is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using methyl aminolevulinate?</h2><p>Tell your caregivers right away if any of this medicine gets into your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p><p>Avoid touching the treated skin areas after methyl aminolevulinate cream has been applied to them. Special gloves must be worn by the healthcare provider while applying this medication, and you should not allow your own fingers to come into contact with the cream on your skin.</p><p>For at least 48 hours after your treatment, avoid exposing treated skin to sunlight, sunlamps, tanning beds, or other bright lights. <b>Sunscreen is not effective enough to protect treated skin from harm caused by bright light during this time</b>. Wear protective clothing whenever you are outdoors.</p><p>Even if you do not receive the light therapy portion of your treatment, you must still protect your skin from light for 48 hours after the cream was applied.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Methyl aminolevulinate side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
