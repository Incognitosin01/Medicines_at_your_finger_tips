It is also used to treat HR positive breast cancer that has progressed or worsened after hormonal therapy.</p><p>Fulvestrant injection is also used together with ribociclib to treat HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women who have not been previously treated with other medicines or whose cancer has progressed or worsened after hormonal therapy.</p><p>Fulvestrant injection is also used in combination with palbociclib or abemaciclib to treat HR positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic (cancer that has spread) breast cancer in women who have received hormonal therapy.</p><p>Many of the breast cancer tumors will grow when estrogen is available in the body. Fulvestrant blocks the effects of estrogen in the body. As a result, the amount of estrogen that the tumor is exposed to, is reduced, which will limit the growth of the tumor.</p><p>Fulvestrant is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using fulvestrant</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fulvestrant, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fulvestrant or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fulvestrant injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fulvestrant injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving fulvestrant, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using fulvestrant with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of fulvestrant. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of fulvestrant</h2><p>Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many side effects. Before receiving fulvestrant, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you fulvestrant in a medical facility. It is given as a shot into the buttocks slowly on days 1, 15, 29, and once every month thereafter.</p><p>Fulvestrant comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Your doctor may also give you other medicines (eg, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist) while being treated with fulvestrant and palbociclib, abemaciclib, or ribociclib, before your menopause.</p><p>Cancer medicines can cause nausea or vomiting, even after receiving medicines to prevent it. If you have nausea and vomiting after receiving fulvestrant, talk to your doctor or nurse about ways to control these effects.</p><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>Fulvestrant needs to be given on a fixed schedule. If you miss a dose, call your doctor, home health caregiver, or treatment clinic for instructions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using fulvestrant</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that fulvestrant is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving fulvestrant while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can bear children, your doctor may give you a pregnancy test 7 days before you start receiving fulvestrant to make sure you are not pregnant. Use a highly effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment and for 1 year after your last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Talk with your doctor before receiving fulvestrant if you plan to have children. Some men and women who receive fulvestrant have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><p>Fulvestrant may increase your risk of bleeding. This is more likely to occur if you have bleeding problems or if you are taking a blood thinner (eg, warfarin). Tell your doctor right away if you have unusual bleeding or bruising after receiving fulvestrant.</p><p>Fulvestrant may cause you to have bleeding from the vagina, especially when you first start receiving it. If the bleeding continues or is bothersome, check with your doctor right away.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs after receiving fulvestrant.</p><p>Before you have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are using fulvestrant.
