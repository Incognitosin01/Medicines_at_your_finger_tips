</ul><p><span class="Bold">[<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</span></p><h2>2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>2.1. General Dosing Instructions</h3><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">5</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>After observing the response to initial therapy with Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs.</p><h3>2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets in adults is two Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 375 mg tablets (750 mg) once daily, one Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 750 mg (750 mg) once daily, or two Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 500 mg tablets (1,000 mg) once daily. Patients already taking naproxen 250 mg, 375 mg, or 500 mg twice daily (morning and evening) may have their total daily dose replaced with Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets as a single daily dose.</p><p>During long-term administration, the dose of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. In patients who tolerate lower doses of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets well, the dose may be increased to two Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 750 mg tablets (1,500 mg), or three Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 500 mg tablets (1,500 mg) once daily for limited periods when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating patients, especially at the higher dose levels, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefit to offset the potential increased risk [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]. The lowest effective dose should be sought and used in every patient. Symptomatic improvement in arthritis usually begins within one week; however, treatment for two weeks may be required to achieve a therapeutic benefit.</p><h3>2.3 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendinitis and Bursitis</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose is two Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 500 mg tablets (1,000 mg) once daily. For patients requiring greater analgesic benefit, two Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 750 mg tablets (1,500 mg) or three Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 500 mg tablets (1,500 mg) may be used for a limited period. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed two Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 500 mg tablets (1,000 mg).</p><h3>2.4 Acute Gout</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose on the first day is two to three Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 500 mg tablets (1,000 to 1,500 mg) once daily, followed by two Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release 500 mg tablets (1,000 mg) once daily, until the attack has subsided.</p><h3>2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">A lower dose should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or in elderly patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]. Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.</p><h2>3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets are available as follows:</p><p>375 mg: white, capsule-shaped tablet with “N” on one side and “375” on the reverse. Each tablet contains 412.5 mg naproxen sodium equivalent to 375 mg naproxen.</p><h2>4 CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets are contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to naproxen or any components of the drug product <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.7</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.9</span><span class="Italics">)]</span><br/></li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.7</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.8</span><span class="Italics">)]</span><br/></li>
<li><span class="Italics">In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease.  However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Warnings</span> <span class="Italics">and Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Status</span> <span class="Bold">Post</span> <span class="Bold">Coronary</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Artery</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Bypass</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Graft</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">(CABG)</span> <span class="Bold">Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-MI</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk</span> <span class="Bold">Factors</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">for</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">GI</span> <span class="Bold">Bleeding,</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Ulceration,</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">and</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies</span> <span class="Bold">to</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Minimize</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">the</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">GI</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Risks in</span> <span class="Bold">NSAID-treated</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">patients:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.<br/></li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.<br/></li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.<br/></li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.<br/></li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.<br/></li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>5.3 Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including naproxen.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><h3>5.4 Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets, can lead to new onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug</span> <span class="Italics">Interactions</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>5.5 Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs.  Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Interactions</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Avoid the use of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. </p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly.  Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets [<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Drug</span> <span class="Italics">Interactions</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].<span class="Italics"> </span>Avoid the use of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets are mused in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">and</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Warnings</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Precautions</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">5.8</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]. When Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>5.9 Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including naproxen can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p><p>Naproxen sodium is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>5.10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Naproxen may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Use</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">in</span> <span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>5.11 Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Interactions</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h3>5.12 Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>5.13 Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Warnings</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Precautions</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">,</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><h2>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>As with all drugs in this class, the frequency and severity of adverse events depends on several factors: the dose of the drug and duration of treatment; the age, the sex, physical condition of the patient; any concurrent medical diagnoses or individual risk factors. The following adverse reactions are divided into three parts based on frequency and whether or not the possibility exists of a causal relationship between drug usage and these adverse events. In those reactions listed as “Probable Causal Relationship” there is at least one case for each adverse reaction where there is evidence to suggest that there is a causal relationship between drug usage and the reported event.

In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4% for major malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies in rats, rabbit, and mice no evidence of teratogenicity or fetal harm when naproxen was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses 0.13, 0.26, and 0.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1,500 mg/day, respectively.  Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization.

The chemical name is 2-naphthaleneacetic acid, 6-methoxy-α-methyl-sodium salt, (S)-. The molecular weight is 252.24.  Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>NaO<span class="Sub">3</span>, and it has the following chemical structure.</p><p></p><p>Naproxen sodium is an odorless crystalline powder, white to creamy in color. It is soluble in methanol and water. Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets contain 412.5 mg of naproxen sodium, equivalent to 375 mg of naproxen, and 37.5 mg sodium. Each Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients: ammoniomethacrylate copolymer Type A, ammoniomethacrylate copolymer Type B, citric acid, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer Type A, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, and talc. The tablet coating contains hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.</p><h2>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Naproxen has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of naproxen sodium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Naproxen sodium is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">in</span> <span class="Italics">vitro</span>. Naproxen sodium concentrations reached during therapy have produced <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models.</p><p>Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because naproxen sodium is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Although naproxen itself is well absorbed, the sodium salt form is more rapidly absorbed, resulting in higher peak plasma levels for a given dose. Approximately 30% of the total naproxen sodium dose in Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets is present in the dosage form as an immediate release component. The remaining naproxen sodium is coated as microparticles to provide sustained release properties. After oral administration, plasma levels of naproxen are detected within 30 minutes of dosing, with peak plasma levels occurring approximately 5 hours after dosing. The observed terminal elimination half-life of naproxen from both immediate release naproxen sodium and Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets is approximately 15 hours. Steady state levels of naproxen are achieved in 3 days and the degree of naproxen accumulation in the blood is consistent with this.</p><p><span class="Bold">Plasma Naproxen Concentrations Mean of 24 Subjects (+/-2SD) (Steady State, Day 5)</span></p><p></p><p>Pharmacokinetic Parameters at Steady State Day 5 (Mean of 24 Subjects)</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span> </p><p>Naproxen itself is rapidly and completely absorbed from the GI tract with an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> bioavailability of 95%. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile, the absorption phase of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets occurs in the first 4-6 hours after administration. This coincides with disintegration of the tablet in the stomach, the transit of the sustained release microparticles through the small intestine and into the proximal large intestine. An <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> imaging study has been performed in healthy volunteers that confirms rapid disintegration of the tablet matrix and dispersion of the microparticles.</p><p>The absorption rate from the sustained release particulate component of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets is slower than that for conventional naproxen sodium tablets. It is this prolongation of drug absorption processes that maintains plasma levels and allows for once daily dosing.</p><p>Food Effects </p><p>No significant food effects were observed when twenty-four subjects were given a single dose of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets 500 mg either after an overnight fast or 30 minutes after a meal. In common with conventional naproxen and naproxen sodium formulations, food causes a slight decrease in the rate of naproxen absorption following Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Naproxen has a volume of distribution of 0.16 L/kg. At therapeutic levels, naproxen is greater than 99% albumin-bound. At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day, there is a less than proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses. However the concentration of unbound naproxen continues to increase proportionally to dose. Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets exhibit similar dose proportional characteristics.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Naproxen is extensively metabolized to 6-0-desmethyl naproxen and both parent and metabolites do not induce metabolizing enzymes.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>The elimination half-life of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets and conventional naproxen is approximately 15 hours. Steady state conditions are attained after 2 to 3 doses of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets. Most of the drug is excreted in the urine, primarily as unchanged naproxen (less than 1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (less than 1%) and their glucuronide or other conjugates (66 to 92%). A small amount (&lt;5%) of the drug is excreted in the feces. The rate of excretion has been found to coincide closely with the rate of clearance from the plasma. In patients with renal failure, metabolites may accumulate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric:</span></p><p>No pediatric studies have been performed with Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets, thus safety of Naproxen Sodium Controlled-Release Tablets in pediatric populations has not been established.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span></p><p>Chronic alcoholic liver disease and probably other diseases with decreased or abnormal plasma proteins (albumin) reduce the total plasma concentration of naproxen, but the plasma concentration of unbound naproxen is increased. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in these patients. It is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Impairment:</span></p><p>Naproxen pharmacokinetics have not been determined in subjects with renal insufficiency. Given that naproxen is metabolized and conjugates are primarily excreted by the kidneys, the potential exists for naproxen metabolites to accumulate in the presence of renal insufficiency. Elimination of naproxen is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment. Naproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30mL/min) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug</span> <span class="Bold">Interaction</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin:</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics"> </span>When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered.

Its use in combination with salicylate is not recommended because there is evidence that aspirin increases the rate of excretion of naproxen and data are inadequate to demonstrate that naproxen and aspirin produce greater improvement over that achieved with aspirin alone.
