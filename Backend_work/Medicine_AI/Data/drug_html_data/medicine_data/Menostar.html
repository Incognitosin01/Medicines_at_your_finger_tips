Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Estradiol may increase your risk of developing a condition that may lead to uterine cancer. Your doctor may prescribe a progestin to help lower this risk. <b>Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away.</b></p><p>Menostar comes with patient instructions for safe and effective use. Follow these directions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>The adhesive side of Menostar should be placed on a clean, dry area of the lower abdomen or the upper quadrant of the buttock.</p><ul>
<li>Menostar should not be applied to or near the breasts.</li>
<li>The sites of application must be rotated, with an interval of at least 1-week allowed between applications to a same site.</li>
<li>The area selected should not be oily, damaged, or irritated. The waistline should be avoided, since tight clothing may rub the transdermal system off.</li>
<li>Application to areas where sitting would dislodge Menostar should also be avoided.</li>
</ul><p><b>Application</b></p><ul>
<li>Menostar should be applied immediately after opening the pouch and removing the protective liner.</li>
<li>Menostar should be pressed firmly in place with the fingers for at least 10 seconds, making sure there is good contact, especially around the edges.</li>
<li>If the system lifts, apply pressure to maintain adhesion.</li>
<li>In the event that a system should fall off reapply it to a different location. If the system cannot be reapplied, a new system should be applied for the remainder of the 7-day dosing interval.</li>
<li>Only one system should be worn at any one time during the 7-day dosing interval.</li>
<li>Swimming, bathing, or using a sauna while using Menostar has not been studied, and these activities may decrease the adhesion of the system and the delivery of estradiol.</li>
</ul><p><b>Removal of the Menostar Transdermal System</b></p><ul>
<li>Removal of the system should be done carefully and slowly to avoid irritation of the skin.</li>
<li>Should any adhesive remain on the skin after removal of the system, allow the area to dry for 15 minutes. Then gently rubbing the area with an oil-based cream or lotion should remove the adhesive residue.</li>
<li>Used patches still contain some active hormones. Each patch should be carefully folded in half so that it sticks to itself before throwing it away.</li>
</ul><p>If you need surgery or medical tests or if you will be on long-term bed rest, you may need to stop using this medicine for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you are using Menostar.</p><p>Your doctor should check your progress on a regular basis (every 3 to 6 months) to determine whether you should continue this treatment. Self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis, and have regular mammograms while using Menostar.</p><p>Store Menostar patches at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep each patch in its pouch until you are ready to use it.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you forget to change your patch, change it as soon as you remember or wait until your next scheduled patch change. <b>Do not</b> apply two patches at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Menostar?</h2><p>Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may interact with estradiol and lead to unwanted side effects.
