Some patients require the combination of medicine, while others benefit from levodopa alone. By improving muscle control, levodopa allows more normal movements of the body.</p><p>Levodopa alone or in combination is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using levodopa</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For levodopa, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to levodopa or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on levodopa have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of levodopa or carbidopa in children with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Elderly people are especially sensitive to the effects of levodopa. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies suggest that this medication may alter milk production or composition. If an alternative to this medication is not prescribed, you should monitor the infant for side effects and adequate milk intake.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

Intake of normal amounts of protein should be spaced equally throughout the day, or taken as directed by your doctor.</p><p>For patients taking levodopa by itself:</p><ul>
<li>Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) has been found to reduce the effects of levodopa when levodopa is taken by itself. This does not happen with the combination of carbidopa and levodopa. If you are taking levodopa by itself, do not take vitamin products containing vitamin B 6 during treatment, unless prescribed by your doctor.</li>
<li>Large amounts of pyridoxine are also contained in some foods such as bananas, egg yolks, lima beans, meats, peanuts, and whole grain cereals. Check with your doctor about how much of these foods you may have in your diet while you are taking levodopa. Also, ask your health care professional for help when selecting vitamin products.</li>
</ul><p>At first, levodopa may be taken with a meal or a snack, so that any effects like stomach upset will be lessened. Later, as your body becomes accustomed to the medicine, it should be taken on an empty stomach so that it works better. Be sure to talk to your doctor about the best time for you to take levodopa.</p><p>Take levodopa only as directed. Do not take more or less of it, and do not take it more often than your doctor ordered.</p><p>For patients taking carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets:</p><ul>
