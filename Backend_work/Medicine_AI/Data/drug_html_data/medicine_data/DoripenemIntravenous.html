It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. Doripenem will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Doripenem is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using doripenem</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For doripenem, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to doripenem or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of doripenem injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of doripenem injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving doripenem injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving doripenem, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using doripenem with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

<li>Probenecid</li>
<li>Valproic Acid</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of doripenem.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of doripenem</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you doripenem. Doripenem is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. The medicine must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for 1 hour.</p><p>To help clear up your infection completely, <i>doripenem must be given for the full time of treatment,</i> even if you begin to feel better after a few days. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of treatment may decrease the usefulness of doripenem. It may also increase the likelihood that the bacteria causing your infection will develop resistance. If this happens, doripenem and other medicines used to treat infections will not work in the future. Also, doripenem works best when there is a constant amount in the blood or urine. To help keep the amount constant, it must be given on a regular schedule.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using doripenem</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check you closely</i> while you are receiving doripenem. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it.</p><p>Doripenem may cause serious types of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have itching, hives, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive doripenem.</p><p>Some patients may develop tremors or seizures while receiving doripenem. If you already have stroke or a history of seizures and you are taking anticonvulsants, you should continue to take them unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you are also using sodium valproate (Depacon®) or valproic acid (Depakene®).</p><p>Doripenem may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. It may occur 2 months or more after you stop using doripenem. Do not take any medicine to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor. Diarrhea medicines may make the diarrhea worse or make it last longer. If you have any questions about this or if mild diarrhea continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Doripenem side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
