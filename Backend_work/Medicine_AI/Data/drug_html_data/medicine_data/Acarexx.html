Effectiveness against eggs and immature stages has not been proven.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p class="First">Acarexx suspension is administered topically in the ear canal at an ivermectin concentration of 0.01%. One dose of 0.5 mL is applied in each ear. Repeat treatment one time if necessary, based upon the ear mite life cycle and the response to treatment.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p class="First">Tear foil pouch at the notch to remove the two plastic ampules. Use one ampule per ear. Shake well before use. Snap off the cap of the ampule and place the tip into the external ear canal. Squeeze the entire contents of one ampule into the ear and massage the base of the ear to distribute the medication. Repeat the procedure in the other ear using the second ampule. In clinical field trials, ears were not cleaned and many animals still had debris in their ears at the end of the study. Cleaning the ears prior to administration of Acarexx suspension is not necessary to provide effectiveness.</p><h2>Human Warnings</h2><p class="First">Not for human use. Keep out of reach of children.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">The safe use of Acarexx suspension in cats used for breeding purposes, during pregnancy, or in lactating queens, has not been evaluated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In approximately 1% of 80 cats and kittens, pain associated with the pinna and vomiting were observed following treatment with Acarexx suspension.<br/></p><p>To report suspected adverse reactions, to obtain a Material Safety Data Sheet or for technical assistance, call 1-866-638-2226.</p><h2>Effectiveness</h2><p class="First">One treatment with Acarexx suspension was 92% effective in treating adult ear mite <span class="Italics">(Otodectes cynotis)</span> infestations after seven days in a dose titration/confirmation study. In a well-controlled clinical field trial, one treatment of Acarexx suspension was 94% effective in clearing cats and kittens of adult ear mite infestations within 7 to 10 days.</p><h2>Safety</h2><p class="First">In two Target Animal Safety studies, Acarexx suspension was proven to be safe in kittens four weeks of age or older. Four-week-old kittens were administered Acarexx suspension at dose rates of 1X, 3X and 5X the recommended dose for three or six consecutive days and no adverse reactions were observed, except one kitten treated at 1X the dose had histologic evidence of minimal, chronic dermal inflammation of the ear. In a well-controlled clinical field trial, Acarexx suspension was used safely in cats and kittens receiving other frequently used veterinary products such as flea control products, vaccines, anthelmintics, antibiotics and steroids.</p><h2>Storage</h2><p class="First">Store below 86°F (30°C).
