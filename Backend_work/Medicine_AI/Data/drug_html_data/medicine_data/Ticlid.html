An unwanted blood clot can occur with certain heart or blood vessel conditions.</p><p>Ticlid is used to prevent blood clots after a recent heart attack or stroke, and in people who have had a stent placed in the arteries that supply blood to the heart.</p><p>Ticlid may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not take Ticlid if you have any active bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or bleeding in the brain (such as from a head injury), or a blood cell disorder such as anemia (lack of red blood cells) or low levels of platelets (cells that help your blood clot).</p><p>Ticlid can lower blood cells that help your body fight infections and help your blood to clot. You may get an infection or bleed more easily. Call your doctor if you have unusual bruising or bleeding, or signs of infection (fever, chills, body aches).</p><p>You will need frequent blood tests to check your blood cell levels.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use  Ticlid if you are allergic to Ticlid, or if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>severe liver disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any active bleeding such as a stomach ulcer or bleeding in the brain (such as from a head injury); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a blood cell disorder such as anemia (lack of red blood cells) or low levels of platelets (cells that help your blood clot).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>high cholesterol or triglycerides;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a stomach ulcer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stomach or intestinal bleeding;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a history of surgery, injury, or medical emergency;</p>

However, <b>aspirin is sometimes given with this medicine, and aspirin can cause bleeding when it is taken during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Aspirin can also cause side effects in a newborn baby.</b> Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment.</p><p>It is not known whether ticlopidine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while using this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take  Ticlid?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Ticlid may be taken with food if it upsets your stomach.</p><p>If you were switched to Ticlid from another medicine to prevent blood clots, you should stop using the other medicine first. Do not take the medicines together unless your doctor has told you to.</p><p>While using Ticlid, you will need frequent blood tests to check your blood cell levels and liver function.</p><p>Because this medicine keeps your blood from coagulating (clotting) to prevent unwanted blood clots, <b>Ticlid can also make it easier for you to bleed, even from a minor injury</b>. Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have bleeding that will not stop.</p><p>If you need surgery or dental work, tell the surgeon or dentist ahead of time that you are using Ticlid. You may need to stop using the medicine for 10 to 14 days before surgery to prevent excessive bleeding.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking  Ticlid?</h2><p>Avoid activities that may increase your risk of bleeding or injury.
