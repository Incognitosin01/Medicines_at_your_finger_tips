</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Tetracyclines are used to treat infections and to help control acne. Demeclocycline, doxycycline, and minocycline also may be used for other problems as determined by your doctor. Tetracyclines will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Tetracyclines are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Tetracyclines may cause permanent discoloration of teeth and slow down the growth of bones. These medicines should not be given to children 8 years of age and younger unless directed by the child's doctor.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of tetracyclines in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Use is not recommended during the last half of pregnancy. If tetracyclines are taken during that time, they may cause the unborn infant's teeth to become discolored and may slow down the growth of the infant's teeth and bones. In addition, liver problems may occur in pregnant women, especially those receiving high doses by injection into a vein.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Use is not recommended since tetracyclines pass into breast milk. They may cause the nursing baby's teeth to become discolored and may slow down the growth of the baby's teeth and bones. They may also increase the sensitivity of nursing babies' skin to sunlight and cause fungus infections of the mouth and vagina. In addition, minocycline may cause dizziness, light-headedness, or unsteadiness in nursing babies.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with a medication in this class or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
<li>Acitretin</li>
<li>Methoxyflurane</li>

</ul><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class.

<li>Diabetes insipidus (water diabetes)—Demeclocycline may make the condition worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease (does not apply to doxycycline or minocycline)—Patients with kidney disease may have an increased chance of side effects.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Liver disease—Patients with liver disease may have an increased chance of side effects if they use doxycycline or minocycline.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p><i>Do not give tetracyclines to infants or children 8 years of age and younger</i> unless directed by your doctor. Tetracyclines may cause permanently discolored teeth and other problems in patients in these age groups.</p><p>Tetracyclines should be taken with a full glass (8 ounces) of water to prevent irritation of the esophagus (tube between the throat and stomach) or stomach. In addition, most tetracyclines (except doxycycline and minocycline) are best taken on an empty stomach (either 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals). However, if this medicine upsets your stomach, your doctor may want you to take it with food.</p><p><i>Do not take milk, milk formulas, or other dairy products within 1 to 2 hours of the time you take tetracyclines (except doxycycline and minocycline) by mouth</i>. They may keep this medicine from working properly.</p><p><i>If this medicine has changed color or tastes or looks different, has become outdated (old), or has been stored incorrectly (too warm or too damp area or place), do not use it</i>. To do so may cause <i>serious side effects</i>. Throw away the medicine. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.</p><p>For patients taking the <i>oral liquid form</i> of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>Use a specially marked measuring spoon or other device to measure each dose accurately. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.</li>
<li>Do not use after the expiration date on the label since the medicine may not work properly after that date. Check with your pharmacist if you have any questions about this.</li>
</ul><p>For patients taking <i>doxycycline</i> or <i>minocycline</i>:</p><ul>
<li>These medicines may be taken with food or milk if they upset your stomach.</li>
<li>Swallow the capsule (with enteric-coated pellets) form of doxycycline whole. Do not break or crush it.</li>
</ul><p>To help clear up your infection completely, <i>keep taking this medicine for the full time of treatment</i>, even if you begin to feel better after a few days. If you stop taking this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return.</p><p>This medicine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood or urine. <i>To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to take the doses at evenly spaced times day and night</i>. For example, if you are to take four doses a day, the doses should be spaced about 6 hours apart. If this interferes with your sleep or other daily activities, or if you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, check with your health care professional.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>For demeclocycline
