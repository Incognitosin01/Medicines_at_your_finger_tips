It works by fighting bacteria in your body.</p><p>Ceftin is used to treat bacterial infections of the ear, nose, throat, lungs, skin, bones, joints, bladder, or kidneys. Cefuroxime is also used to treat gonorrhea, meningitis, sepsis, or early Lyme disease.</p><p>Ceftin injection is sometimes given just before a surgery to prevent infection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Ceftin if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any type of cephalosporin antibiotic (Omnicef, Keflex, and others).</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease, diabetes, a history of intestinal problems, or if you are malnourished.</p><p>Ceftin can make birth control pills less effective, which may result in pregnancy. Tell your doctor if you are taking birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. You may need to use another form of birth control during treatment with this medicine.</p><p>Take this medication for the entire length of time prescribed by your doctor. Your symptoms may get better before the infection is completely treated. Cefuroxime will not treat a viral infection such as the common cold or flu.</p><p>Antibiotic medicines can cause diarrhea, which may be a sign of a new infection. If you have diarrhea that is watery or has blood in it, call your doctor.
