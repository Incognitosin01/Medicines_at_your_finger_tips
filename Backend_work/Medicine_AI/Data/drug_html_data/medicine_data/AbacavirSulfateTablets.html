</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING: HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS</span><span class="Bold">Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, with multiple organ involvement, have occured with abacavir tablets.<br/>
Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at higher risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; although, hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</span><br/>
Abacavir tablets are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</span> All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir tablets or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir tablets, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment. Discontinue abacavir tablets immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status and even when other diagnoses are possible <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</span><br/>
Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart abacavir tablet or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms, including death can occur within hours. Similar severe reactions have also occurred rarely following the reintroduction of abacavir-containing products in patients who have no history of abacavir hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Abacavir Sulfate Tablets</h2><p class="First">Abacavir tablets, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, are indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.</p><h2>Abacavir Sulfate Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Screening for HLA-B*5701 Allele Prior to Starting Abacavir</h3><p class="First">Screen for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</span></p><h3>Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of abacavir tablets for adults is 600 mg daily, administered orally as either 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of abacavir tablets in HIV-1-infected pediatric patients aged 3 months and older is 8 mg per kg orally twice daily or 16 mg per kg orally once-daily (up to a maximum of 600 mg daily) in combination with other antiretroviral agents.<br/>
Abacavir tablet is also available as a scored tablet for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 14 kg for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate. Before prescribing abacavir tablets, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow abacavir tablets, the oral solution formulation should be prescribed. The recommended oral dosage of abacavir tablets for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients is presented in Table 1.<br/>
Table 1. Dosing Recommendations for Abacavir Scored Tablets in Pediatric Patients</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> Data regarding the efficacy of once-daily dosing is limited to subjects who transitioned from twice-daily dosing to once-daily dosing after 36 weeks of treatment <span class="Italics">[see clinical studies (14.2)]</span></p><h3>Recommended Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of abacavir tablet in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) is 200 mg twice daily. To enable dose reduction, abacavir oral solution (10 mL twice daily) should be used for the treatment of these patients. The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir tablet is contraindicated in these patients.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Abacavir tablets, USP containing abacavir sulfate, USP equivalent to 300 mg abacavir, are yellow colored, biconvex, capsule shaped, film coated tablets debossed with 'H' on one side and '139' on other side separating 13 &amp; 9 with score line.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Abacavir tablet is contraindicated in patients:<br/>
• who have the HLA-B*5701 allele <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</span><br/>
• with prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</span><br/>
• with moderate or severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)].</span> Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.<br/>
Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir:<br/>
• All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.<br/>
• Abacavir tablets are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients.<br/>
• Before starting abacavir tablets, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product. NEVER restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status.<br/>
• To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue abacavir immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).<br/>
• If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms which may include life-threatening hypotension and death can occur within hours.<br/>
• If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out, patients may restart abacavir. Rarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating abacavir therapy. Therefore, reintroduction of abacavir tablets or any other abacavir-containing product is recommended only if medical care can be readily accessed.<br/>
• A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about recognition of hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed with each new prescription and refill.</p><h3>Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly With Steatosis</h3><p class="First">Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abavcavir. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with abacavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.<br/>
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves'disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Myocardial Infarction</h3><p class="First">Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.<br/>
As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.<br/>
Serious and Fatal Abacavir-associated Hypersensitivity Reactions<br/>
In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)].</span> These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.<br/>
Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).<br/>
<span class="Bold">Additional Adverse Reactions with Use of Abacavir</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Therapy-Naive Adults:</span> Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 2<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 2. Treatment-emergent (All Causality) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity (Grades 2 to 4, Greater than or Equal to 5% Frequency) in Therapy-Naive Adults (CNA30024a) through 48 Weeks of Treatment.</span></p><p> <span class="Sup">a</span> This trial used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded     portion of the trial, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group.<br/>
<span class="Sup">b</span> Ten (3%) cases of suspected drug hypersensitivity were reclassified as not being due to abacavir following unblinding.<br/>
Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily compared with indinavir 800 mg 3 times daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily from CNA3005 are listed in Table 3.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 3. Treatment-emergent (All Causality) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity (Grades 2 to 4, Greater than or Equal to 5% Frequency) in Therapy-Naive Adults (CNA3005) through 48 Weeks of Treatment</span></p><p>Five subjects receiving abacavir in CNA3005 experienced worsening of pre-existing depression compared with none in the indinavir arm. The background rates of pre-existing depression were similar in the 2 treatment arms.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Abacavir Once Daily Versus Abacavir Twice Daily (CNA30021):</span> Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as at least moderate) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 600 mg once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily from CNA30021, were similar. For hypersensitivity reactions, subjects receiving abacavir once daily showed a rate of 9% in comparison with a rate of 7% for subjects receiving abacavir twice daily. However, subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily had this event.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Laboratory Abnormalities</span>: Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3 to 4) in therapy-naive adults during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine 150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily, lamivudine   150 mg twice daily, and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 4.<br/>

The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in CNA30021.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Therapy-Experienced Pediatric Subjects (Twice-daily Dosing)</span><br/>
Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with a greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with abacavir 8 mg per kg twice daily, lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily, and zidovudine 180 mg per m <span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily compared with lamivudine 4 mg per kg twice daily and zidovudine 180 mg per m <span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily from CNA3006 are listed in Table 6.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 6. Treatment-Emergent (All Causality) Adverse Reactions of at Least Moderate Intensity (Grades 2 to 4, Greater than or Equal to 5% Frequency) in Therapy-Experienced Pediatric Subjects (CNA3006) through 16 Weeks of Treatment</span></p><p> <span class="Italics">Laboratory Abnormalities</span>: In CNA3006, laboratory abnormalities (anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and CPK elevations) were observed with similar frequencies as in a trial of therapy-naive adults (CNA30024). Mild elevations of blood glucose were more frequent in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir (CNA3006) as compared with adult subjects (CNA30024).<br/>
<span class="Bold">Other Adverse Events</span><br/>
In addition to adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, other adverse reactions observed in the expanded access program were pancreatitis and increased GGT.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Pediatric Subjects Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677):</span> The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposures.<br/>

<br/>
Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases.<br/>
<br/>
There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>7. 1 Methadone</h3><p class="First">In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with  600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)].</span> This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span><br/>
There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir during pregnancy. Healthcare Providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Available data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks'gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.<br/>
In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical daily dose. However, no adverse developmental effects were observed following oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis, at exposures approximately 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Human Data:</span> Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 2,000 exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1,000 exposed in the first trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.0% to 4.1%) following first trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens and 2.7% (95% CI: 1.9% to 3.7%) following second/third trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens.<br/>
Abacavir has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)].</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> Abacavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 100, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 125, 350, or 700 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on gestation Days 6 through 17 and 6 through 20, respectively). Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. In a fertility and early embryo-fetal development study conducted in rats (at 60, 160, or 500 mg per kg per day), embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) or toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In pregnant rabbits, no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span> <br/>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir tablets.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of abacavir have been established in pediatric patients aged    3 months and older. Use of abacavir is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of abacavir in adults and pediatric subjects <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3), Clinical Studies ( 14.2)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of abacavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function</h3><p class="First">A dose reduction is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4)].</span> The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir is contraindicated in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no known specific treatment for overdose with abacavir. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required. It is not known whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.</p><h2>Abacavir Sulfate Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Abacavir sulfate, USP is a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against HIV-1. The chemical name of abacavir sulfate, USP is (1S,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-1-methanol sulfate (salt) (2:1). Abacavir sulfate, USP is the enantiomer with 1S, 4R absolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring. It has a molecular formula of (C14H18N6O)2•H2SO4 and a molecular weight of 670.74 daltons. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Abacavir sulfate, USP is a white to off-white powder. Soluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol. It has an octanol per water (pH 3.3) partition coefficient (log <span class="Italics">P</span>) of approximately 1 by UV-spectrometry at 25°C.<br/>
Abacavir tablets, USP are for oral administration. Each tablet contains abacavir sulfate, USP equivalent to 300 mg of abacavir as active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate. The tablets are coated with opadry yellow which contains hypromellose, titanium dioxide, triacetin, iron oxide yellow, polysorbate 80.<br/>
<span class="Italics">In vivo,</span> abacavir sulfate, USP dissociates to its free base, abacavir. All dosages for abacavir sulfate, USP are expressed in terms of abacavir.</p><h2>Abacavir Sulfate Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Abacavir is an antiretroviral agent <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology ( 12.4)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Adults</span><br/>
The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1,200 mg per day.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Absorption and Bioavailability:</span> Following oral administration, abacavir is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83%. Plasma abacavir AUC was similar following administration of the oral solution or tablets. After oral administration of 300 mg twice daily in 20 subjects, the steady-state peak serum abacavir concentration (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) was 3 ± 0.89 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC <span class="Sub">(0 to 12 h)</span> was 6.02 ± 1.73 mcg•hour per mL. After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects, C <span class="Sub">max</span> was 4.26 ± 1.19 mcg per mL (mean ± SD) and AUC <span class="Sub">∞</span> was 11.95 ± 2.51 mcg•hour per mL.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Distribution:</span> The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0.86 ± 0.15 L per kg, suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space. In 3 subjects, the CSF AUC <span class="Sub">(0 to 6 h)</span> to plasma abacavir AUC <span class="Sub">(0 to 6 h)</span> ratio ranged from 27% to 33%.<br/>
Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50% and was independent of concentration. Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentrations are identical, demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Elimination:</span> In single-dose trails, the observed elimination half-life (t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) was 1.54 ± 0.63 hours. After intravenous administration, total clearance was 0.80 ± 0.24 L per hour per kg (mean ± SD).<br/>
<span class="Italics">Metabolism :</span> In humans, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase to form the 5'-carboxylic acid and glucuronyl transferase to form the 5'-glucuronide. The metabolites do not have antiviral activity. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> experiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Excretion:</span>Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600-mg dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-abacavir: 99% of the radioactivity was recovered, 1.2% was excreted in the urine as abacavir, 30% as the 5'-carboxylic acid metabolite, 36% as the 5'-glucuronide metabolite, and 15% as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16% of the dose. <br/>
<span class="Bold">Special Populations<br/></span> <span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment:</span> The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function. Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment:</span> The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A). Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89% in the abacavir AUC and an increase of 58% in the half-life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir. The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease; however, the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased. <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6)].</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Pregnant Women</span>: Abacavir: Abacavir pharmacokinetics were studied in 25 pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Abacavir exposure (AUC) during pregnancy was similar to those in postpartum and in HIV-infected non-pregnant historical controls. Consistent with passive diffusion of abacavir across the placenta, abacavir concentrations in neonatal plasma cord samples at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients:</span> The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied after either single or repeat doses of abacavir in 169 pediatric subjects. Subjects receiving abacavir oral solution according to the recommended dosage regimen achieved plasma concentrations of abacavir similar to adults. Subjects receiving abacavir oral tablets achieved higher plasma concentrations of abacavir than subjects receiving oral solution.<br/>
The pharmacokinetics of abacavir dosed once daily in HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects aged 3 months through 12 years was evaluated in 3 trials (PENTA 13 [n = 14], PENTA 15 [n = 18], and ARROW [n = 36]). All 3 trials were 2-period, crossover, open-label pharmacokinetic trials of twice- versus once-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine. For the oral solution as well as the tablet formulation, these 3 trials demonstrated that once-daily dosing provides comparable AUC <span class="Sub">0 to 24</span> to twice-daily dosing of abacavir at the same total daily dose. The mean C <span class="Sub">max</span> was approximately 1.6- to 2.3-fold higher with abacavir once-daily dosing compared with twice-daily dosing.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span>: The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have not been studied in subjects older than 65 years.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients:</span> A population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV-1-infected male (n = 304) and female (n = 67) subjects showed no gender differences in abacavir AUC normalized for lean body weight.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Racial Groups</span>: There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences between blacks and whites in abacavir pharmacokinetics.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Effect of Abacavir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents:</span> In human liver microsomes, abacavir did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoforms (2C9, 2D6, 3A4). Based on these data, it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur between abacavir and drugs metabolized through these pathways.<br/>
Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study results, abacavir at therapeutic drug exposures is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the following transporters: organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1/3, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic cation transporter (OCT)1, OCT2, or multidrug and toxic extrusion protein (MATE)1 and MATE2-K.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Abacavir: In vitro,</span> abacavir is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OAP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, MATE1, MATE2-K, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2 or MRP4; therefore, drugs that modulate these transporters are not expected to affect abacavir plasma concentrations. Abacavir is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp <span class="Italics">in vitro;</span> however, considering its absolute bioavailability (83%), modulators of these transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on abacavir concentrations.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Lamivudine and/or Zidovudine:</span> Fifteen HIV-1-infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover-designed drug interaction trial evaluating single doses of abacavir (600 mg), lamivudine (150 mg), and zidovudine (300 mg) alone or in combination. Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine. Lamivudine exposure (AUC decreased 15%) and zidovudine exposure (AUC increased 10%) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Ethanol:</span> Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol. Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure. Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and ethanol via alcohol dehydrogenase, the pharmacokinetic interaction between abacavir and ethanol was studied in 24 HIV-1-infected male subjects. Each subject received the following treatments on separate occasions: a single 600-mg dose of abacavir, 0.7 g per kg ethanol (equivalent to 5 alcoholic drinks), and abacavir 600 mg plus 0.7 g per kg ethanol. Coadministration of ethanol and abacavir resulted in a 41% increase in abacavir AUC <span class="Sub">∞</span> and a 26% increase in abacavir t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>. Abacavir had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol, so no clinically significant interaction is expected in men. This interaction has not been studied in females.<br/>
<span class="Italics">Methadone:</span> In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy (40 mg and 90 mg daily), with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased 22% (90% CI: 6% to 42%). This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7)].</span> The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity</span><br/>
The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including primary monocytes/macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). EC <span class="Sub">50</span> values ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 μM (1 microM = 0.28 mcg per mL) and 0.07 to 1 microM against HIV-1 <span class="Sub">IIIB</span> and HIV-1 <span class="Sub">BaL</span>, respectively, and the mean EC <span class="Sub">50</span> value was 0.26 ± 0.18 microM against 8 clinical isolates. The median EC <span class="Sub">50</span> values of abacavir were 344 nM (range: 14.8 to 676 nM), 16.9 nM (range: 5.9 to 27.9 nM), 8.1 nM (range: 1.5 to 16.7 nM), 356 nM (range: 35.7 to 396 nM), 105 nM (range: 28.1 to 168 nM), 47.6 nM (range: 5.2 to 200 nM), 51.4 nM (range: 7.1 to 177 nM), and 282 nM (range: 22.4 to 598 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC <span class="Sub">50</span> values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4), ranged from 0.024 to 0.49 microM. The antiviral activity of abacavir in cell culture was not antagonized when combined with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine or zidovudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) nevirapine, or the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir. Ribavirin (50 microM) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection had no effect on the anti–HIV-1 activity of abacavir in cell culture.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Resistance</span><br/>
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir-treated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I emerged in HIV-1 RT. M184V or I substitutions resulted in an approximately 2-fold decrease in susceptibility to abacavir. Substitutions K65R, L74M, or Y115F with M184V or I conferred a 7- to 8-fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility, and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility.<br/>
Thirty-nine percent (7 of 18) of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once-daily arm had a greater than 2.5-fold mean decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median-fold decrease of 1.3 (range 0.5 to 11) compared with 29% (5 of 17) of the failure isolates in the twice-daily arm with a median-fold decrease of 0.92 (range 0.7 to 13).<br/>
<span class="Bold">Cross-Resistance</span><br/>
Cross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. Isolates containing abacavir resistance-associated substitutions, namely, K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V, exhibited cross-resistance to didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir in cell culture and in subjects. An increasing number of thymidine analogue mutation substitutions (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219E/R/H/Q/N) is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenicity</span><br/>
Abacavir was administered orally at 3 dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and non-malignant tumors. Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species, and in the liver of female rats. In addition, non-malignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats. These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 600 mg.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Mutagenicity</span><br/>
Abacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> cytogenetic study in human lymphocytes. Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation, although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay. Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.<br/>
Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
Abacavir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at a dose associated with exposures (AUC) approximately 3.3 times (male) or 4.1 times (female) those in humans at the clinically recommended dose.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Myocardial degeneration was found in mice and rats following administration of abacavir for 2 years. The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic exposure in humans at a dose of 600 mg. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Adult Trials</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Therapy-Naive Adults</span><br/>

<span class="Bold">Once-Daily Dosing</span><br/>
ARROW (COL105677) was a 5-year randomized, multicenter trial which evaluated multiple aspects of clinical management of HIV-1 infection in pediatric subjects. HIV-1–infected, treatment-naive subjects aged 3 months to 17 years were enrolled and treated with a first-line regimen containing abacavir and lamivudine, dosed twice daily according to World Health Organization recommendations. After a minimum of 36 weeks of treatment, subjects were given the option to participate in Randomization 3 of the ARROW trial, comparing the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, in combination with a third antiretroviral drug, for an additional 96 weeks. Of the 1,206 original ARROW subjects, 669 participated in Randomization 3. Virologic suppression was not a requirement for participation at baseline for Randomization 3 (following a minimum of 36 weeks of twice-daily treatment), 75% of subjects in the twice-daily cohort were virologically suppressed compared with 71% of subjects in the once-daily cohort.<br/>
The proportions of subjects with HIV-1 RNA less than 80 copies per mL through 96 weeks are shown in Table 11. The differences between virologic responses in the two treatment arms were comparable across baseline characteristics for gender and age.<br/>
