<li><strong>Low white blood cell count (neutropenia).</strong> Low white blood cell counts are common with Trodelvy and can sometimes be severe and lead to infections that can be life-threatening. Your healthcare provider should check your blood cell counts during treatment. If your white blood cell count is too low, your healthcare provider may need to lower your dose, give you a medicine to help prevent low blood cell count with future doses, or in some cases may stop treatment. Your healthcare provider may need to give you antibiotic medicines if you develop fever while your white blood cell count is low. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of the following signs of infection during treatment:
<ul>
<li>fever</li>
<li>chills</li>

If you lose too much body fluids (dehydration) your healthcare provider may need to give you fluids and electrolytes to replace body salts. If diarrhea happens later in your treatment, your healthcare provider may check you to see if the diarrhea may be caused by an infection. Your healthcare provider may decrease your dose or stop treatment if your diarrhea is severe and cannot be controlled with anti-diarrheal medicines.<br/>
