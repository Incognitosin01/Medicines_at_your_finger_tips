The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.</p><p>Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and Hib bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, meningitis, epiglottitis, pericarditis, septic arthritis) are serious diseases that can cause life-threatening illnesses.

The chance of your child catching one of these diseases, and being permanently injured or dying as a result, is much greater than the chance of your child getting a serious side effect from the vaccine.</p><p>This vaccine is recommended for children 6 weeks through 4 years of age (before the child's 5th birthday).</p><p>This vaccine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using dtap, hepatitis b, poliovirus, and haemophilus b vaccine</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
