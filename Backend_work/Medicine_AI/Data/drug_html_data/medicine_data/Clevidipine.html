As blood pressure approaches goal, dose increases should be less than doubling and intervals between dose adjustments should increase to every 5 to 10 minutes.  An increase of approximately 1 to 2 mg/hour generally produces an additional 2 to 4 mmHg decrease in systolic pressure.<br/><br/>Maintenance dose: The desired therapeutic response for most patients occurs at doses of 4 to 6 mg/hour.  Patients with severe hypertension may require doses up to 32 mg/hour.<br/><br/>Maximum dose: Most patients were treated with maximum doses of 16 mg/hour or less; however, there is limited short-term experience with doses up to 32 mg/hour.  Due to lipid load restrictions, no more than 1000 mL (or an average of 21 mg/hour) is recommended per 24-hour period.<br/><br/>Duration of therapy: There is little experience with infusion durations beyond 72 hours at any dose.<br/><br/>Transition to an oral antihypertensive agent: Discontinue this drug or titrate downward while appropriate oral treatment is established.<br/><br/>Use: Reduction of blood pressure when oral treatment is not feasible or not desirable.<br/><br/></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">What other drugs will affect clevidipine?</h2><p>If you have been using a beta-blocker medication (such as atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, nebivolol, propranolol, sotalol, and others), you should not stop using it suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose. Stopping a beta-blocker too quickly can cause serious heart problems that will not be prevented by clevidipine.</p><p>Other drugs may affect clevidipine, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any medicine you start or stop using.</p><h2>More about clevidipine</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
