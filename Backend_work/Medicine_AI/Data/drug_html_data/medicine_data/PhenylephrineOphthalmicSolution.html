Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2.5% should be used in these patients.</p><h3>Pediatric Patients Less Than 1 Year of Age</h3><p class="First">Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 10% is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age due to the increased risk of systemic toxicity. Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2.5% should be used in these patients <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Topical Ophthalmic Use Only</h3><p class="First">Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2.5% and 10% is not indicated for injection.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Reactions</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of serious cardiovascular reactions, including ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial infarctions, in patients using phenylephrine 10%. These episodes, some fatal, have usually occurred in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, USP 2.5% should be used in these patients.</p><h3>Elevation of Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">A significant elevation in blood pressure is not common but has been reported following conjunctival instillation of recommended doses of phenylephrine 10%. The risk is less with phenylephrine 2.5%. Caution should be exercised with the use of phenylephrine 10% in pediatric patients less than 5 years of age and patients with hyperthyroidism, or cardiovascular disease. The post-treatment blood pressure of patients with cardiac and endocrine diseases and any patients who develop symptoms should be carefully monitored.</p><h3>Rebound Miosis</h3><p class="First">Rebound miosis has been reported one day after receiving phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, and re-instillation of the drug produced a lesser mydriatic effect.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Cardiovascular Effects [<span class="Italics">See Warnings and Precautions (5.2</span>)]</li>
<li>Elevation in Blood Pressure [<span class="Italics">See Warnings and Precautions (5.3</span>)]</li>
</ul><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified following use of phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h3>Ocular Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Eye pain and stinging on instillation, temporary blurred vision and photophobia, and conjunctival sensitization may occur.</p><h3>Systemic Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">A marked increase in blood pressure has been reported particularly, but not limited to low weight premature neonates, infants and hypertensive patients.</p><p>Cardiovascular effects which have been seen primarily in hypertensive patients following topical ocular use of phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 10% include marked increase in blood pressure, syncope, myocardial infarction, tachycardia, arrhythmia and subarachnoid hemorrhage [<span class="Italics">See Warnings and Precautions (5.2 and 5.3</span>)].</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Agents That May Exaggerate Pressor Responses</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of phenylephrine and atropine may enhance the pressor effects and induce tachycardia in some patients. Phenylephrine may potentiate the cardiovascular depressant effects of some inhalation anesthetic agents.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with topical phenylephrine. It is also not known whether phenylephrine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Phenylephrine hydrochloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2.5% and 10% is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 10% is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age [<span class="Italics">See Contraindications (4.2)</span>].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of phenylephrine may cause a rapid rise in blood pressure. It may also cause headache, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting, and ventricular arrhythmias. Prompt injection of a rapidly acting alpha-adrenergic blocking agent such as phentolamine has been recommended.</p><h2>Phenylephrine Ophthalmic Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, USP is a sterile, clear, colorless, topical α-adrenergic agonist for ophthalmic use. The active ingredient is represented by the chemical structure</p><p>Chemical Name: (R)-3-hydroxy-α[(methylamino)methyl]benzenemethanol hydrochloride.</p><p>Molecular Formula: C<span class="Sub">9</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span>.HCl</p><p>Molecular Weight: 203.67 g/mol</p><p>Each mL of Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, USP 2.5% contains: ACTIVE: Phenylephrine Hydrochloride 25 mg (2.5%); INACTIVES: Sodium Phosphate Monobasic, Sodium Phosphate Dibasic, Water for Injection.

Phosphoric Acid and/or Sodium Hydroxide may be added to adjust pH (4.0 to 7.5). The solution has a tonicity of 985 mOsm/kg; PRESERVATIVE: Benzalkonium Chloride 0.1 mg (0.01%).</p><h2>Phenylephrine Ophthalmic Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Phenylephrine hydrochloride is an α-1 adrenergic agonist drug that is used in ophthalmology mainly for its mydriatic effect. After topical application to the conjunctiva, phenylephrine acts directly on α-adrenergic receptors in the eye, producing contraction of the dilator muscle of the pupil and constriction of the arterioles in the conjunctiva.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Maximal mydriasis occurs in 20 to 90 minutes with recovery after 3 to 8 hours.</p><p>Systemic absorption of sufficient quantities of phenylephrine may lead to systemic α-adrenergic effects, such as rise in blood pressure which may be accompanied by a reflex atropine-sensitive bradycardia.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The systemic exposure following topical administration of phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution has not been studied. A higher systemic absorption is expected for the 10% solution than the 2.5% solution and when the corneal barrier function is compromised.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Pupillary dilation following topical administration of phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution has been demonstrated in controlled clinical studies in adults and pediatric patients with different levels of iris pigmentation. Pupil movement is generally seen within 15 minutes, maximal mydriasis between 20 to 90 minutes and recovery after 3 to 8 hours. Darker irides tend to dilate slower than lighter irides.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution, USP 2.5% is supplied as a sterile, aqueous, topical ophthalmic solution in an opaque, white low density polyethylene (LDPE) bottle with a natural LDPE dropper tip and red cap in the following sizes:</p><p>NDC 17478-201-02         2 mL in 6 cc bottle<br/>
