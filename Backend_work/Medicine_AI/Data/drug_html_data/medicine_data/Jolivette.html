Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Carefully follow your doctor's dosing instructions about when to start taking Jolivette for contraception if you are switching from a combination birth control pill (estrogen and progestin).</p><p>If you take Jolivette for contraception: Take one pill every day, no more than 24 hours apart. You may get pregnant if you do not take one pill daily.</p><p>You may need to use back-up birth control (such as condoms with spermicide) if you are sick with vomiting or diarrhea, or if you are 3 or more hours late in taking your daily dose.</p><p>If you take Jolivette for menstrual disorders or abnormal vaginal bleeding: You will most likely take the medicine for only 5 to 10 days. Vaginal bleeding will occur 3 to 7 days after your last dose.</p><p>If you take Jolivette for endometriosis: This medicine is usually taken daily long-term for several months. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.</p><p>Your doctor should check your progress on a regular basis. Self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis, and have regular mammograms.</p><p><b>Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away.</b></p><p>Jolivette can affect the results of certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using this medicine.</p><p>Store this medication at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions, or follow the patient instructions provided with your medicine.</p><p>Missing a birth control pill increases your risk of becoming pregnant. If you are more than 3 hours late for your dose, take the medicine as soon as you remember and use back-up birth control for at least 48 hours. Take your next pill at the regularly scheduled time and continue on your regular dosing schedule.</p><p><b>If you miss a period for two months in a row, call your doctor because you might be pregnant.</b></p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>An overdose of  Jolivette is not expected to be dangerous.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking norethindrone?</h2><p>Do not use estrogen medication unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p><b>Avoid smoking.</b> It can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack while taking Jolivette for contraception.</p><p>Jolivette will not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases--including HIV and AIDS.
