You will receive a total of 4 implants.</p><p>After the implants are inserted, your arm will be covered with 2 bandages. Remove the top bandage after 24 hours, but leave the smaller bandage on for 3 to 5 days. Keep the area clean and dry. Apply an ice pack to the area every 2 hours during the first day, leaving the ice pack on for 40 minutes at a time.</p><p>For at least 1 week, check the incision area for warmth, redness, swelling, or other signs of infection.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you notice any of the following symptoms after the implants are inserted:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an implant sticks out of your skin or comes out by itself;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>you have numbness or weakness in your arm; or</p>
