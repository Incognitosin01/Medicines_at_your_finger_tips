These bacteria can infect the spinal cord and brain, causing meningitis that can be fatal. Meningococcal disease can also lead to permanent and disabling medical problems.</p><p>Meningococcal disease can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The bacteria can also be passed through contact with objects the infected person has touched, such as a door handle or other surface. The bacteria can also be passed through kissing, or sharing a drinking glass or eating utensil with an infected person.</p><p>Meningococcal disease is more likely to occur in babies younger than 1 year, in young people ages 16 to 23 years, in anyone with a weak immune system, and in anyone exposed to an outbreak of the disease.</p><p>Menveo works by exposing you to a small dose of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes your body to develop immunity to the disease. Menveo contains four of the most common types of meningococcal bacteria (serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135).</p><p>Meningococcal vaccine will not treat an active meningococcal infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Menveo is for use in children and adults between the ages of 2 months and 55 years old.</p><p>Like any vaccine, Menveo may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive Menveo if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a meningococcal or diphtheria vaccine.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>If you have any of these other conditions, your Menveo vaccination may need to be postponed or not given at all:</p><ul>

</li>

In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving Menveo.</p><p>It is not known whether Menveo will harm an unborn baby. However, if you are pregnant, your doctor should determine whether you need this vaccine.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry.

Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Menveo vaccine should not be given to anyone younger than 2 months or older than 65 years of age.</p><h2>How is Menveo given?</h2><p>Menveo is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle.

For children aged 2 through 5 years at continued high risk of meningococcal disease, a second dose may be administered 2 months after the first dose.</p><p>Menveo is usually given only once to adults and children who are aged 11 years through to 55 year.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control recommends that all teens ages 11 to 12 years be vaccinated with a single dose of Menveo. A booster dose should be given at age 16 for continued protection when teens are at highest risk of meningococcal disease.</p><p>Your booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by your local health department.</p><p>Be sure to receive all recommended doses of Menveo or you may not be fully protected against disease.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Meningococcal Meningitis Prophylaxis:</b></p><p>0.5 mL intramuscularly once</p><p><b>Usual Pediatric Dose for Meningococcal Meningitis Prophylaxis:</b></p><p>2 years or older:<br/>
