Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Decreased bone mineral density: In clinical trials, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with decreases in bone mineral density in HIV-1 infected adults and increases in bone metabolism markers. Serum parathyroid hormone and 1,25 vitamin D levels were also higher. Consider monitoring of bone density in adults with a history of pathologic fractures or with other risk factors for bone loss or osteoporosis. Consider calcium and vitamin D supplementation for all patients; effect of supplementation has not been studied, but may be beneficial. Long-term bone health and fracture risk are unknown. If abnormalities are suspected, expert assessment is recommended.</p><p>• Immune reconstitution syndrome: Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome resulting in the occurrence of an inflammatory response to an indolent or residual opportunistic infection during initial HIV treatment or activation of autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis) later in therapy; further evaluation and treatment may be required.</p><p>• Osteomalacia and renal dysfunction: May cause osteomalacia with proximal renal tubulopathy. Bone pain, extremity pain, fractures, arthralgias, weakness, and muscle pain have been reported. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms should be evaluated for hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia.</p><p>• Renal toxicity: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may cause renal toxicity (acute renal failure and/or Fanconi syndrome); avoid use with concurrent or recent nephrotoxic therapy (including high dose or multiple NSAID use). Acute renal failure has occurred in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal impairment who were on a stable tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimen to which a high dose or multiple NSAID therapy was added. Consider alternatives to NSAIDS in patients taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and at risk for renal impairment. Assess serum creatinine, estimated CrCl, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients prior to initiation of therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus. IDSA guidelines recommend discontinuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (and substituting with alternative antiretroviral therapy) in HIV-infected patients who develop a decline in GFR (a &gt;25% decrease in GFR from baseline and to a level of &lt;60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) during use, particularly in presence of proximal tubular dysfunction (eg, euglycemic glycosuria, increased urinary phosphorus excretion and hypophosphatemia, proteinuria [new onset or worsening]) (IDSA [Lucas 2014]).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Chronic hepatitis B: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1, following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy.</b> <b>Closely monitor hepatic function in these patients; if appropriate, antihepatitis B therapy may be warranted</b>, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis. All patients with HIV should be tested for HBV prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Do not use in patients with CrCl &lt;50 mL/minute.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CD4 count, viral load; liver function tests, serum creatinine, urine glucose, urine protein (prior to initiation and as clinically indicated during therapy); serum phosphorous (in patients with chronic kidney disease); bone density (patients with a history of bone fracture or have risk factors for bone loss); testing for HBV is recommended prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Patients with HIV and HBV coinfection should hepatic function monitored for several months following therapy discontinuation.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines consider information related to this fixed-dose combination insufficient to make recommendations for use in females living with HIV who are not yet pregnant but are trying to conceive (HHS [perinatal] 2019).</p><p>Refer to individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines consider information related to this fixed-dose combination insufficient to make recommendations for use in pregnant females living with HIV who are antiretroviral-naive, who have had antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the past but are restarting, who require a new ART regimen (due to poor tolerance or poor virologic response of current regimen), or who become pregnant while taking the regimen (HHS [perinatal] 2019).</p><p>Refer to individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat HIV infection.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
