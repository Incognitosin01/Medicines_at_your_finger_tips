The main differences between Vascepa and fish oil is that Vascepa only contains eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), whereas supplemental fish oils contain both EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). By only containing EPA, Vascepa reduces high triglycerides without raising levels of “bad” cholesterol or LDL-C. Vascepa is also up to four times stronger than most OTC fish oils, more expensive, carries a higher risk of bleeding and heart rythym disturbances, and is only available on prescription to people who meet certain criteria.</p><p> Continue reading</p><p>There are no documented reports that Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) helps with weight loss. Vascepa reduces triglyceride production in the liver and enhances the clearance of triglycerides from lipid particles, via a number of different mechanisms. Anecdotally, some blogs report weight loss with Vascepa, but this tends to correlate with the person experiencing side effects such excessive diarrhea or gastrointestinal discomfort. Any weight loss is more likely to be due to diet modification and increased physical activity which are both recommended when taking Vascepa. Continue reading</p><p>It takes approximately one year for Vascepa to start reducing a person's cardiovascular risk and up to almost five years for the full risk-reducing effects to be seen.  Laboratory results showed that Vascepa reduced triglycerides by a median of -39 mg/dL (or a drop of 18%) after one year whereas those assigned to placebo had an increase in triglycerides of 5 mg/dL (an increase of 2%). Continue reading</p><p>Hair thinning or loss (alopecia) is not listed as a side effect in data reviewed by the FDA for the approval of Vascepa. In some people, hair loss may be due to a medical condition, another medication, diet or stress levels. Contact your doctor for further advice. Continue reading</p><p>Yes, Vascepa does thin your blood, and people receiving Vascepa are at a slightly increased risk of bleeding with one trial showing 12% of people receiving Vascepa experienced a bleeding event compared with 10% of people receiving a placebo (an inactive pill). The risk of bleeding is higher in people who also take other medications or supplements that increase bleeding risk such as aspirin, clopidogrel, dabigatran, warfarin, NSAIDs, feverfew, ginkgo, garlic, or ginseng.</p><p> Continue reading</p><h2>More about Vascepa (icosapent)</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
