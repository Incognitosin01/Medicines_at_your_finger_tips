You may also notice increased growth or thickness of your eyelashes. These changes occur slowly and you may not notice them for months or years. Color changes may be permanent even after your treatment ends, and may occur only in the eye being treated. This could result in a cosmetic difference in eye or eyelash color from one eye to the other.</p><p>Rocklatan is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use  Rocklatan?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>The usual dose of this medicine is 1 drop into the affected eye every evening. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if you have an eye injury or eye infection, or if you plan to have eye surgery.</p><p>Do not use while wearing soft contact lenses. A preservative in this medicine could permanently stain the lenses. Use the medicine at least 15 minutes before inserting your contact lenses.</p><p>Wash your hands before using eye medication.</p><p>To apply the eye drops: Tilt your head back slightly and pull down your lower eyelid to create a small pocket. Hold the dropper above the eye and squeeze a drop into this pocket. Close your eyes for 1 or 2 minutes.</p><p>Use only the number of drops your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>Wait at least 5 minutes before using any other eye drops your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>Do not touch the tip of the eye dropper or place it directly on your eye. A contaminated dropper can infect your eye, which could lead to serious vision problems.</p><p>Store in the refrigerator. Protect from light and do not freeze. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Skip the missed dose and use the medicine at the next regularly scheduled time.
