<li>During episodes of hypoglycemia</li>
<li>In patients who are hypersensitive to HUMULIN R U-500 or any of its excipients.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hyperglycemia, Hypoglycemia or Death Due to Dosing Errors with the Vial Presentation</h3><p class="First">Medication errors associated with the HUMULIN R U-500 vial presentation resulting in patients experiencing hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia or death have been reported. The majority of errors occurred due to errors in dispensing, prescribing or administration. Attention to details at all levels may prevent these errors.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dispensing Errors</span></p><p>Instruct patients to always inspect insulin vials to confirm that the correct insulin is dispensed including the correct insulin brand and concentration.</p><p>The HUMULIN R U-500 vial, which contains 20 mL, has a band of aqua coloring, a 500 units/mL concentration statement consisting of white lettering on a green rectangular background, and a green “U-500” statement prominently displayed next to the trade name. Additionally, the vial has a green flip top and a red warning on the front panel describing the highly concentrated dose and a statement advising use with only U-500 insulin syringes.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Prescribing Errors</span></p><p>Dosing errors have occurred when the HUMULIN R U-500 dose was administered with syringes other than a U-500 insulin syringe. Patients should be prescribed U-500 syringes for use with the Humulin R U-500 vials. The prescribed dose of HUMULIN R U-500 should always be expressed in units of insulin <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Administration Errors</span></p><p>Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.</p><p>Use only a U-500 insulin syringe with HUMULIN R U-500 to avoid administration errors. Do not use any other type of syringe to administer Humulin R U-500. Adhere to administration instructions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]</span>.</p><p>Instruct the patient to inform hospital or emergency department staff of the dose of HUMULIN R U-500 prescribed, in the event of a future hospitalization or visit to the emergency department.</p><h3>Never Share a HUMULIN R U-500 KwikPen or U-500 Insulin Syringe Between Patients</h3><p class="First">HUMULIN R U-500 KwikPens should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using HUMULIN R U-500 vials should never share needles or U-500 insulin syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.</p><h3>5.3 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen</h3><p class="First">Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span> or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><p>Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, adjustments in concomitant oral anti-diabetic treatment may be needed.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Severe hypoglycemia may develop as long as 18 to 24 hours after an injection of HUMULIN R U-500. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving, or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3, 7.4)]</span>, or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulation. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMULIN R U-500 may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4)]</span>. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia do not administer Humulin R U-500 intravenously, intramuscularly or in an insulin pump or dilute or mix Humulin R U-500 with any other insulin products or solutions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including HUMULIN R U-500 <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMULIN R U-500; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">All insulin products, including HUMULIN R U-500, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Use caution in patients who may be at risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).</p><h3>Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists</h3><p class="First">Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</li>
<li>Hypokalemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p>The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HUMULIN R U-500. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Allergic Reactions</span></p><p>Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500 and may be life threatening.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lipodystrophy</span></p><p>Long-term use of insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue) and may affect insulin absorption. Rotate insulin injections sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Localized Cutaneous Amyloidosis</span></p><p>Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Injection Site Reactions</span></p><p>Patients taking HUMULIN R U-500 may experience injection site reactions, including injection site hematoma, pain, hemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discoloration, pruritus, warmth, and injection site mass.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Weight Gain</span></p><p>Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy, including HUMULIN R U-500, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Peripheral Edema</span></p><p>Insulin, including HUMULIN R U-500, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>As with all therapeutic proteins, insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. The presence of antibodies that affect clinical efficacy may necessitate dose adjustments to correct for tendencies toward hyper- or hypoglycemia.</p><p>The incidence of antibody formation with HUMULIN R U-500 is unknown.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">The risk of hypoglycemia associated with HUMULIN R U-500 use may be increased with antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, pramlintide, salicylates, somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide), and sulfonamide antibiotics. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN R U-500 is co-administered with these drugs.</p><h3>Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMULIN R U-500</h3><p class="First">The glucose lowering effect of HUMULIN R U-500 may be decreased when co-administered with atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, estrogens, glucagon, isoniazid, niacin, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., albuterol, epinephrine, terbutaline) and thyroid hormones. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN R U-500 is co-administered with these drugs.</p><h3>Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMULIN R U-500</h3><p class="First">The glucose lowering effect of HUMULIN R U-500 may be increased or decreased when co-administered with alcohol, beta-blockers, clonidine, and lithium salts. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia. Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMULIN R U-500 is co-administered with these drugs.</p><h3>Drugs That May Affect Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span> may be blunted when beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine are co-administered with HUMULIN R U-500.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from published studies over decades have not established an association with human insulin use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (<span class="Italics">see</span> Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (<span class="Italics">see</span> Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies were not performed.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c &gt;7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a HbA1c &gt;10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Human Data</span></p><p>While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, published data from retrospective studies, open-label, randomized, parallel studies and meta-analyses over decades have not established an association with human insulin use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. All available studies have methodological limitations, including lack of blinding, unclear methods or randomization, and small sample size.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from published literature suggests that exogenous human insulin products, including HUMULIN R, are transferred into human milk. There are no adverse reactions reported in breastfed infants in the literature. There are no data on the effects of exogenous human insulin products, including HUMULIN R on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for HUMULIN R and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HUMULIN R or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">There are no well-controlled studies of use of HUMULIN R U-500 in children. Standard precautions as applied to use of HUMULIN R U-500 in adults are appropriate for use in children. As in adults, the dosage of HUMULIN R U-500 in pediatric patients must be individualized based on metabolic needs and results of frequent monitoring of blood glucose.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HUMULIN R U-500 has not been studied. Caution should be exercised when HUMULIN R U-500 is administered to geriatric patients. In elderly patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemia.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required in patients with renal impairment.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Frequent glucose monitoring and insulin dose reduction may be required in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately.</p><h2>Humulin R U-500 Description</h2><p class="First">HUMULIN R U-500 (insulin human injection) is a human insulin solution used to lower blood glucose. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>. HUMULIN R has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">257</span>H<span class="Sub">383</span>N<span class="Sub">65</span>O<span class="Sub">77</span>S<span class="Sub">6</span> with a molecular weight of 5808.</p><p>HUMULIN R U-500 is a sterile, aqueous, and colorless solution. HUMULIN R U-500 contains 500 units of insulin in each milliliter. Each milliliter of HUMULIN R U-500 also contains glycerin 16 mg, metacresol 2.5 mg, zinc oxide to supplement the endogenous zinc to obtain a total zinc content of 0.017 mg/100 units, and Water for Injection. Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid may be added during manufacture to adjust the pH.</p><h2>Humulin R U-500 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins, including HUMULIN R U-500. Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhance protein synthesis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a euglycemic clamp study of 24 healthy obese subjects (BMI=30-39 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), single doses of HUMULIN R U-500 at 50 units (0.4-0.6 unit/kg) and 100 units (0.8-1.3 unit/kg) resulted in a mean time of onset of action of less than 15 minutes at both doses and a mean duration of action of 21 hours (range 13-24 hours). The time action characteristics reflect both prandial and basal activity, consistent with clinical experience. This effect has been attributed to the high concentration of the preparation.</p><p>Figure 1 should be considered a representative example since the time course of action of insulin may vary in different individuals or within the same individual. The rate of insulin absorption and consequently the onset of activity is known to be affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 1: Mean Insulin Activity Versus Time Profiles After Subcutaneous Injection of a 100 U Dose of HUMULIN R U-500 in Healthy Obese Subjects</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span> — In a euglycemic clamp study of 24 healthy obese subjects, the median peak insulin level occurred between 4 hours (50 unit dose) and 8 hours (100 unit dose) with a range of 0.5-8 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span> — The uptake and degradation of insulin occurs predominantly in liver, kidney, muscle, and adipocytes, with the liver being the major organ involved in the clearance of insulin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span> — Mean apparent half-life after subcutaneous administration of single doses of 50 units and 100 units to healthy obese subjects (N≥21) was approximately 4.5 hours (range=1.9-10 hours) for HUMULIN R U-500.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 2: Mean Serum Insulin Concentrations Versus Time After Subcutaneous Injection of a 100 U Dose of HUMULIN R U-500 Healthy Obese Subjects</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity and fertility studies were not performed with HUMULIN R U-500 in animals.

<li><span class="Bold">When using the Humulin R U-500 KwikPen:</span> The Humulin R U-500 KwikPen is specially made to dial and deliver doses of Humulin R U-500 insulin. <span class="Bold">Do not</span> use any syringe to remove Humulin R U-500 from your Humulin R U-500 KwikPen. The markings on certain syringes will not measure your dose correctly. A severe overdose can happen, causing low blood sugar, which may put your life in danger.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">When using the Humulin R U-500 vial: There is a special U-500 insulin syringe to measure Humulin R U-500. Use only a U-500 insulin syringe to draw up and inject your Humulin R U-500.</span> If you do not use the right syringe type, you may take the wrong dose of Humulin R U-500. This can cause you to have too low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or too high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Your healthcare provider should show you how to draw up Humulin R U-500.</li>
<li>Use Humulin R U-500 <span class="Bold">30 minutes</span> before eating a meal.</li>
<li>Inject Humulin R U-500 under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, buttocks or stomach area (abdomen). <span class="Bold">Do not</span> use Humulin R U-500 in an insulin pump or inject Humulin R U-500 into your vein (intravenously) or your muscle (intramuscularly).</li>
