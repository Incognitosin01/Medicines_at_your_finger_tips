</ul><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment.</p><p>Patients with electrolyte abnormalities should have them corrected before treatment with GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP. In addition, use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment.[See Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]</p><h3>5.2 Seizures</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures with the use of large volume (4 liter) PEG-based colon preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p>Use caution when prescribing the GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, patients with known or suspected hyponatremia, or patients using concomitant medications (such as diuretics) that increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities. Monitor baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients.</p><h3>5.3 Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Patients with impaired water handling who experience severe vomiting should be closely monitored including measurement of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, BUN and creatinine). Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients.</p><h3>5.4 Cardiac Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g. patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.</p><h3>5.5 Ischemic Colitis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> There have been reports of ischemic colitis in patients with use of GaviLyte - H and 20 mg bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP and GaviLyte - H and 10 mg bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP. If patients develop severe abdominal pain or rectal bleeding, patients should be evaluated as soon as possible.</p><h3>5.6 Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP</p><p>Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.</p><h3>5.7 Aspiration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Such patients should be observed during administration of the GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP solution.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><h3>6.1 Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In a clinical study of GaviLyte - H and (5 mg vs. 10 mg) bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP,  overall discomfort, abdominal fullness, abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting, were the most common adverse reactions (&gt;3%). The data in Table 1 reflects the 154 patients that received GaviLyte - H and 5 mg bisacodyl tablet vs. the 154 patients that received GaviLyte - H and 10 mg bisacodyl tablets. The GaviLyte - H and 5 mg bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP  population was 29-87 years of age, 49% male, 51% female, 13% African American, 83% White, 5% Hispanic requiring a colonoscopy. The demographics of the comparator group were similar.</p><h3>6.2 Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Allergic Reactions:</span><br/>
Cases of urticaria, rhinorrhea, dermatitis and anaphylactic reactions have been reported with PEG-based products.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span><br/>
There are isolated reports of serious post-marketing events following the administration of PEG-based products in patients over 60 years of age. These adverse reactions include upper GI bleeding from a Mallory-Weiss tear, esophageal perforation, asystole, and acute pulmonary edema after vomiting and aspirating the PEG-based solution. In addition, during administration of 4 liters of PEG-3350 colon cleansing preparation the following serious adverse reactions were seen: two deaths in end stage renal failure patients who developed diarrhea, vomiting and dysnatremia <span class="Italics">[</span>see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3) <span class="Italics">].</span></p><p>Ischemic colitis has been reported with use of of GaviLyte - H and 20 mg and 10 mg bisacodyl delayed-release tablets, USP for colon preparation prior to colonoscopy. However, a causal relationship between these ischemic colitis cases and the use of GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablets, USP has not been established.</p><p><span class="Italics">Neurologic:</span><br/>
There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with use of large volume (4 liter) PEG-based colon preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. Cases of dizziness and syncope have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] <span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><h3>7.1 Drugs That May Increase Risks of Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP for patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and prolonged QT in the setting of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)] in patients taking these concomitant medications.</p><h3>7.2 Potential for Altered Drug Absorption</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of GaviLyte - H  solution may be flushed from the GI tract and the medication may not be absorbed completely.</p><h3>7.3 Interaction with Antacids</h3><p class="First">Do not take the bisacodyl delayed-release tablet within one hour of taking an antacid.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3><span class="Bold"><br/>
8.1 Pregnancy</span></h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Pregnancy Category C animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. It is not known whether GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP should be given to a pregnant or nursing woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>8.3 Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Of the 148 patients who took GaviLyte - H and 5 mg bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP in clinical trials, 42 (28%) were 65 years of age or older, while 10 (7%) were 75 years of age or older. The rates of success appear to be lower in patients 65 years and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14)] <span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Using more than the recommended dosage of bisacodyl in conjunction with GaviLyte - H solution increases the frequency of common adverse events and may increase the risk of ischemic colitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5)] <span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP consists of PEG-3350, an osmotic laxative and bisacodyl, a stimulant laxative.

</ul><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3><span class="Bold"><br/>
12.1 Mechanism of Action</span></h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is an osmotic agent, causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Bisacodyl is hydrolyzed by intestinal brush border enzymes and colonic bacteria to form an active metabolite [bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl) pyridyl-2 methane; (BHPM)] that acts directly on the colonic mucosa to produce colonic peristalsis.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The stimulant laxative effect of bisacodyl, together with the osmotic effect of the unabsorbed PEG when ingested with a large volume of water, produces watery diarrhea.</p><h3>12.3 PharmacoKinetics</h3><p class="First">When taken orally, PEG 3350 is minimally absorbed.</p><p>Bisacodyl, which is a prodrug, is converted to its active metabolite BHPM by intestinal brush border enzymes and colonic bacteria. The pharmacokinetics of bisacodyl following oral administration of the bisacodyl tablet has not been adequately characterized.</p><h2>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3><span class="Bold"><br/>
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP. Studies to evaluate its potential for impairment of fertility or its mutagenic potential have not been performed.</p><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> The colon cleansing efficacy of GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP (with 5 mg of bisacodyl) was evaluated in a randomized, single blind (endoscopist only), active-controlled, multicenter study. In this study, 293 adult patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 87 years old (mean age 55 years old) with 55% female and 45% male patients. Race was distributed as follows: 83% White, 12% African American, 8% Hispanic or Latino, and 4% other.</p><p>Patients were randomized to one of the following two colon preparations: 1) GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP [10 mg of bisacodyl tablets were given at noon on the day before colonoscopy followed by 2 liters of GaviLyte - H (after the first bowel movement or maximum of 6 hours)] at a rate of 8 ounces every 10 minutes and 2) a modified GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP [containing a 5 mg bisacodyl tablet given at noon on the day before colonoscopy followed by 2 liters of GaviLyte - H (after the first bowel movement or maximum of 6 hours)] at a rate of 8 ounces every 10 minutes.</p><p>Patients were instructed to refrain from solid food and to have clear liquids on the day before colonoscopy. In addition, patients were instructed to consume nothing by mouth, except clear liquids, from the time the preparation was completed until after the colonoscopy was completed.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing (assessed by the colonoscopists), see Table 2 below. Successful colon cleansing was defined as preparations that were graded excellent (no more than small bits of adherent feces/fluid) or good (small amounts of feces or fluid not interfering with the exam) by the colonoscopist.</p><p>The proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing was similar between treatment groups. No differences in response rates by gender or race were noted in the GaviLyte - H and 5 mg bisacodyl group. In patients ≥ 65 years of age treated with the GaviLyte - H and 5 mg bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP the proportion with successful colon cleansing was 67% (n=28/42)[ 95% CI: ( 50.5, 80.4)].</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Each GaviLyte - H and bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP contains:</p><p>One 5 mg bisacodyl delayed-release tablet, USP: pink, round, enteric coated, debossed “N1” on one side and plain on the other in a blister strip.</p><p>One 2 liter bottle of GaviLyte – H (PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution) powder for reconstitution containing 210 grams of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 2.86 grams of sodium bicarbonate, 5.6 grams of sodium chloride, 0.74 grams of potassium chloride, and 2 gram of flavoring ingredients (if applicable).
