</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Vaccine</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Hibtiter</h2><p>Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate) is an active immunizing agent that is used to prevent infection caused by the <i>Haemophilus influenza</i> type b (Hib) bacteria. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.</p><p>Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine is prepared by adding a diphtheria, meningococcal, or tetanus-related substance to the process. However, this vaccine does <i>not</i> take the place of the regular vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, or meningococcus that children and adults should receive. <i>All of the haemophilus b conjugate vaccines work the same way</i>, but they may be given at different ages or different schedules.</p><p>Infections with <i>Haemophilus influenza</i> type b (Hib) bacteria can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningitis (a brain disease), epiglottitis (a throat disease that can cause suffocation), pericarditis (a heart disease), pneumonia (a lung disease), and septic arthritis (a bone and joint disease). Hib meningitis may cause death or leave the child with serious and permanent damage, such as mental retardation, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness.</p><p>Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine is recommended for all children 2 months to 5 years of age (up to the 6th birthday).</p><p>The <i>Hiberix®</i> vaccine is used as a booster dose for children who have already received the primary series with a haemophilus b conjugate vaccine. The vaccine will "boost" or increase the protection that the child had from an earlier dose.</p><p>This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Hibtiter</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>ActHIB®</i>, <i>HibTITER®</i>, or <i>PedvaxHIB®</i> in children 2 months to 5 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children 6 years of age and older and children younger than 2 months of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of the <i>Hiberix®</i> vaccine in children 15 months to 4 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children 5 years of age and older and children younger than 15 months of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>The haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate) is not for use in adult or geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Guillain-Barré syndrome (severe nerve and muscle problem), history of after a vaccine with tetanus toxoid—Your doctor will decide if you should receive this vaccine.</li>
</ul><ul>
