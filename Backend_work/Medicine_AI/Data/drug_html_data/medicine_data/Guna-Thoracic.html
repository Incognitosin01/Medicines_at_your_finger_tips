WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First">5.1.    Spinal pain requires differential diagnosis for musculoskeletal, neurological, and soft tissue pathologies including but not limited to: disc injuries, herniated disc, and referred pain from organ pathologies and primary or secondary cancer pain. Classification according to muscular pain, radicular nerve pain, skeletal pain, and osteoarticular pain should be made.<br/>
5.2.    Skin cleansing/disinfection is required before application.  Saprophytic bacteria may produce injection site abscesses with improper skin preparation.<br/></p><h2>6. ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">6.1    The most common mild adverse reaction is slight reddening at the injection site due to the mechanical effect of the needle or a superficial skin reaction of mild erythema.<br/></p><h2>7.

<br/></p><h2>9. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</h2><p class="First">9.1.    No Known.</p><h2>10. OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">10.1.    No Known.<br/></p><h2>11. DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">GUNA®-THORACIC is a sterile solution made with isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br/>
It is a homeopathic complex medicine, whose active ingredients have been selected in order to promote 2 main activities:<br/>
•    Detoxification of the connective tissue matrix<br/>
•    Pain modulation through stimulation of the physiological mechanism of pain control.<br/>
•    Attenuation of the biological substrates acts to target the area of activity of the product<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">12.1.    Mechanism of Action<br/>
Due to the homeopathic nature of the active ingredients, receptors may be activated by feedback regulation. Beta-endorphins at the 4C dose activate the membrane receptor for endogen endorphins that play a key role in pain relief. Anti IL-1 induces a download regulation of IL-1 inflammatory activity.<br/>
12.2.    Pharmacodynamics<br/>
The physiological effects of GUNA®-THORACIC are due to the action of the ingredients, as described in the Homeopathic Materia Medica.<br/>
In Homeopathy there is no direct relationship between dose and effect, but rather there is a relationship between attenuation and balancing effect on biochemical pathways.<br/>
In GUNA®-THORACIC the attenuation of each ingredient has been selected according to Arndt-Schulz Principle (inverted effect law). The Attenuation of the physiological ingredients promotes membrane receptor feedback in order to normalize altered biological pathways. In Addition the attenuation technique activates the low dilutions and stabilizes clinical activity of the compound.<br/>
12.3.    Pharmacokinetics<br/>
Homeopathic attenuation provides complete bioavailability of the active ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><p class="First">13.1.    GUNA®-THORACIC has no level of toxicity due to the attenuation of the ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">14.1    GUNA®-THORACIC formulation is based on classical Homeopathy and each ingredient has been selected according to its description in the Homeopathic Materia Medica. The product is intended for application to target points such as acupuncture points, Weihe points, and key neurological points.<br/>
    Clinical indications of the key ingredients:<br/>
Anti interleukin 1 alpha 4C / Anti interleukin 1 beta 4C:<br/>
•    Biological classification:   Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) belongs to the IL-1 family. Endogenous IL-1ra is produced in human autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases.<br/>
•    Etiopathogenesis: Binds to IL-1 receptors in competition with IL-1, but does not elicit intracellular response from this binding. Its key role is counteracting the proinflammatory effects of IL-1.<br/>
•    Space-time localization: next to Arnica.  Reference group: Arnica-Mercurius.<br/>
•    Clinical: Immunological based diseases, autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, acute and chronic pain, osteoarthritis, chronic arthritis, inflammatory psoriasis, wet eczema, localised inflammatory swelling. Appropriate for local application.<br/>
•    Modalities: Worsens with cold and   movement. Improves with rest and warmth.<br/>
•    Association with other cell mediators: TNF 15C / IL8 4C /<br/>
NT4 4C / GCSF 4C.<br/>
Beta-Endorphin 4C:<br/>
•    Biological classification: Neuropeptide  and neurotransmitter. It is produced by the  anterior lobe of the hypophysis  and by the hypothalamus.<br/>
•    Etiopathogenesis: It acts on the mechanism that enhances  pain. It suppresses the memory of painful events and negative experiences.<br/>
•    Space-time localization: next to Arnica.<br/>
 Reference group: Mercurius.<br/>
•    Clinical: Pain management by enhancing the immune response. It acts on modulating pain; supporting cardiac, gastric and vascular function;  and functions in panic disorders and satiation. Organic and functional pain. Remedy for somatization disorders. It enhances acupuncture sessions. Antidepressive activity. It may improve individual positive attitudes.<br/>
•    Modalities: It worsens with fatigue and intensive exercise.<br/>
•    Association with other cell mediators: Sepia / Arnica / Aconitum / Bromum / Aurum / Iodium / IL6 4CH/ Melatonin 15C, 30C, 12LM, 18LM, 30LM / NT4 4C / BDNF 4C.<br/></p><h2>15.
