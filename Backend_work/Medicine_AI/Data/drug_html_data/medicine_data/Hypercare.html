To minimize irritation let the alcohol evaporate (if needed, blow dry with a hair dryer on a cold air setting) leaving an evenly distribution film of the antiperspirant on the skin. Wear a T-shirt while sleeping to prevent the medication from being rubbed off on bed linens. Do not apply Hypercare to broken, irritation or recently shaved skin. Now check instructions under "Next Morning".</p><p><span class="Bold">HYPERHIDROSIS OF PALMS (Hands)</span></p><p>Apply Hypercare evenly to both palms, let the alcohol evaporate, leaving a thin film of antiperspirant on the skin. To keep the medication from being rubbed off during sleep, cover each hand with a sheet of saran wrap, held in place with a mitten or a cotton glove. (Do not use adhesive tape). Now check instructions under "Next Morning".</p><p><span class="Bold">HYPERHIDROSIS OF FEET (Bromhidrosis)</span></p><p>Apply Hypercare evenly to both soles, let the alcohol evaporate, leaving a thin film of antiperspirant on the skin. To keep the medication from being rubbed off during sleep, cover each sole with a sheet of saran wrap, held in place with a sock. (Do not use adhesive tape). Now check the instructions under "Next Morning".</p><p><span class="Bold">HYPERHIDROSIS OF THE SCALP</span></p><p>Apply Hypercare evenly to the scalp. Avoid contact with eyes. Let the alcohol evaporate, leaving a thin film of antiperspirant on the scalp. To keep the medication from being rubbed off during sleep, wear a plastic shower cap. Now check instructions under "Next Morning".</p><p><span class="Bold">NEXT MORNING (Upon Arising)</span></p><p>Depending on the area being treated: Remove the T-shirt, gloves, socks or shower cap. Remove and discard saran wrap. Wash the treated area thoroughly with soap and water or shampoo, to remove the residual antiperspirant and to prevent skin irritation as well as damage to dry clothing, then towel dry the skin or scalp. Do not apply other deodorants or antiperspirants while using Hypercare. Following these procedures, repeat applications of Hypercare for 2 or 3 nights, until the desired ANHIDROSIS (lack of sweating) is achieved. Generally, after that, an application once or twice a week should maintain needed controlled protection from hyperhidrosis. Occasionally, there is some tingling or itching after application. Any irritation it might produce is temporary and will subside if application is avoided for a few days. Hypercare is not absorbed but works locally on outer skin.</p><p>Distributed by<br/>
