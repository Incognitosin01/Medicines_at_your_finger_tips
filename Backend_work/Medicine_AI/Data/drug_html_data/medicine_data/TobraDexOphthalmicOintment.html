</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> TOBRADEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment) is a sterile, multiple dose antibiotic and steroid combination for topical ophthalmic use. The chemical structures for tobramycin and dexamethasone are presented below:</p><p><span class="Bold">Each gram of TOBRADEX (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment) contains: Actives:</span> tobramycin 0.3% (3 mg) and dexamethasone 0.1% (1 mg). <span class="Bold">Preservative:</span> chlorobutanol 0.5%. <span class="Bold">Inactives:</span> mineral oil and white petrolatum.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</span> Corticoids suppress the inflammatory response to a variety of agents and they probably delay or slow healing. Since corticoids may inhibit the body's defense mechanism against infection, a concomitant antimicrobial drug may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant. Dexamethasone is a potent corticoid.</p><p>The antibiotic component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms:</p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococci</span>, including <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> and <span class="Italics">S. epidermidis</span> (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains.</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococci</span>, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, <span class="Italics">Enterobacter aerogenes</span>, <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span>, <span class="Italics">Morganella morganii</span>, most <span class="Italics">Proteus vulgaris</span> strains, <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> and <span class="Italics">H. aegyptius</span>, <span class="Italics">Moraxella lacunata</span>, <span class="Italics">Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</span> and some <span class="Italics">Neisseria</span> species.</p><p>No data are available on the extent of systemic absorption from TOBRADEX (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment); however, it is known that some systemic absorption can occur with ocularly applied drugs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</span> TOBRADEX (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment) is indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists.</p><p>Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies.</p><p>The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye.</p><p>The particular anti-infective drug in this product is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens:</p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococci</span>, including <span class="Italics">S. aureus</span> and <span class="Italics">S. epidermidis</span> (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains.</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococci</span>, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae</span>, <span class="Italics">Enterobacter aerogenes</span>, <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span>, <span class="Italics">Morganella morganii</span>, most <span class="Italics">Proteus vulgaris</span> strains, <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> and <span class="Italics">H. aegyptius</span>, <span class="Italics">Moraxella lacunata</span>, <span class="Italics">Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</span> and some <span class="Italics">Neisseria</span> species.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span></p><p>FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. <span class="Bold">NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE.</span> Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. Severity of hypersensitivity reactions may vary from local effects to generalized reactions such erythema, itching, urticaria, skin rash, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, or bullous reactions. If a sensitivity reaction does occur, discontinue use.</p><p>Prolonged use of steroids may result in glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in pediatric patients and uncooperative patients. Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions and parasitic infections of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after long-term steroid dosing. As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated. When multiple prescriptions are required, or whenever clinical judgement dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.</p><p>Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics may occur; if hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>Ophthalmic ointment may retard corneal wound healing.</p><p>Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial ocular infection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients:</span> Do not touch tube tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Contact lenses should not be worn during the use of this product.</p><p><span class="Bold">Do not use the product if the imprinted carton seals have been damaged, or removed.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> No studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. No impairment of fertility was noted in studies of subcutaneous tobramycin in rats at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span> Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in animal studies. Ocular administration of 0.1% dexamethasone resulted in 15.6% and 32.3% incidence of fetal anomalies in two groups of pregnant rabbits. Fetal growth retardation and increased mortality rates have been observed in rats with chronic dexamethasone therapy. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with tobramycin at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day parenterally and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, prolonged or repeated corticoid use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation. TOBRADEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be observed carefully for signs of hypoadrenalism.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when TOBRADEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment) is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> No overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between the elderly and other adult patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available.</p><p>The most frequent adverse reactions to topical ocular tobramycin TOBREX<span class="Sup">®</span> (tobramycin ophthalmic ointment) 0.3% are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling, and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients.</p><p>The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of intraocular pressure with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Secondary Infection</span>. The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Postmarketing Experience:</span> Additional adverse reactions identified from postmarketing use include, anaphylactic reaction, erythema multiforme.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</span> Apply a small amount (approximately ½ inch ribbon) into the conjunctival sac(s) up to three or four times daily.</p><p>How to apply TOBRADEX<span class="Sup">®</span> (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment):</p><p>1. Tilt your head back.</p><p>2. Place a finger on your cheek just under your eye and gently pull down until a "V" pocket is formed between your eyeball and your lower lid.</p><p>3. Place a small amount (about ½ inch) of TOBRADEX (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment) in the "V" pocket. Do not let the tip of the tube touch your eye.</p><p>4. Look downward before closing your eye.</p><p>Not more than 8 g should be prescribed initially and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in PRECAUTIONS above.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED:</span> 3.5 g STERILE ointment supplied in an aluminum tube with a white polyethylene tip and white polyethylene cap (NDC 0078-0876-01).</p><p><span class="Bold">STORAGE:</span> Store at 2°C to 25°C (36°F to 77°F).</p><p>After opening, TOBRADEX (tobramycin and dexamethasone ophthalmic ointment) can be used until the expiration date on the tube.</p><p>Distributed by:<br/>
