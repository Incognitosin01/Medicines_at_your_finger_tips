Turmeric is also known as Curcuma, Curcumin, Halada, Haldi, Haridra, Indian Saffron, Nisha, Pian Jiang Huang, Rajani, Safran Bourbon, Safran de Batallita, Safran des Indes, Turmeric Root, and Yu Jin. Turmeric should not be confused with Javanese turmeric root (Curcuma zedoaria).</p><p>Turmeric is commonly used to flavor or color curry powders, mustards, and other foods. The turmeric root is also used to make alternative medicine.</p><p>Turmeric has been used in alternative medicine as a possibly effective aid in reducing blood cholesterol, reducing osteoarthritis pain, or relieving itching caused by chronic kidney disease.</p><p>Turmeric has also been used to treat stomach ulcers.
