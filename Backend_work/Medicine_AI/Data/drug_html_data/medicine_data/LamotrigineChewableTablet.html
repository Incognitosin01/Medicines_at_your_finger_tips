</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lamotrigine can cause serious rashes requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of these rashes, which have included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, is approximately 0.3% to 0.8% in pediatric patients (aged 2 to 17 years) and 0.08% to 0.3% in adults receiving lamotrigine. One rash-related death was reported in a prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy taking lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. In worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis and/or rash-related death have been reported in adult and pediatric patients, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Other than age, there are as yet no factors identified that are known to predict the risk of occurrence or the severity of rash caused by lamotrigine. There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of rash may also be increased by (1) coadministration of lamotrigine with valproate (includes valproic acid and divalproex sodium), (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of lamotrigine, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for lamotrigine. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Nearly all cases of life-threatening rashes caused by lamotrigine have occurred within 2 to 8 weeks of treatment initiation. However, isolated cases have occurred after prolonged treatment (e.g., 6 months). Accordingly, duration of therapy cannot be relied upon as means to predict the potential risk heralded by the first appearance of a rash.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Although benign rashes are also caused by lamotrigine, it is not possible to predict reliably which rashes will prove to be serious or life threatening. Accordingly, lamotrigine should ordinarily be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. Discontinuation of treatment may not prevent a rash from becoming life threatening or permanently disabling or disfiguring <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Lamotrigine Chewable Tablet</h2><h3>Epilepsy</h3><p class="First">Lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) are indicated as adjunctive therapy for the following seizure types in patients aged 2 years and older:</p><p class="First">Lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) are indicated for conversion to monotherapy in adults (aged 16 years and older) with partial-onset seizures who are receiving treatment with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate as the single antiepileptic drug (AED).</p><p>Safety and effectiveness of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) have not been established (1) as initial monotherapy; (2) for conversion to monotherapy from AEDs other than carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or valproate; or (3) for simultaneous conversion to monotherapy from 2 or more concomitant AEDs.</p><h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3><p class="First">Lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) are indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes is not recommended. Effectiveness of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) in the acute treatment of mood episodes has not been established.</p><h2>Lamotrigine Chewable Tablet Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Considerations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rash</span></p><p>There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening rash may be increased by (1) coadministration of lamotrigine with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of lamotrigine, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for lamotrigine. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning].</span> Therefore, it is important that the dosing recommendations be followed closely.</p><p>The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs.</p><p>It is recommended that lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) not be restarted in patients who discontinued due to rash associated with prior treatment with lamotrigine unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If the decision is made to restart a patient who has discontinued lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets), the need to restart with the initial dosing recommendations should be assessed. The greater the interval of time since the previous dose, the greater consideration should be given to restarting with the initial dosing recommendations. If a patient has discontinued lamotrigine for a period of more than 5 half-lives, it is recommended that initial dosing recommendations and guidelines be followed. The half-life of lamotrigine is affected by other concomitant medications [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Lamotrigine Tablets For Oral Suspension (Chewable, Dispersible Tablets) Added to Drugs Known to Induce or Inhibit Glucuronidation</span></p><p>Because lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation, drugs that are known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation may affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce glucuronidation include carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir. Valproate inhibits glucuronidation. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) in patients on estrogen-containing contraceptives and atazanavir/ritonavir, see below and Table 13. For dosing considerations for lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) in patients on other drugs known to induce or inhibit glucuronidation, see Tables 1, 2, 5 to 6, and 13.</p><p><span class="Bold">Target Plasma Levels for Patients with Epilepsy or Bipolar Disorder</span></p><p>A therapeutic plasma concentration range has not been established for lamotrigine. Dosing of lamotrigine should be based on therapeutic response <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Starting Lamotrigine Tablets For Oral Suspension (Chewable, Dispersible Tablets) in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:</span> Although estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to increase the clearance of lamotrigine <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>, no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) should be necessary solely based on the use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. Therefore, dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) based on the concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1, 5, and 7). See below for adjustments to maintenance doses of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adjustments to the Maintenance Dose of Lamotrigine Tablets For Oral Suspension (Chewable, Dispersible Tablets) in Women Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">(1) Taking Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:</span> In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)],</span> the maintenance dose of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold over the recommended target maintenance dose to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level.</p><p><span class="Italics">(2) Starting Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:</span> In women taking a stable dose of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) and not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)],</span> the maintenance dose will in most cases need to be increased by as much as 2-fold to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The dose increases should begin at the same time that the oral contraceptive is introduced and continue, based on clinical response, no more rapidly than 50 to 100 mg/day every week. Dose increases should not exceed the recommended rate (see Tables 1 and 5) unless lamotrigine plasma levels or clinical response support larger increases. Gradual transient increases in lamotrigine plasma levels may occur during the week of inactive hormonal preparation (pill-free week), and these increases will be greater if dose increases are made in the days before or during the week of inactive hormonal preparation. Increased lamotrigine plasma levels could result in additional adverse reactions, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia. If adverse reactions attributable to lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) consistently occur during the pill-free week, dose adjustments to the overall maintenance dose may be necessary. Dose adjustments limited to the pill-free week are not recommended. For women taking lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)],</span> no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) should be necessary.</p><p><span class="Italics">(3) Stopping Estrogen-Containing Oral Contraceptives:</span> In women not taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)],</span> the maintenance dose of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) will in most cases need to be decreased by as much as 50% in order to maintain a consistent lamotrigine plasma level. The decrease in dose of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) should not exceed 25% of the total daily dose per week over a 2-week period, unless clinical response or lamotrigine plasma levels indicate otherwise <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> In women taking lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) in addition to carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)],</span> no adjustment to the dose of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) should be necessary.</p><p><span class="Bold">Women and Other Hormonal Contraceptive Preparations or Hormone Replacement Therapy</span></p><p>The effect of other hormonal contraceptive preparations or hormone replacement therapy on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine has not been systematically evaluated. It has been reported that ethinylestradiol, not progestogens, increased the clearance of lamotrigine up to 2-fold, and the progestin-only pills had no effect on lamotrigine plasma levels. Therefore, adjustments to the dosage of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) in the presence of progestogens alone will likely not be needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients Taking Atazanavir/Ritonavir</span></p><p>While atazanavir/ritonavir does reduce the lamotrigine plasma concentration, no adjustments to the recommended dose-escalation guidelines for lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) should be necessary solely based on the use of atazanavir/ritonavir. Dose escalation should follow the recommended guidelines for initiating adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) based on concomitant AED or other concomitant medications (see Tables 1, 2, and 5). In patients already taking maintenance doses of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) and not taking glucuronidation inducers, the dose of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) may need to be increased if atazanavir/ritonavir is added or decreased if atazanavir/ritonavir is discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology(12.3)].</span></p><p class="First">Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. Based on a clinical pharmacology study in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>, the following general recommendations can be made. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild liver impairment. Initial, escalation, and maintenance doses should generally be reduced by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and 50% in patients with severe liver impairment with ascites. Escalation and maintenance doses may be adjusted according to clinical response.</p><p class="First">Initial doses of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) should be based on patients’ concomitant medications (see Tables 1 to 3 and 5); reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets). Because there is inadequate experience in this population, lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) should be used with caution in these patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Epilepsy:</span> For patients receiving lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) in combination with other AEDs, a re-evaluation of all AEDs in the regimen should be considered if a change in seizure control or an appearance or worsening of adverse reactions is observed.</p><p>If a decision is made to discontinue therapy with lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets), a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) is recommended unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation should prolong the half-life of lamotrigine; discontinuing valproate should shorten the half-life of lamotrigine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bipolar Disorder:</span> In the controlled clinical trials, there was no increase in the incidence, type, or severity of adverse reactions following abrupt termination of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets). In the clinical development program in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets). Discontinuation of lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) should involve a step-wise reduction of dose over at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% per week) unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].</span></p><h3>Epilepsy-Adjunctive Therapy</h3><p class="First">This section provides specific dosing recommendations for patients older than 12 years and patients aged 2 to 12 years.

One rash-related death was reported in a prospectively followed cohort of 1,983 pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy taking lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in U.S. and foreign postmarketing experience.</p><p>There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who used valproate concomitantly for epilepsy, 1.2% (6 of 482) experienced a serious rash compared with 0.6% (6 of 952) patients not taking valproate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adult Population</span></p><p>Serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of lamotrigine occurred in 0.3% (11 of 3,348) of adult patients who received lamotrigine in premarketing clinical trials of epilepsy. In the bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials, the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1,233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1,538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy. No fatalities occurred among these individuals. However, in worldwide postmarketing experience, rare cases of rash-related death have been reported, but their numbers are too few to permit a precise estimate of the rate.</p><p>Among the rashes leading to hospitalization were Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, and those associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p>There is evidence that the inclusion of valproate in a multidrug regimen increases the risk of serious, potentially life-threatening rash in adults. Specifically, of 584 patients administered lamotrigine with valproate in epilepsy clinical trials, 6 (1%) were hospitalized in association with rash; in contrast, 4 (0.16%) of 2,398 clinical trial patients and volunteers administered lamotrigine in the absence of valproate were hospitalized.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with History of Allergy or Rash to Other Antiepileptic Drugs</span></p><p>The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation for lamotrigine is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs.</p><h3>Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis</h3><p class="First">Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has occurred in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Common findings include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver function and coagulation abnormalities. In cases of HLH reported with lamotrigine, patients have presented with signs of systemic inflammation (fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and organ system dysfunction) and blood dyscrasias. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 8 to 24 days following the initiation of treatment. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><h3>Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure</h3><p class="First">Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have occurred with lamotrigine. Some have been fatal or life threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.</p><p>Fatalities associated with acute multiorgan failure and various degrees of hepatic failure have been reported in 2 of 3,796 adult patients and 4 of 2,435 pediatric patients who received lamotrigine in epilepsy clinical trials. Rare fatalities from multiorgan failure have also been reported in postmarketing use.</p><p>Isolated liver failure without rash or involvement of other organs has also been reported with lamotrigine.</p><p>It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though a rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lamotrigine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><p>Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine, the patient should be instructed that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a healthcare provider immediately.</p><h3>Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">In vitro testing</span> showed that lamotrigine exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Based on this activity, lamotrigine could slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) and induce proarrhythmia, including sudden death, in patients with structural heart disease or myocardial ischemia. Therefore, avoid the use of lamotrigine in patients who have cardiac conduction disorders (e.g., second- or third-degree heart block), ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac disease or abnormality (e.g., myocardial ischemia, heart failure, structural heart disease, Brugada syndrome or other sodium channelopathies). Concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers may increase the risk of proarrhythmia.</p><h3>Blood Dyscrasias</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of blood dyscrasias that may or may not be associated with multiorgan hypersensitivity (also known as DRESS) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>. These have included neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and, rarely, aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia.</p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">AEDs, including lamotrigine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p><p>Table 7 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Indication</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Relative Risk:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Difference:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients</span></p><p class="First">Epilepsy</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">3.4</p><p class="First">3.5</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">Psychiatric</p><p class="First">5.7</p><p class="First">8.5</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">2.9</p><p class="First">Other</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">Total</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">4.3</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing lamotrigine or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, the emergence of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><h3>Aseptic Meningitis</h3><p class="First">Therapy with lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. Because of the potential for serious outcomes of untreated meningitis due to other causes, patients should also be evaluated for other causes of meningitis and treated as appropriate.</p><p>Postmarketing cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported in pediatric and adult patients taking lamotrigine for various indications. Symptoms upon presentation have included headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity. Rash, photophobia, myalgia, chills, altered consciousness, and somnolence were also noted in some cases. Symptoms have been reported to occur within 1 day to one and a half months following the initiation of treatment. In most cases, symptoms were reported to resolve after discontinuation of lamotrigine. Re-exposure resulted in a rapid return of symptoms (from within 30 minutes to 1 day following re-initiation of treatment) that were frequently more severe. Some of the patients treated with lamotrigine who developed aseptic meningitis had underlying diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyzed at the time of clinical presentation in reported cases was characterized by a mild to moderate pleocytosis, normal glucose levels, and mild to moderate increase in protein. CSF white blood cell count differentials showed a predominance of neutrophils in a majority of the cases, although a predominance of lymphocytes was reported in approximately one third of the cases. Some patients also had new onset of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs (predominantly hepatic and renal involvement), which may suggest that in these cases the aseptic meningitis observed was part of a hypersensitivity reaction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Potential Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Medication errors involving lamotrigine have occurred. In particular, the name lamotrigine can be confused with the names of other commonly used medications. Medication errors may also occur between the different formulations of lamotrigine. To reduce the potential of medication errors, write and say lamotrigine clearly. Depictions of the lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) can be found in the Medication Guide that accompanies the product to highlight the distinctive markings, colors, and shapes that serve to identify the different presentations of the drug and thus may help reduce the risk of medication errors. To avoid the medication error of using the wrong drug or formulation, patients should be strongly advised to visually inspect their tablets to verify that they are lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets), as well as the correct formulation of lamotrigine, each time they fill their prescription.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Some estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been shown to decrease serum concentrations of lamotrigine <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Dosage adjustments will be necessary in most patients who start or stop estrogen-containing oral contraceptives while taking lamotrigine <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. During the week of inactive hormone preparation (pill-free week) of oral contraceptive therapy, plasma lamotrigine levels are expected to rise, as much as doubling at the end of the week. Adverse reactions consistent with elevated levels of lamotrigine, such as dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia, could occur.</p><h3>Withdrawal Seizures</h3><p class="First">As with other AEDs, lamotrigine should not be abruptly discontinued. In patients with epilepsy there is a possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In clinical trials in adults with bipolar disorder, 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine. Unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal, the dose of lamotrigine should be tapered over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% reduction per week) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Status Epilepticus</h3><p class="First">Valid estimates of the incidence of treatment-emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with lamotrigine are difficult to obtain because reporters participating in clinical trials did not all employ identical rules for identifying cases. At a minimum, 7 of 2,343 adult patients had episodes that could unequivocally be described as status epilepticus. In addition, a number of reports of variably defined episodes of seizure exacerbation (e.g., seizure clusters, seizure flurries) were made.</p><h3>Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP)</h3><p class="First">During the premarketing development of lamotrigine, 20 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 4,700 patients with epilepsy (5,747 patient-years of exposure).</p><p>Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0035 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients not receiving lamotrigine (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of patients with epilepsy, to 0.004 for a recently studied clinical trial population similar to that in the clinical development program for lamotrigine, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or suggest concern depends on the comparability of the populations reported upon with the cohort receiving lamotrigine and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Probably most reassuring is the similarity of estimated SUDEP rates in patients receiving lamotrigine and those receiving other AEDs, chemically unrelated to each other, that underwent clinical testing in similar populations. This evidence suggests, although it certainly does not prove, that the high SUDEP rates reflect population rates, not a drug effect.</p><h3>Addition of Lamotrigine to a Multidrug Regimen that Includes Valproate</h3><p class="First">Because valproate reduces the clearance of lamotrigine, the dosage of lamotrigine in the presence of valproate is less than half of that required in its absence <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Binding in the Eye and Other Melanin-Containing Tissues</h3><p class="First">Because lamotrigine binds to melanin, it could accumulate in melanin-rich tissues over time. This raises the possibility that lamotrigine may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Although ophthalmological testing was performed in 1 controlled clinical trial, the testing was inadequate to exclude subtle effects or injury occurring after long-term exposure. Moreover, the capacity of available tests to detect potentially adverse consequences, if any, of lamotrigine's binding to melanin is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p>Accordingly, although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmological monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">False-Positive Drug Test Results</span></p><p>Lamotrigine has been reported to interfere with the assay used in some rapid urine drug screens, which can result in false-positive readings, particularly for phencyclidine (PCP). A more specific analytical method should be used to confirm a positive result.</p><p><span class="Bold">Plasma Concentrations of Lamotrigine</span></p><p>The value of monitoring plasma concentrations of lamotrigine in patients treated with lamotrigine has not been established. Because of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions between lamotrigine and other drugs, including AEDs (see Table 13), monitoring of the plasma levels of lamotrigine and concomitant drugs may be indicated, particularly during dosage adjustments. In general, clinical judgment should be exercised regarding monitoring of plasma levels of lamotrigine and other drugs and whether or not dosage adjustments are necessary.</p><h3>Risk in Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Phenylalanine is a component of aspartame. Lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets), 5 mg and 25 mg, each contain 1.123 mg phenylalanine.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described in more detail in the <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> section of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Most Common Adverse Reactions in All Clinical Trials: Adjunctive Therapy in Adults with Epilepsy:</span> The most commonly observed (≥5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with lamotrigine during adjunctive therapy in adults and not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients were: dizziness, ataxia, somnolence, headache, diplopia, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, and rash. Dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting were dose related. Dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, and blurred vision occurred more commonly in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine. Clinical data suggest a higher incidence of rash, including serious rash, in patients receiving concomitant valproate than in patients not receiving valproate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p>Approximately 11% of the 3,378 adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction.

Encourage women who are taking lamotrigine during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or visiting http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Data from several prospective pregnancy exposure registries and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of major congenital malformations or a consistent pattern of malformations among women exposed to lamotrigine compared with the general population <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. The majority of lamotrigine pregnancy exposure data are from women with epilepsy. In animal studies, administration of lamotrigine during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (increased mortality, decreased body weight, increased structural variation, neurobehavioral abnormalities) at doses lower than those administered clinically.</p><p>Lamotrigine decreased fetal folate concentrations in rats, an effect known to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in animals and humans <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>As with other AEDs, physiological changes during pregnancy may affect lamotrigine concentrations and/or therapeutic effect. There have been reports of decreased lamotrigine concentrations during pregnancy and restoration of pre-pregnancy concentrations after delivery. Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain clinical response.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data:</span> Data from several international pregnancy registries have not shown an increased risk for malformations overall. The International Lamotrigine Pregnancy Registry reported major congenital malformations in 2.2% (95% CI: 1.6%, 3.1%) of 1,558 infants exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester of pregnancy. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry reported major congenital malformations among 2.0% of 1,562 infants exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester. EURAP, a large international pregnancy registry focused outside of North America, reported major birth defects in 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3%, 3.7%) of 2,514 exposures to lamotrigine monotherapy in the first trimester. The frequency of major congenital malformations was similar to estimates from the general population.</p><p>The NAAED Pregnancy Registry observed an increased risk of isolated oral clefts: among 2,200 infants exposed to lamotrigine early in pregnancy, the risk of oral clefts was 3.2 per 1,000 (95% CI: 1.4, 6.3), a 3-fold increased risk versus unexposed healthy controls. This finding has not been observed in other large international pregnancy registries. Furthermore, a case-control study based on 21 congenital anomaly registries covering over 10 million births in Europe reported an adjusted odds ratio for isolated oral clefts with lamotrigine exposure of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.63).</p><p>Several meta-analyses have not reported an increased risk of major congenital malformations following lamotrigine exposure in pregnancy compared with healthy and disease-matched controls. No patterns of specific malformation types were observed.</p><p>The same meta-analyses evaluated the risk of additional maternal and infant outcomes including fetal death, stillbirth, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and neurodevelopmental delay. Although there are no data suggesting an increased risk of these outcomes with lamotrigine monotherapy exposure, differences in outcome definition, ascertainment methods, and comparator groups limit the conclusions that can be drawn.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> When lamotrigine was administered to pregnant mice, rats, or rabbits during the period of organogenesis (oral doses of up to 125, 25, and 30 mg/kg, respectively), reduced fetal body weight and increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen in mice and rats at doses that were also maternally toxic. The no-effect doses for embryofetal developmental toxicity in mice, rats, and rabbits (75, 6.25, and 30 mg/kg, respectively) are similar to (mice and rabbits) or less than (rats) the human dose of 400 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis.</p><p>In a study in which pregnant rats were administered lamotrigine (oral doses of 0, 5, or 25 mg/kg) during the period of organogenesis and offspring were evaluated postnatally, neurobehavioral abnormalities were observed in exposed offspring at both doses.

Neonates and young infants are at risk for high serum levels because maternal serum and milk levels can rise to high levels postpartum if lamotrigine dosage has been increased during pregnancy but is not reduced after delivery to the pre-pregnancy dosage. Glucuronidation is required for drug clearance. Glucuronidation capacity is immature in the infant and this may also contribute to the level of lamotrigine exposure. Events including rash, apnea, drowsiness, poor sucking, and poor weight gain (requiring hospitalization in some cases) have been reported in infants who have been human milk-fed by mothers using lamotrigine; whether or not these events were caused by lamotrigine is unknown. No data are available on the effects of the drug on milk production.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for lamotrigine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from lamotrigine or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Human milk-fed infants should be closely monitored for adverse events resulting from lamotrigine. Measurement of infant serum levels should be performed to rule out toxicity if concerns arise. Human milk-feeding should be discontinued in infants with lamotrigine toxicity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Data from multiple small studies indicate that lamotrigine plasma levels in nursing infants have been reported to be as high as 50% of maternal plasma concentrations.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Epilepsy</span></p><p>Lamotrigine is indicated as adjunctive therapy in patients aged 2 years and older for partial-onset seizures, the generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and PGTC seizures.</p><p>Safety and efficacy of lamotrigine used as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures were not demonstrated in a small, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal trial in very young pediatric patients (aged 1 to 24 months). Lamotrigine was associated with an increased risk for infectious adverse reactions (lamotrigine 37%, placebo 5%), and respiratory adverse reactions (lamotrigine 26%, placebo 5%). Infectious adverse reactions included bronchiolitis, bronchitis, ear infection, eye infection, otitis externa, pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and viral infection. Respiratory adverse reactions included nasal congestion, cough, and apnea.</p><p><span class="Bold">Bipolar Disorder</span></p><p>Safety and efficacy of lamotrigine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder were not established in a double-blind, randomized withdrawal, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated 301 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with a current manic/hypomanic, depressed, or mixed mood episode as defined by DSM-IV-TR. In the randomized phase of the trial, adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients taking lamotrigine (n = 87) and were twice as common compared with patients taking placebo (n = 86) were influenza (lamotrigine 8%, placebo 2%), oropharyngeal pain (lamotrigine 8%, placebo 2%), vomiting (lamotrigine 6%, placebo 2%), contact dermatitis (lamotrigine 5%, placebo 2%), upper abdominal pain (lamotrigine 5%, placebo 1%), and suicidal ideation (lamotrigine 5%, placebo 0%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Data</span></p><p>In a juvenile animal study in which lamotrigine (oral doses of 0, 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg) was administered to young rats from postnatal day 7 to 62, decreased viability and growth were seen at the highest dose tested and long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities (decreased locomotor activity, increased reactivity, and learning deficits in animals tested as adults) were observed at the 2 highest doses. The no-effect dose for adverse developmental effects in juvenile animals is less than the human dose of 400 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of lamotrigine for epilepsy and bipolar disorder did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients or exhibit a different safety profile than that of younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Experience in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. Based on a clinical pharmacology study in 24 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe liver impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>, the following general recommendations can be made. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild liver impairment. Initial, escalation, and maintenance doses should generally be reduced by approximately 25% in patients with moderate and severe liver impairment without ascites and 50% in patients with severe liver impairment with ascites. Escalation and maintenance doses may be adjusted according to clinical response <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Lamotrigine is metabolized mainly by glucuronic acid conjugation, with the majority of the metabolites being recovered in the urine. In a small study comparing a single dose of lamotrigine in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment with healthy volunteers, the plasma half-life of lamotrigine was approximately twice as long in the subjects with chronic renal failure <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Initial doses of lamotrigine should be based on patients’ AED regimens; reduced maintenance doses may be effective for patients with significant renal impairment. Few patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with lamotrigine. Because there is inadequate experience in this population, lamotrigine should be used with caution in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Human Overdose Experience</h3><p class="First">Overdoses involving quantities up to 15 g have been reported for lamotrigine, some of which have been fatal. Overdose has resulted in ataxia, nystagmus, seizures (including tonic-clonic seizures), decreased level of consciousness, coma, and intraventricular conduction delay.</p><h3>Management of Overdose</h3><p class="First">There are no specific antidotes for lamotrigine. Following a suspected overdose, hospitalization of the patient is advised. General supportive care is indicated, including frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient. If indicated, emesis should be induced; usual precautions should be taken to protect the airway. It should be kept in mind that immediate-release lamotrigine is rapidly absorbed <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. It is uncertain whether hemodialysis is an effective means of removing lamotrigine from the blood. In 6 renal failure patients, about 20% of the amount of lamotrigine in the body was removed by hemodialysis during a 4-hour session. A Poison Control Center should be contacted for information on the management of overdosage of lamotrigine.</p><h2>Lamotrigine Chewable Tablet Description</h2><p class="First">Lamotrigine, USP, an AED of the phenyltriazine class, is chemically unrelated to existing AEDs. Lamotrigine’s chemical name is 3,5-diamino-6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-<span class="Italics">as</span>-triazine, its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">9</span>H<span class="Sub">7</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>Cl<span class="Sub">2</span>, and its molecular weight is 256.09 g/mol.

The structural formula is:</p><p>Lamotrigine Tablets for oral suspension (Chewable, Dispersible Tablets), 5 mg and 25 mg are supplied for oral administration. The tablets contain 5 mg (white to off-white) or 25 mg (white to off-white) of lamotrigine, USP and the following inactive ingredients: aspartame, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone K-25, sodium starch glycolate and strawberry guarana 586997 AP 0551.</p><h2>Lamotrigine Chewable Tablet - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism(s) by which lamotrigine exerts its anticonvulsant action are unknown. In animal models designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, lamotrigine was effective in preventing seizure spread in the maximum electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (scMet) tests, and prevented seizures in the visually and electrically evoked after-discharge (EEAD) tests for antiepileptic activity. Lamotrigine also displayed inhibitory properties in the kindling model in rats both during kindling development and in the fully kindled state. The relevance of these models to human epilepsy, however, is not known.</p><p>One proposed mechanism of action of lamotrigine, the relevance of which remains to be established in humans, involves an effect on sodium channels. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> pharmacological studies suggest that lamotrigine inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and consequently modulating presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids (e.g., glutamate and aspartate).</p><p class="First">Lamotrigine did not inhibit N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced depolarizations in rat cortical slices or NMDA-induced cyclic GMP formation in immature rat cerebellum, nor did lamotrigine displace compounds that are either competitive or noncompetitive ligands at this glutamate receptor complex (CNQX, CGS, TCHP). The IC<span class="Sub">50</span> for lamotrigine effects on NMDA-induced currents (in the presence of 3 mcM of glycine) in cultured hippocampal neurons exceeded 100 mcM.</p><p>The mechanisms by which lamotrigine exerts its therapeutic action in bipolar disorder have not been established.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Folate Metabolism</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, lamotrigine inhibited dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. Inhibition of this enzyme may interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. When oral daily doses of lamotrigine were given to pregnant rats during organogenesis, fetal, placental, and maternal folate concentrations were reduced. Significantly reduced concentrations of folate are associated with teratogenesis <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>. Folate concentrations were also reduced in male rats given repeated oral doses of lamotrigine. Reduced concentrations were partially returned to normal when supplemented with folinic acid.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Lamotrigine:</span> In vitro studies show that lamotrigine exhibits Class IB antiarrhythmic activity at therapeutically relevant concentrations. It inhibits human cardiac sodium channels with rapid onset and offset kinetics and strong voltage dependence, consistent with other Class IB antiarrhythmic agents. Lamotrigine did not slow ventricular conduction (widen QRS) in healthy individuals in a thorough QT study; however, it could slow ventricular conduction and increase the risk of arrhythmia in patients with structural heart disease or myocardial ischemia. Elevated heart rates could also increase the risk of ventricular conduction slowing with lamotrigine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Lamotrigine Metabolite:</span> In dogs, lamotrigine is extensively metabolized to a 2-Nmethyl metabolite. This metabolite causes dose-dependent prolongation of the PR interval, widening of the QRS complex, and, at higher doses, complete AV conduction block. The in vitro electrophysiological effects of this metabolite have not been studied. Similar cardiovascular effects from this metabolite are not anticipated in humans because only trace amounts of the 2-N-methyl metabolite (&lt;0.6% of lamotrigine dose) have been found in human urine <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. However, it is conceivable that plasma concentrations of this metabolite could be increased in patients with a reduced capacity to glucuronidate lamotrigine (e.g., in patients with liver disease, patients taking concomitant medications that inhibit glucuronidation).</p><p><span class="Bold">Accumulation in Kidneys</span></p><p>Lamotrigine accumulated in the kidney of the male rat, causing chronic progressive nephrosis, necrosis, and mineralization. These findings are attributed to α-2 microglobulin, a species- and sex-specific protein that has not been detected in humans or other animal species.</p><p><span class="Bold">Melanin Binding</span></p><p>Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues, e.g., in the eye and pigmented skin.

The bioavailability is not affected by food. Peak plasma concentrations occur anywhere from 1.4 to 4.8 hours following drug administration. The lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets) were found to be equivalent, whether administered as dispersed in water, chewed and swallowed, or swallowed whole, to the lamotrigine compressed tablets in terms of rate and extent of absorption. In terms of rate and extent of absorption, lamotrigine orally disintegrating tablets, whether disintegrated in the mouth or swallowed whole with water, were equivalent to the lamotrigine compressed tablets swallowed with water.</p><p class="First">In healthy volunteers not receiving any other medications and given single doses, the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine increased in direct proportion to the dose administered over the range of 50 to 400 mg. In 2 small studies (n = 7 and 8) of patients with epilepsy who were maintained on other AEDs, there also was a linear relationship between dose and lamotrigine plasma concentrations at steady state following doses of 50 to 350 mg twice daily.</p><p class="First">Estimates of the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of lamotrigine following oral administration ranged from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. Vd/F is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers.</p><p class="First">Data from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies indicate that lamotrigine is approximately 55% bound to human plasma proteins at plasma lamotrigine concentrations from 1 to 10 mcg/mL (10 mcg/mL is 4 to 6 times the trough plasma concentration observed in the controlled efficacy trials). Because lamotrigine is not highly bound to plasma proteins, clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are unlikely. The binding of lamotrigine to plasma proteins did not change in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate. Lamotrigine did not displace other AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) from protein-binding sites.</p><p class="First">Lamotrigine is metabolized predominantly by glucuronic acid conjugation; the major metabolite is an inactive 2-N-glucuronide conjugate.

Patients were randomized to receive placebo, a target dose of 300 mg/day of lamotrigine, or a target dose of 500 mg/day of lamotrigine. The median reductions in the frequency of all partial-onset seizures relative to baseline were 8% in patients receiving placebo, 20% in patients receiving 300 mg/day of lamotrigine, and 36% in patients receiving 500 mg/day of lamotrigine. The seizure frequency reduction was statistically significant in the 500-mg/day group compared with the placebo group, but not in the 300-mg/day group.</p><p>A second trial (n = 98) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial consisting of two 14-week treatment periods (the last 2 weeks of which consisted of dose tapering) separated by a 4-week washout period. Patients could not be on more than 2 other anticonvulsants and valproate was not allowed. The target dose of lamotrigine was 400 mg/day. When the first 12 weeks of the treatment periods were analyzed, the median change in seizure frequency was a 25% reduction on lamotrigine compared with placebo (<span class="Italics">P</span>&lt;0.001).</p><p>The third trial (n = 41) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial consisting of two 12-week treatment periods separated by a 4-week washout period. Patients could not be on more than 2 other anticonvulsants. Thirteen patients were on concomitant valproate; these patients received 150 mg/day of lamotrigine. The 28 other patients had a target dose of 300 mg/day of lamotrigine. The median change in seizure frequency was a 26% reduction on lamotrigine compared with placebo (<span class="Italics">P</span>&lt;0.01).</p><p>No differences in efficacy based on age, sex, or race, as measured by change in seizure frequency, were detected.</p><p class="First">The effectiveness of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures was established in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 199 patients aged 2 to 16 years (n = 98 on lamotrigine, n = 101 on placebo). Following an 8-week baseline phase, patients were randomized to 18 weeks of treatment with lamotrigine or placebo added to their current AED regimen of up to 2 drugs. Patients were dosed based on body weight and valproate use. Target doses were designed to approximate 5 mg/kg/day for patients taking valproate (maximum dose: 250 mg/day) and 15 mg/kg/day for the patients not taking valproate (maximum dose: 750 mg/day). The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in all partial-onset seizures. For the intent-to-treat population, the median reduction of all partial-onset seizures was 36% in patients treated with lamotrigine and 7% on placebo, a difference that was statistically significant (<span class="Italics">P</span>&lt;0.01).</p><p class="First">The effectiveness of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome was established in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 169 patients aged 3 to 25 years (n = 79 on lamotrigine, n = 90 on placebo). Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo phase, patients were randomized to 16 weeks of treatment with lamotrigine or placebo added to their current AED regimen of up to 3 drugs. Patients were dosed on a fixed-dose regimen based on body weight and valproate use. Target doses were designed to approximate 5 mg/kg/day for patients taking valproate (maximum dose: 200 mg/day) and 15 mg/kg/day for patients not taking valproate (maximum dose: 400 mg/day). The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in major motor seizures (atonic, tonic, major myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures). For the intent-to-treat population, the median reduction of major motor seizures was 32% in patients treated with lamotrigine and 9% on placebo, a difference that was statistically significant (<span class="Italics">P</span>&lt;0.05). Drop attacks were significantly reduced by lamotrigine (34%) compared with placebo (9%), as were tonic-clonic seizures (36% reduction versus 10% increase for lamotrigine and placebo, respectively).</p><p class="First">The effectiveness of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in patients with PGTC seizures was established in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 117 pediatric and adult patients aged 2 years and older (n = 58 on lamotrigine, n = 59 on placebo). Patients with at least 3 PGTC seizures during an 8-week baseline phase were randomized to 19 to 24 weeks of treatment with lamotrigine or placebo added to their current AED regimen of up to 2 drugs. Patients were dosed on a fixed-dose regimen, with target doses ranging from 3 to 12 mg/kg/day for pediatric patients and from 200 to 400 mg/day for adult patients based on concomitant AEDs.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage change from baseline in PGTC seizures. For the intent-to-treat population, the median percent reduction in PGTC seizures was 66% in patients treated with lamotrigine and 34% on placebo, a difference that was statistically significant (<span class="Italics">P</span> = 0.006).</p><h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The effectiveness of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. Trial 1 enrolled patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV and Trial 2 included patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) episode of mania or hypomania as defined by DSM-IV. Both trials included a cohort of patients (30% of 404 subjects in Trial 1 and 28% of 171 patients in Trial 2) with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (4 to 6 episodes per year).</p><p>In both trials, patients were titrated to a target dose of 200 mg of lamotrigine, as add-on therapy or as monotherapy with gradual withdrawal of any psychotropic medications during an 8- to 16-week open-label period. Overall 81% of 1,305 patients participating in the open-label period were receiving 1 or more other psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics (including olanzapine), valproate, or lithium, during titration of lamotrigine. Patients with a CGI-severity score of 3 or less maintained for at least 4 continuous weeks, including at least the final week on monotherapy with lamotrigine, were randomized to a placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period for up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was TIME (time to intervention for a mood episode or one that was emerging, time to discontinuation for either an adverse event that was judged to be related to bipolar disorder, or for lack of efficacy). The mood episode could be depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed episode.</p><p>In Trial 1, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine 50 mg/day (n = 50), lamotrigine 200 mg/day (n = 124), lamotrigine 400 mg/day (n = 47), or placebo (n = 121). Lamotrigine (200- and 400-mg/day treatment groups combined) was superior to placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 1). Separate analyses of the 200- and 400-mg/day dose groups revealed no added benefit from the higher dose.</p><p>In Trial 2, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day, n = 59), or placebo (n = 70). Lamotrigine was superior to placebo in delaying time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 2). The mean dose of lamotrigine was about 211 mg/day.</p><p>Although these trials were not designed to separately evaluate time to the occurrence of depression or mania, a combined analysis for the 2 trials revealed a statistically significant benefit for lamotrigine over placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of both depression and mania, although the finding was more robust for depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier Estimation of Cumulative Proportion of Patients with Mood Episode (Trial 1)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Estimation of Cumulative Proportion of Patients with Mood Episode (Trial 2)</span></p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lamotrigine Tablets for oral suspension (Chewable, Dispersible Tablets), 5 mg:</span> White to off-white, caplet shaped, flat faced beveled edged, uncoated tablets with a score line on one side and “228” debossed on the other side.</p><p>Bottles of 90 (NDC 68462-228-90)</p><p>Bottles of 100 (NDC 68462-228-01)</p><p>Bottles of 1000 (NDC 68462-228-10)</p><p><span class="Bold">Lamotrigine Tablets for oral suspension (Chewable, Dispersible Tablets), 25 mg:</span> White to off-white, circular, flat faced beveled edged, uncoated tablets with ‘G’ debossed on one side and ‘229’ debossed on the other side.</p><p>Bottles of 90 (NDC 68462-229-90)</p><p>Bottles of 100 (NDC 68462-229-01)</p><p>Bottles of 1000 (NDC 68462-229-10)</p><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature] in a dry place.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).</p><p><span class="Bold">Rash</span></p><p>Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets), inform patients that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and instruct them to report any such occurrence to their healthcare providers immediately.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis</span></p><p>Prior to initiation of treatment with lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets), inform patients that excessive immune activation may occur with lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets), and that they should report signs or symptoms such as fever, rash, or lymphadenopathy to a healthcare provider immediately.</p><p><span class="Bold">Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions, Blood Dyscrasias, and Organ Failure</span></p><p>Inform patients that multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions and acute multiorgan failure may occur with lamotrigine tablets for oral suspension (chewable, dispersible tablets).
