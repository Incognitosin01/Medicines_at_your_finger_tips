The recommended dose is 0.04 mcg per kg IV over a 30- to 60-second interval.  If satisfactory transit of the barium meal has not occurred in 30 minutes, a second dose may be administered.<br/> <br/>To reduce intestinal side effects, a 30-minute IV infusion 0.12 mcg per kg diluted to approximately 100 mL with sodium chloride may be administered.<br/><br/></p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Pancreatic Secretion:</b></p><p>To test pancreatic function: 0.25 units per kg IV over a 60-mlnute period.  <br/> <br/>Thirty minutes after the initiation of the infusion, a separate IV infusion at a total dose of 0.02 mcg per kg is administered over a 30-minute interval (for example, the total dose for a 70 kg patient is 1.4 mcg of sincalide; therefore, dilute 1.4 mL of reconstituted solution to 30 mL with sodium chloride Injection and administer at a rate of 1 mL per minute).</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Gallbladder Contraction:</b></p><p>Initial dose: IV: 0.02 mcg/kg over 30 to 60 minutes<br/><br/>If satisfactory contraction of the gallbladder does not occur in 15 minutes, a second dose, 0.04 mcg/kg IV may be administered.<br/><br/>To reduce intestinal side effects, an intravenous infusion may be prepared at a dose of 0.12 mcg/kg in 100 mL of sodium chloride Injection and given at a rate of 2 mL per minute.  Alternatively, an intramuscular dose of 0.1 mcg/kg may be given.  <br/> <br/>When sincalide is used in cholecystography, roentgenograms are usually taken at five-minute Intervals after the injection.  For visualization of the cystic duct, it may be necessary to take roentgenograms at one-minute intervals during the first five minutes after the injection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">What other drugs will affect sincalide?</h2><p>Other drugs may affect sincalide, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.
