Gently invert several times. Solution should be particle free and colorless to slightly brownish-yellow.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM: Administer IM, preferably in the deltoid muscle. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection. To prevent syncope-related injuries, patients should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, and the administering person's name, title, and address be entered into the patient's permanent medical record.</p><p>For patients at risk of hemorrhage following IM injection, the vaccine should be administered IM if, in the opinion of the physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23-gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store frozen at -80°C to -60°C (-112°F to -76°F). Protect from light. Thaw the vial at room temperature (not in the refrigerator) until no visible ice is present. Use immediately after thawing or store thawed vial refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (35.6°F to 46.4°F) for up to 2 weeks or at room temperature (up to 25°C [77°F]) for up to 4 hours. Protect from light. Do not refreeze thawed vaccine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Atoltivimab, Maftivimab, and Odesivimab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Live).

Management: If a parenteral live vaccine has been recently administered, do administer a scheduled PPD skin test for at least 4-6 weeks following administration of the vaccine. Simultaneous administration of a parenteral live vaccine and PPD skin test is acceptable.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Vaccines (Live): May diminish the therapeutic effect of other Vaccines (Live). Management: Two or more injectable or nasally administered live vaccines not administered on the same day should be separated by at least 28 days (ie, 4 weeks). If not, the vaccine administered second should be repeated at least 4 week later.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Venetoclax: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vaccines (Live). Venetoclax may diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Live). Management: Avoid use of live, attenuated vaccines before, during, or after (prior to B-cell recovery) venetoclax treatment.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Lymphocytopenia, neutropenia</p><p>Local: Erythema at injection site (2% to 12%), pain at injection site (34% to 70%; severe: 3%), swelling at injection site (2% to 17%)</p><p>Nervous system: Fatigue (19%), headache (37%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Arthralgia (7% to 18% [placebo: 3% to 6%]; severe:1%), myalgia (33%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (34%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Skin rash (4%), vesicular eruption (2%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Nausea (8%)</p><p>Nervous system: Chills (7%), paresthesia (1%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Arthritis (5% [placebo: 0%]; severe: &lt;1%)</p><p>&lt;1%: Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available during vaccine use (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration: Vaccine administration that is too high on the upper arm may cause shoulder injury (eg, shoulder bursitis or tendinopathy) resulting in shoulder pain and reduced range of motion following injection. Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).</p><p>• Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues: </b></i></p><p>• Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP generally recommends simultaneous administration (ie, &gt;1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Altered immunocompetence: Live vaccines should be administered ≥4 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression and avoided within 2 weeks of immunosuppression when feasible; live vaccines should not be administered for ≥3 months after immunosuppressive therapy (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]).</p><p>• Transmission of virus: Transmission of vaccine virus is a theoretical risk; vaccine virus RNA was present in blood, saliva, urine, and fluid from skin vesicles of vaccinated adults for at least ≥14 days after vaccination.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>There is limited information related to pregnancy outcomes in women who became pregnant following vaccination with an Ebola virus vaccine (Juan-Giner 2019). In general, vaccination with live, attenuated virus vaccines is contraindicated during pregnancy (ACIP [Ezeanolue 2020]). A decision to vaccinate a woman who is pregnant should consider the woman's risk of exposure to Zaire ebolavirus. It is not known if virus from this vaccine can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus.</p><p>Ebola infection is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and maternal death (Haddad 2018). Women with Ebola virus infection can transmit the virus during childbirth (WHO 2018).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent disease caused by Ebola virus.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
