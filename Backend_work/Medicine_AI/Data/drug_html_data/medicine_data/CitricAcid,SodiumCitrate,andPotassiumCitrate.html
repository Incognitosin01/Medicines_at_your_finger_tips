Dilute with water prior to administration. Chilling solution prior to dosing helps to enhance palatability. May follow dose with additional fluids.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Should be taken after meals to avoid GI upset or laxative effect.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at controlled room temperature of 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); do not freeze. Protect from excessive heat.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aliskiren: Potassium Salts may enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Aliskiren. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Alpha-/Beta-Agonists (Indirect-Acting): Alkalinizing Agents may increase the serum concentration of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists (Indirect-Acting). <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Aluminum Hydroxide: Citric Acid Derivatives may increase the absorption of Aluminum Hydroxide. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Amantadine: Alkalinizing Agents may increase the serum concentration of Amantadine. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Amphetamines: Alkalinizing Agents may decrease the excretion of Amphetamines.  Management: Consider alternatives to using amphetamines and alkalinizing agents in combination. If these agents must be used together, patients should be monitored closely for excessive amphetamine effects.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers: Potassium Salts may enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: Potassium Salts may enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Anticholinergic Agents: May enhance the ulcerogenic effect of Potassium Citrate.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Drospirenone: Potassium Salts may enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Drospirenone. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Eplerenone: May enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Potassium Salts. Management: This combination is contraindicated in patients receiving eplerenone for treatment of hypertension. Potassium supplements may be needed to treat/prevent hypokalemia in selected patients with heart failure receiving eplerenone and high dose loop diuretics.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Heparin: May enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Potassium Salts.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Heparins (Low Molecular Weight): May enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Potassium Salts.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Mecamylamine: Alkalinizing Agents may increase the serum concentration of Mecamylamine. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Memantine: Alkalinizing Agents may increase the serum concentration of Memantine. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Nicorandil: May enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Potassium Salts.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: Potassium Salts may enhance the hyperkalemic effect of Potassium-Sparing Diuretics.  Management: Avoid coadministration of a potassium-sparing diuretic and a potassium salt. This combination should only be used in cases of significant hypokalemia, and only if serum potassium can be closely monitored.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>QuiNINE: Alkalinizing Agents may increase the serum concentration of QuiNINE. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified. Frequency not defined.</p><p>Cardiovascular: Cardiac abnormalities</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Metabolic alkalosis, calcium levels, hyperkalemia, hypernatremia</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Tetany</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with heart failure or hypertension; contains sodium.</p><p>• Edema: Use with caution in patients with peripheral or pulmonary edema; contains sodium.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Citrate is converted to bicarbonate in the liver; this conversion may be blocked in patients in hepatic failure.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; contains sodium.

See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p>• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; Zar, 2007).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Serum potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate; urinary pH</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to lower acid levels in the urine.</p><p>• It is used to prevent gout attacks.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug. Tell your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms that may be related to a very bad side effect:</b></p><p>• High potassium like abnormal heartbeat, confusion, dizziness, passing out, weakness, shortness of breath, or numbness or tingling feeling</p><p>• Signs of an allergic reaction, like rash; hives; itching; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever; wheezing; tightness in the chest or throat; trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking; unusual hoarseness; or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Note:</b> This is not a comprehensive list of all side effects.
