</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension contains betaxolol hydrochloride, a cardiovascular (beta<span class="Sub">1</span>) adrenoceptor antagonist and pilocarpine hydrochloride, a cholinergic parasympathomimetic agent.</p><p>Betaxolol hydrochloride is a white, crystalline powder. Its chemical name is (±)-1[p-(cyclopropylmethoxy)ethyl]phenoxy]-3-(isopropylamino)-2-propanol hydrochloride with an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">29</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>HCl and a molecular weight of 343.89. The chemical structure of betaxolol hydrochloride is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Pilocarpine hydrochloride is a white powder. Its chemical name is 2(3H)-furanone, 3-ethyldihydro-4-[(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-methyl]-, monohydrochloride, (3S-cis)- with an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">11</span>H<span class="Sub">16</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>HCl and a molecular weight of 244.72. The chemical structure of pilocarpine hydrochloride is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Each mL of Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension contains the following:</p><p>Active: Betaxolol hydrochloride 2.8 mg equivalent to 2.5 mg betaxolol base and pilocarpine hydrochloride 17.5 mg;</p><p>Preservative: Benzalkonium chloride 0.01%.</p><p>Inactive: Mannitol, poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) sulfonic acid, carbomer 934P, boric acid, edetate disodium, sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid to adjust to a pH 6.0-8.0 and purified water.</p><p>Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension is provided as a two-part unit for combination by the Pharmacist. It consists of the following components: Part I – a glass syringe containing pilocarpine hydrochloride 8.75%, sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid (pH 5.0 ± 0.2) and purified water to 1.6 mL; and Part II – a DROP-TAINER<span class="Sup">®</span> containing betaxolol 0.313%, poly(styrene-divinyl benzene) sulfonic acid, carbomer 934P, boric acid, mannitol, edetate disodium, benzalkonium chloride, sodium hydroxide (pH 8.0 ± 0.2) and purified water to 6.4 mL.</p><p>Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension is prepared by affixing a one-inch, blunt, 27 gauge cannula (supplied) to the syringe containing the pilocarpine hydrochloride solution and adding the entire contents of the syringe through the opening in the dropper tip to the DROP-TAINER<span class="Sup">®</span> containing the betaxolol suspension and mixing well. The final pH of the combination suspension is 6.0 to 8.0</p><p><span class="Bold">ADD CONTENTS OF PART I TO PART II AND MIX WELL IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO DISPENSING AND LABEL WITH A TWO (2) WEEK EXPIRATION DATE</span></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Betaxolol hydrochloride, a cardioselective (beta<span class="Sub">1</span>) adrenoceptor antagonist, does not have significant membrane-stabilizing (local anesthetic) activity and is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic action. Orally administered beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce cardiac output in healthy subjects and subjects with heart disease. In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists may inhibit the sympathetic stimulatory effect necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function.</p><p>Pilocarpine is a direct acting cholinergic parasympathomimetic agent which acts through direct stimulation of muscarinic neuroreceptors and smooth muscle such as the iris and secretory glands. Each of these compounds lowers elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) by different mechanisms of action. Betaxolol lowers IOP predominately by decreasing aqueous humor production. Pilocarpine lowers IOP predominantly by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor from the eye.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension dosed TID was evaluated in two prospective, multicenter, controlled clinical trials. In both controlled studies, Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension dosed TID provide up to an additional 1-3 mmHg IOP lowering from the BETOPTIC<span class="Sup">®</span>-S BID baseline. Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo has not been shown to be superior to any other beta-blocker aside from Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>-S.</p><p>The potential for systemic absorption was evaluated following topical use of Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension TID. After five and eight days of dosing with Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension TID, plasma levels of betaxolol were below the level of quantification (2.0 ng/mL) indicating that TID dosing results in a low systemic exposure to the drug. Plasma concentrations of pilocarpine were higher following topical ocular administration of Pilocarpine HCl Solution 4% QID than after dosing with Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension TID.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>-S (failed to achieve target IOP determined after multiple measurements over time).</p><p>It is <span class="Bold">not</span> known whether Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo is equivalent in IOP lowering efficacy to the administration of Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>-S 0.25% and pilocarpine 1.75% dosed separately. It is <span class="Bold">not</span> known whether Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo is equivalent to other beta-blockers given in combination with pilocarpine.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension is contraindicated in patients with sinus bradycardia, greater than a first degree atrioventricular heart block, cardiogenic shock or patients with overt cardiac failure.</p><p>Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension is also contraindicated in conditions where miosis is undesirable (e.g., peripheral anterior synechia, trauma, acute inflammatory disease of the anterior chamber, glaucoma occurring or persisting after extracapsular cataract extraction when posterior synechia may occur, and papillary block glaucoma).</p><p>Hypersensitivity to any component of this product.</p><h2>WARNINGS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOT FOR INJECTION OR ORAL ADMINISTRATION. FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY. COMBINE PARTS I AND II PRIOR TO DISPENSING AND LABEL WITH A TWO (2) WEEK EXPIRATION DATE</span></p><p>Topically applied beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be absorbed systemically. The same adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory reactions and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma and, rarely, death in association with cardiac failure, have been reported with topical application of beta-adrenergic blocking agents.</p><p>Betaxolol has been shown to have a minor effect on heart rate and blood pressure in clinical studies. Caution should be used in treating patients with a history of cardiac failure or heart block. Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension should be discontinued at the first signs of cardiac failure.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ocular.</span> Pilocarpine-induced miosis may cause difficulty in dark adaptation. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in night driving and hazardous tasks performed in poor illumination.</p><p>In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, the immediate treatment objective is to re-open the angle by constriction of the pupil with a miotic agent. Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension contains pilocarpine HCl 1.75%, a miotic, which, while having an effect on the pupil, is <span class="Bold">unlikely</span> to be sufficient to effectively treat an angle closure event.</p><p><span class="Bold">Diabetes Mellitus.</span> Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs of acute hypoglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Thyrotoxicosis.</span> Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, which might precipitate a thyroid storm.</p><p><span class="Bold">Muscle Weakness.</span> Beta-adrenergic blockage has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g., diplopia, ptosis and generalized weakness).</p><p><span class="Bold">Major Surgery.</span> Consideration should be given to the gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to general anesthesia because of reduced ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated sympathetic reflex stimuli.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pulmonary</span>. Caution should be exercised in the treatment of glaucoma patients with excessive restriction of pulmonary function. There have been reports of asthmatic attacks and pulmonary distress during betaxolol treatment. Although rechallenges of such patients with ophthalmic betaxolol have not adversely affected pulmonary function test results, the possibility of adverse pulmonary effects in patients sensitive to beta blockers cannot be ruled out.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk from Anaphylactic Reaction.</span> While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or disruption of the ocular epithelial surface.</p><p>The preservative in Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo should not be administered while wearing soft contact lenses.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension should be observed for a potential additive effect on the intraocular pressure or on the known systemic effects of beta blockade.</p><p>Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) or calcium-channel blockers because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.</p><p>Betaxolol is an adrenergic blocking agent; therefore, caution should be exercised in patients using concomitant adrenergic psychotropic drugs.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Lifetime studies with betaxolol hydrochloride have been completed in mice at oral doses of 6, 20, or 60 mg/kg/day and in rats at 3, 12, or 48 mg/kg/day; betaxolol hydrochloride demonstrated no carcinogenic effect. Higher dose levels were not tested. In a variety of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial and mammalian cell assays, betaxolol hydrochloride was nonmutagenic.</p><p>There have been no long-term studies done using pilocarpine in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Reproduction, teratology, and peri- and postnatal studies have been conducted with orally administered betaxolol HCl in rats and rabbits. There was evidence of drug related post-implantation loss in rabbits and rats at dose levels above 12 mg/kg and 128 mg/kg, respectively. Betaxolol HCl was shown not to be teratogenic, however, and there were no other adverse effects on reproduction at subtoxic dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of betaxolol HCl or pilocarpine in pregnant women. Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether topical ocular betaxolol, pilocarpine or Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension is excreted in human milk; however, oral betaxolol is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension usage, taking into account the benefit of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">In multi-center controlled clinical trials of Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension the adverse events reported in an approximately 5 to 20% incidence of patients were: headaches, blurred vision, dim vision, abnormal vision, and vitreous disorder.</p><p>In the 3-month controlled clinical trials, 12% of patients enrolled on Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo treatment discontinued the therapy within the first two weeks of treatment because of intolerance due to adverse reactions. In a 24-month long-term safety study, by Month-12, 20% of patients had discontinued and by the Month-24 endpoint, 55% of patients had discontinued Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo therapy.</p><p>The following adverse events were reported at an incidence of 1 to 4% of patients: bronchitis, browache, constipation, dizziness, hyperemia, ocular discomfort, nausea, and pain.</p><p>The following adverse events were reported in less than 1% of the patients: abnormal dreams, asthenia, asthma, blepharitis, conjunctival edema, lid erythema, lid margin crusting, lid spasm, palpitation, periorbital edema, photophobia, scotoma, synechiae, and tearing.</p><p>In addition, the following adverse events have been associated with ophthalmic formulations containing betaxolol or pilocarpine:</p><p><span class="Bold">Ocular</span>: Discomfort characterized by burning and stinging upon instillation, ciliary spasm, conjunctival vascular congestion, myopia (especially in younger individuals who have recently started therapy), and reduced visual acuity in poor illumination (frequently experienced by older individuals and individuals with lens opacity), corneal punctate keratitis, itching, dryness of eyes, erythema, inflammation, discharge, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity and crusty lashes. Retinal detachments have been reported with the use of miotics such as pilocarpine and cataracts may occur with prolonged use of pilocarpine.</p><p>Additional ocular events reported with other formulations of betaxolol or pilocarpine include allergic reactions, decreased corneal sensitivity, edema, anisocoria, lacrimation, and superficial keratitis (corneal granularity).</p><p><span class="Bold">Systemic</span>: <span class="Bold">Cardiovascular</span>; Bradycardia, heart block, and congestive heart failure; <span class="Bold">Pulmonary</span>; Pulmonary distress characterized by dyspnea, bronchospasm, thickened bronchial secretions, asthma, and respiratory failure; <span class="Bold">Nervous System</span>; Insomnia, dizziness, vertigo, temporal or supraorbital headaches, depression, lethargy, and increase in signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis; <span class="Bold">Other</span>: Hives, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hair loss and glossitis.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No information is available on overdosage of Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension in humans. The symptoms which might be expected with an overdose of a systemically administered beta-1-adrenergic blocking agent are bradycardia, hypotension and acute cardiac failure. Symptoms associated with pilocarpine toxicity include sweating, salivation, gastrointestinal over activity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), tremors, bradycardia, hypotension, atrioventricular block, mental status changes, and bronchial constriction (in asthmatic patients).</p><h2>Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">One or two drops of Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension should be instilled in the affected eye(s) three-times daily.</p><h2>How Supplied</h2><p class="First">Betoptic<span class="Sup">®</span>Pilo Ophthalmic Suspension is supplied as two parts requiring mixing before dispensing. Part I consists of a glass syringe containing pilocarpine hydrochloride sealed in a sterile blister pack also containing a sterile, one inch, blunt, 27 gauge cannula.
