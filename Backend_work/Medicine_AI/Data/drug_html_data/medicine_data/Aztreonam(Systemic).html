Bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested. Monobactam structure makes cross-allergenicity with beta-lactams unlikely.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>IM: Well absorbed; IM and IV doses produce comparable serum concentrations</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Widely into body tissues, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchial secretions, peritoneal fluid, bile, and bone</p><p>V<sub>d</sub>: Neonates: 0.26 to 0.36 L/kg; Children: 0.2 to 0.29 L/kg; Adults: 0.15 to 0.18 L/kg (Brogden 1986)</p><p>Relative diffusion of antimicrobial agents from blood into CSF: Good only with inflammation (exceeds usual MICs)</p><p>CSF:blood level ratio: Meninges: Inflamed: 8% to 40%; Normal: ~1%</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hepatic (minor %)</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (60% to 70% as unchanged drug); feces (~12%)</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>IM: Within 60 minutes (Mattie 1988)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Neonates: &lt;7 days, ≤2.5 kg: 5.5 to 9.9 hours; &lt;7 days, &gt;2.5 kg: 2.6 hours; 1 week to 1 month: 2.4 hours</p><p>Children 2 months to 12 years: 1.7 hours</p><p>Children with cystic fibrosis: 1.3 hours</p><p>Adults: Normal renal function: 1.5 to 2 hours</p><p>End-stage renal disease: 6 to 8.4 hours (Brogden 1986)</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>56%</p><h2>Special Populations: Renal Function Impairment</h2><p>Serum half-life is prolonged.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p>Treatment of patients with urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, septicemia, skin/skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections caused by susceptible gram-negative bacilli</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Meningitis, bacterial</h3><p>Based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the management of bacterial meningitis and health care-associated ventriculitis and meningitis, aztreonam is an effective and recommended alternative therapy for meningitis due to beta-lactamase positive <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, Enterobacteriaceae, or <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and for health care-associated meningitis or ventriculitis requiring empiric therapy for gram-negative pathogens in patients with anaphylaxis to beta-lactams, in combination with other appropriate agents.</p><h3>Osteomyelitis, native vertebral</h3><p>Based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis in adults, aztreonam is an effective and recommended alternative treatment option for the treatment of native vertebral osteomyelitis due to <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>in patients with severe penicillin allergy and quinolone-resistant strains.</p><h3>Surgical prophylaxis (perioperative)</h3><p>Based on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Surgical Infection Society (SIS), and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery, aztreonam is an effective and recommended alternative agent (in combination with other antibiotics) for patients with beta-lactam allergy for a number of surgical procedures (eg, gastroduodenal, biliary tract, appendectomy, hysterectomy, urologic involving implanted prosthesis, liver transplantation, or pancreas and pancreas-kidney transplantation) and may be used first-line in combination with cefazolin for procedures involving implanted prosthetic material (eg, penile prosthesis).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to aztreonam or any component of the formulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Meningitis, bacterial (community-acquired or health care-associated) (alternative agent) (off-label use):</b> As a component of empiric therapy for health care-associated infection or pathogen-specific therapy (eg, <i>H. influenzae</i> (beta-lactamase positive), Enterobacteriaceae or <i>P. aeruginosa</i>): IV: 2 g every 6 to 8 hours; for empiric therapy, must be used in combination with other appropriate agents (IDSA [Tunkel 2004; Tunkel 2017]).</p><p><b>Moderately severe systemic infections: </b>1 g IV or IM or 2 g IV every 8 to 12 hours; maximum: 8 g/day. <b>Note:</b> IV route preferred for septicemia, intra-abdominal abscess, or peritonitis; higher doses (8 to 12 g/day) may be needed for patients with cystic fibrosis (Zobell 2013).</p><p><b>Osteomyelitis, native vertebral due to </b><i><b>P. aeruginosa </b></i><b>(off-label use): </b>IV: 2 g every 8 hours for 6 weeks. <b>Note: </b>Double coverage may be considered (ie, aztreonam plus an aminoglycoside) (IDSA [Berbari 2015]).</p><p><b>Pneumonia: </b></p><p><i>Community-acquired pneumonia: </i>For empiric therapy of inpatients at risk of infection with a resistant gram-negative pathogen, including<i> P. aeruginosa:</i> IV: 2 g every 8 hours as part of an appropriate combination regimen.
