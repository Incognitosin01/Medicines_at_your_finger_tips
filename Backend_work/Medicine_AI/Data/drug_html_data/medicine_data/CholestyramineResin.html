Management: Consider discontinuing drugs that may affect gallbladder motility prior to the use of sincalide to stimulate gallbladder contraction.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Spironolactone: Cholestyramine Resin may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Spironolactone. Specifically, the risks of developing metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia may be elevated with this combination. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Teriflunomide: Bile Acid Sequestrants may decrease the serum concentration of Teriflunomide.  Management: Unless using this combination to intentionally enhance teriflunomide elimination, consider an alternative to the bile acid sequestrants when possible.

Hemorrhoids may be worsened.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hypertriglyceridemia: Bile acid sequestrants should not be used in patients with baseline fasting triglyceride levels ≥300 mg/dL or type III hyperlipoproteinemia since severe triglyceride elevations may occur. Use bile acid sequestrants with caution in patients with triglyceride levels 250 to 299 mg/dL and evaluate a fasting lipid panel in 4 to 6 weeks after initiation; discontinue use if triglycerides are &gt;400 mg/dL (Stone 2013).</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use caution in patients with renal impairment.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Decreased absorption (orally administered drugs): Not to be taken simultaneously with many other medicines (decreased absorption).</p><p>• Patients susceptible to fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies: Use with caution in patients susceptible to fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K and folic acid may be decreased; patients should take vitamins 1 hour before or ≥4 hours after cholestyramine.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Phenylalanine: Some products may contain phenylalanine.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Hyperlipidemia: Secondary causes of hyperlipidemia should be ruled out prior to therapy.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p><b>ACC/AHA Blood Cholesterol Guideline recommendations (ACC/AHA [Grundy 2018]; ACC/AHA [Stone 2013]): </b>Lipid profile (fasting or nonfasting) before initiating treatment. Fasting lipid profile should be rechecked 4 to 12 weeks after starting therapy and every 3 to 12 months thereafter.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Cholestyramine is used off label to enhance leflunomide elimination. Use of the enhanced elimination procedure is recommended in all females of reproductive potential upon discontinuation of leflunomide. Pregnancy should be avoided until undetectable serum concentrations (&lt;0.02 mg/L) of leflunomide are verified (Brent 2001).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Lipid concentrations increase during pregnancy as required for normal fetal development. When increases are greater than expected, supervised dietary intervention should be initiated. Bile acid sequestrants are recommended when treatment is needed (Avis 2009; Jacobson 2015).</p><p>Cholestyramine is not absorbed systemically, but may interfere with maternal vitamin absorption; therefore, regular prenatal supplementation may not be adequate.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to lower cholesterol, to treat itching caused by bile duct blockage, or it may be given to you for other reasons.
