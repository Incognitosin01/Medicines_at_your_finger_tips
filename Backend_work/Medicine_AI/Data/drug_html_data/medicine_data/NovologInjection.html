</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Novolog Injection</h2><p class="First">NOVOLOG is a rapid acting human insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.</p><h2>Novolog Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><h3>Route of Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous Injection</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion (Insulin Pump)</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Intravenous Administration</span></span></p><h3>Dosage Information</h3><h3>Dosage Adjustment Due to Drug Interactions</h3><h3>Instructions for Mixing with Other Insulins</h3><p class="First">NOVOLOG subcutaneous injection route</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">• If NOVOLOG is mixed with NPH insulin, draw NOVOLOG into the syringe first and inject immediately after mixing.</span></p><p class="First">NOVOLOG continuous subcutaneous infusion route (Insulin Pump)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do NOT mix</span> <span class="Bold">NOVOLOG with any other insulin.</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">NOVOLOG 100 units per mL (U-100) is available as a clear and colorless solution for injection in:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">NOVOLOG is contraindicated:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Never Share a NOVOLOG FlexPen, NOVOLOG FlexTouch, PenFill Cartridge, or PenFill Cartridge Device between Patients</h3><p class="First">NOVOLOG FlexPen, NOVOLOG FlexTouch, PenFill cartridge, and PenFill cartridge devices should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using NOVOLOG vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.</p><h3>Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions <span class="following_xmChange">(</span>5.3<span class="following_xmChange">)]</span></span> <span class="following_xmChange">or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions <span class="following_xmChange">(</span></span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">, 6.3<span class="following_xmChange">)].</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Make any changes to a patient’s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed.</span></p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of all insulin therapies, including NOVOLOG. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).</p><p>Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>, or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia</span></span></p><p>The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of NOVOLOG may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia</span></span></p><p>Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Accidental mix-ups between NOVOLOG and other insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between NOVOLOG and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including NOVOLOG. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue NOVOLOG; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)].</span> NOVOLOG is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">All insulin products, including NOVOLOG, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration).</p><h3>Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists</h3><p class="First">Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including NOVOLOG, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.</p><h3>Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction</h3><p class="First">Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim subcutaneous injections with NOVOLOG may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The safety of NOVOLOG was evaluated in two treat-to-target trials of 6 months duration, conducted in subjects with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 596 patients with type 1 diabetes to NOVOLOG in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to NOVOLOG of 24 weeks. The mean age was 38.9 years. Fifty-one percent were male, 94% were Caucasian, 2% were Black and 4% were other races. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The mean duration of diabetes was 15.7 years and the mean HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> at baseline was 7.9%.</p><p>The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 91 patients with type 2 diabetes to NOVOLOG in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration to NOVOLOG of 24 weeks. The mean age was 56.6 years. Sixty-three percent were male, 76% were Caucasian, 9% were Black and 15% were other races. The mean BMI was 29.7 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The mean duration of diabetes was 12.7 years and the mean HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> at baseline was 8.1%.</p><p>Common adverse reactions were defined as events occurring in ≥5%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse events occurring at the same rate or greater for NOVOLOG-treated subjects than in comparator-treated subjects during clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus (other than hypoglycemia) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adverse reactions occurring in</span> ≥ <span class="Bold">5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with NOVOLOG and at the same rate or greater on NOVOLOG than on comparator</span></p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Injury accidental</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">3</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Adverse reactions occurring in</span> ≥ <span class="Bold">5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients treated with NOVOLOG and at the same rate or greater on NOVOLOG than on comparator</span></p><p class="First">Hyporeflexia</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">Onychomycosis</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">Sensory disturbance</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">Urinary tract infection</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">Chest pain</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Skin disorder</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Abdominal pain</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">Sinusitis</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">1</p><p><span class="Bold">Severe hypoglycemia</span></p><p>Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including NOVOLOG <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span> The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for NOVOLOG with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.</p><p>Severehypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia associated with central nervous system symptoms and requiring the intervention of another person or hospitalization.</p><p>The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult and pediatric patients receiving subcutaneous NOVOLOG with type 1 diabetes mellitus was 17% at 24 weeks and 6% at 24 weeks, respectively <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients receiving subcutaneous NOVOLOG with type 2 diabetes mellitus was 10% at 24 weeks.</p><p>The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, receiving NOVOLOG via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump was 2% at 16 weeks and 10% at 16 weeks respectively.</p><p>No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving NOVOLOG via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by external pump at 16 weeks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Allergic Reactions</span></p><p>Some patients taking insulin therapy, including NOVOLOG have experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(5.5)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Insulin initiation and glucose control intensification</span></p><p>Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to NOVOLOG in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p><p>In a 6-month study with a 6-month extension in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes, 99.8% of patients who received NOVOLOG were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 97.2% that were positive at baseline. A total of 92.1% of patients who received NOVOLOG were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 64.6% that were positive at baseline.</p><p>In a phase 3 type 1 diabetes clinical trial of NOVOLOG, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin, followed by a decrease to baseline values, was observed in regular human insulin and insulin aspart treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose.</p><h3>Post Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of NOVOLOG. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for NOVOLOG <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drugs:</span></p><p class="First">Antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, pramlintide, propoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analog (e.g., octreotide), and sulfonamide antibiotics.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Intervention:</span></p><p class="First">Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when NOVOLOG is co-administered with these drugs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of NOVOLOG</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drugs:</span></p><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, estrogens, glucagon, isoniazid, niacin, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., albuterol, epinephrine, terbutaline), and thyroid hormones.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Intervention:</span></p><p class="First">Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when NOVOLOG is co-administered with these drugs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of NOVOLOG</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drugs:</span></p><p class="First">Alcohol, beta-blockers, clonidine, and lithium salts.

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8-times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, respectively. Pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities were seen at higher exposures, which are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia. These effects were similar to those observed in rats administered regular human insulin <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> &gt;7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> &gt;10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications.

However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the</p><p>majority of the trials.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of NOVOLOG in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for NOVOLOG, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NOVOLOG, or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">NOVOLOG is approved for use in children for subcutaneous daily injections and for subcutaneous continuous infusion by external insulin pump <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]</span>. NOVOLOG has not been studied in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age. NOVOLOG has not been studied in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of patients (n=1,375) treated with NOVOLOG in 3 controlled clinical studies, 2.6% (n=36) were 65 years of age or over. One-half of these patients had type 1 diabetes (18/1285) and the other half had type 2 diabetes (18/90). The HbA<span class="Sub">1c</span> response to NOVOLOG, as compared to regular human insulin, did not differ by age.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent NOVOLOG dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent NOVOLOG dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6)]</span>. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately.</p><h2>Novolog Injection Description</h2><p class="First">NOVOLOG (insulin aspart injection) is a rapid-acting human insulin analog used to lower blood glucose. NOVOLOG is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing <span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> (baker's yeast). Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">256</span>H<span class="Sub">381</span>N<span class="Sub">65</span>0<span class="Sub">79</span>S<span class="Sub">6</span> and a molecular weight of 5825.8.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 1. Structural formula of insulin aspart.</p><p>NOVOLOG is a sterile, aqueous, clear, and colorless solution, that contains insulin aspart 100 units/mL, glycerin 16 mg/mL, phenol 1.50 mg/mL, metacresol 1.72 mg/mL, zinc 19.6 mcg/mL, disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate 1.25 mg/mL, sodium chloride 0.58 mg/mL and water for injection. NOVOLOG has a pH of 7.2-7.6. Hydrochloric acid 10% and/or sodium hydroxide 10% may be added to adjust pH.</p><h2>Novolog Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The primary activity of insulin, including NOVOLOGis the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Subcutaneous administration</span></p><p>The pharmacodynamic profile of NOVOLOG given subcutaneously in 22 patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 2. The maximum glucose-lowering effect of NOVOLOG occurred between 1 and 3 hours after subcutaneous injection (0.15 units/kg). The duration of action for NOVOLOG is 3 to 5 hours. The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs such as NOVOLOG may vary considerably in different individuals orwithin the same individual. The parameters of NOVOLOG activity (time of onset, peak time and duration) as designated in Figure 2 should be considered only as general guidelines. The rate of insulin absorption and onset of activity is affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 2.

You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them.</span></p><p>NovoLog FlexPen is a disposable, single-patient-use, dial-a-dose insulin pen. You can select doses from 1 to 60 units in increments of 1 unit. NovoLog FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine, NovoFine Plus or NovoTwist needles.</p><p><span class="Bold">Getting ready</span></p><p>Make sure you have the following items:</p><p><span class="Bold">Preparing your NovoLog FlexPen</span></p><p>Wash your hands with soap and water. Before you start to prepare your injection, check the label to make sure that you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you take more than 1 type of insulin. NovoLog should look clear and colorless. Do not use your NovoLog FlexPen if the liquid contains particles or is colored.</p><p><span class="Bold">A</span>. Pull off the pen cap (see diagram A).</p><p>Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab.</p><p><span class="Bold">B. Attaching the needle</span></p><p>Remove the protective tab from a disposable needle.</p><p>Screw the needle tightly onto your FlexPen. It is important that the needle is put on straight (see diagram B).</p><p>Never place a disposable needle on your NovoLog FlexPen until you are ready to take your injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">C.</span> Pull off the big outer needle cap (see diagram C).</p><p><span class="Bold">D.</span> Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of it) (see diagram D).</p><p><span class="Bold">Giving the airshot before each injection</span></p><p>Before each injection small amounts of air may collect in the cartridge during normal use. To avoid injecting air and to ensure proper dosing:</p><p><span class="Bold">E.</span> Turn the dose selector to select 2 units (see diagram E).</p><p><span class="Bold">F.</span> Hold your NovoLog FlexPen with the needle pointing up. Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to make any air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge (see diagram F).</p><p><span class="Bold">G.</span> Keep the needle pointing upwards, press the push-button all the way in (see diagram G). The dose selector returns to 0.</p><p>A drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. If not, change the needle and repeat the procedure no more than 6 times.</p><p>If you do not see a drop of insulin after 6 times, do not use the NovoLog FlexPen and contact Novo Nordisk at 1-800-727-6500.</p><p>A small air bubble may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected.</p><p><span class="Bold">Selecting your dose</span></p><p>Check and make sure that the dose selector is set at 0.</p><p><span class="Bold">H.</span> Turn the dose selector to the number of units you need to inject. The pointer should line up with your dose.</p><p>The dose can be corrected either up or down by turning the dose selector in either direction until the correct dose lines up with the pointer (see diagram H). When turning the dose selector, be careful not to press the push-button as insulin will come out.</p><p>You cannot select a dose larger than the number of units left in the cartridge.</p><p>You will hear a click for every single unit dialed. Do not set the dose by counting the number of clicks you hear because you may get an incorrect dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Giving the injection</span></p><p>Do the injection exactly as shown to you by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before injecting. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab and let the area dry.</p><p>NovoLog can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area, buttocks, upper legs (thighs), or upper arms.</p><p>Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. <span class="Bold">Do not</span> use the same injection site for each injection. <span class="Bold">Do not</span> inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. <span class="Bold">Do not</span> inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin.</p><p><span class="Bold">I.</span> Insert the needle into your skin.</p><p>Inject the dose by pressing the push-button all the way in until the 0 lines up with the pointer (see diagram I). Be careful only to push the button when injecting.</p><p>Turning the dose selector will not inject insulin.</p><p><span class="Bold">J.</span> Keep the needle in the skin for at least 6 seconds, and keep the push-button pressed all the way in until the needle has been pulled out from the skin (see diagram J). This will make sure that the full dose has been given.</p><p>You may see a drop of insulin at the needle tip. This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received. If blood appears after you take the needle out of your skin, press the injection site lightly with an alcohol swab. <span class="Bold">Do not rub the area.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">After the injection</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Do not recap the needle.</span> Recapping can lead to a needle stick injury.  Remove the needle from the NovoLog FlexPen after each injection and dispose of it. This helps to prevent infection, leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin.</p><p>If you do not have a sharps container, carefully slip the needle into the outer needle cap. Safely remove the needle and throw it away as soon as you can.</p><p><span class="Bold">K</span>. Put the pen cap on the NovoLog FlexPen and store the NovoLog FlexPen without the needle attached (see diagram K).</p><p>Storing without the needle attached helps prevent leaking, blocking of the needle, and air from entering the Pen.</p><p><span class="Bold">How should I store NovoLog FlexPen?</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Maintenance</span></p><p>For the safe and proper use of your FlexPen be sure to handle it with care. Avoid dropping your FlexPen as it may damage it. If you are concerned that your FlexPen is damaged, use a new one. You can clean the outside of your FlexPen by wiping it with a damp cloth. Do not soak or wash your FlexPen as it may damage it. Do not refill your FlexPen.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ</span> Remove the needle from the NovoLog FlexPen after each injection. This helps to ensure sterility, prevent leakage of insulin, and will help to make sure you inject the right dose of insulin for future injections.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ</span> Be careful when handling used needles to avoid needle sticks and transfer of infectious diseases.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ</span> Keep your NovoLog FlexPen and needles out of the reach of children.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ</span> Use NovoLog FlexPen as directed to treat your diabetes.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ Do not</span> share your NovoLog FlexPen or needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection, or</p><p>get a serious infection from them.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ</span> Always use a new needle for each injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ</span> Novo Nordisk is not responsible for harm due to using this insulin pen with products not recommended by Novo</p><p>Nordisk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ</span> As a precautionary measure, always carry a spare insulin delivery device in case your NovoLog FlexPen is lost or damaged.</p><p><span class="Bold">Δ</span> Remember to keep the disposable NovoLog FlexPen with you. Do not leave it in a car or other location where it can get too hot or too cold.</p><p>This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Revised: 11/2019</p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL - 10 mL NovoLog Vial</h2><p class="First">NDC 0169-7501-11</p><p>List 750111</p><p><span class="Bold">NovoLog<span class="Sup">®</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Insulin aspart Injection</span></p><p>One 10 mL multi-dose vial</p><p>100 units/mL (U-100)</p><p>Rx only</p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL - 3 mL NovoLog PenFill</h2><p class="First">NDC 0169-3303-12 List 330312</p><p><span class="Bold">NovoLog<span class="Sup">®</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">PenFill<span class="Sup">®</span></span></p><p>Insulin aspart Injection</p><p><span class="Bold">For Single Patient Use Only</span></p><p>3 mL cartridges</p><p>100 units/mL (U-100)</p><p>5 cartridges per package</p><p>For use with Novo Nordisk 3 mL PenFill<span class="Sup">®</span> cartridge compatible delivery devices and NovoFine<span class="Sup">®</span> disposable needles.</p><p><span class="Bold">Keep in a refrigerator at 36<span class="Sup">o</span>F to 46<span class="Sup">o</span>F (2<span class="Sup">o</span>C to 8<span class="Sup">o</span>C) until first use.
