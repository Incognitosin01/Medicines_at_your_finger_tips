It works inside the bowels to reduce inflammation and other symptoms of the disease.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Asacol 800</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Asacol®</i> and <i>Delzicol®</i> for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in children 5 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 5 years of age and for the prevention of ulcerative colitis in children.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Lialda®</i> for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in children 5 years of age and older weighing 24 kilograms (kg) or more. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 5 years of age, weighing less than 24 kg, or for the prevention of ulcerative colitis in children.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Apriso®</i>, <i>Asacol® HD</i>, or <i>Pentasa®</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mesalamine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have blood problems and age-related kidney, liver, or heart disease, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving mesalamine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.
