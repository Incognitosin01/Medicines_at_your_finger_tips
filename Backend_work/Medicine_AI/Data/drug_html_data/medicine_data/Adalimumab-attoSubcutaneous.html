<html><head></head><body><h1>Adalimumab-atto (Subcutaneous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> adalimumab (ay-da-LIM-ue-mab - atto)</p><p>Patients treated with adalimumab-atto are at increased risk of infection, some of which may become serious and lead to hospitalization or death. These infections have included TB, invasive fungal infections, bacterial, viral, and those caused by opportunistic pathogens including Legionella and Listeria. The risks and benefits of therapy should be carefully considered prior to treatment initiation in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Evaluate for latent TB and treat if necessary prior to initiating therapy. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment, including the possible development of TB in patients who tested negative prior to treatment. Consider empirical antifungal therapy in at-risk patients who develop severe systemic illness. Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in pediatric and adolescent patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, including adalimumab products. Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), usually fatal, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products, primarily in adolescent and young adult males with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Most cases occurred in patients receiving concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Adalimumab</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for adalimumab-atto</h2><p>Adalimumab-atto injection is used to treat the symptoms and prevent the progression of moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. It is used in children 4 years of age and older for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Adalimumab-atto is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body. Psoriatic arthritis usually occurs with a skin condition called psoriasis. Adalimumab-atto may be used alone or in combination with medicines (eg, methotrexate).</p><p>Adalimumab-atto injection is also used to treat the symptoms of active Crohn’s disease in patients who have not been helped by other medicines (eg, infliximab). It is also used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in patients who have been treated with other medicines (eg, azathioprine, corticosteroids, or 6-mercaptopurine) that did not work well. Adalimumab-atto may also be used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, which is a skin disease with red patches and white scales that don’t go away.</p><p>Adalimumab-atto is available only with your doctor’s prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using adalimumab-atto</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For adalimumab-atto, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to adalimumab-atto or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab-atto injection for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 4 to 17 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 4 years of age for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and safety and efficacy have not been established for other uses in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab-atto injection in the elderly. However, adalimumab-atto may cause serious infections and cancer more often in the elderly, which may require caution in patients receiving adalimumab-atto injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking adalimumab-atto, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using adalimumab-atto with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of adalimumab-atto.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of adalimumab-atto</h2><p>Adalimumab-atto is given as a shot under your skin. Adalimumab-atto may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using adalimumab-atto at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>Adalimumab-atto comes with a Medication Guide and patient Instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>If you use adalimumab-atto at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself or your child a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems.</p><p>Adalimumab-atto is available in 2 forms. You may use a prefilled SureClick® autoinjector or a prefilled syringe.</p><p>To use the autoinjector or syringe:</p><ul>
<li>First, gather the items you will need on a clean, flat surface using a cloth or towel in a well-lighted area.</li>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using adalimumab-atto.</li>
<li>Remove the carton with the syringe or pen from the refrigerator and place it on the cloth.</li>
<li>Allow 15 to 30 minutes for the syringe or autoinjector to warm up to room temperature. Do not warm adalimumab-atto in any other way.</li>
<li>Do not remove the needle cover on the prefilled syringe or autoinjector while allowing the medicine to reach room temperature. Remove these immediately before use.</li>
<li>Check the liquid in the syringe or autoinjector using the viewing window. It should be clear and colorless. If it is cloudy, discolored, or has particles floating in it, do not use the syringe or autoinjector.</li>
<li>Check that the amount of liquid in the autoinjector is the same or close to the fill line seen on the window. The fill line shows a full dose of the medicine. If the autoinjector does not have the full amount of liquid, do not use it. Call your pharmacist. If the liquid is clear, place it on a clean, flat surface. Do not shake the medicine.</li>
<li>Check the expiration date on the prefilled syringe or autoinjector, and make sure the date has not passed. Do not use the medicine if the date has passed.</li>
<li>Choose an injection site on your body (eg, thigh, abdomen or stomach area). Clean the injection site with a fresh alcohol wipe and let it dry.</li>
<li>Remove the cap or needle cover when you are ready to inject. Inject the full amount of medicine within a few minutes after the cap or cover has been removed.</li>
<li>Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas.</li>
<li>Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, or hard. If you have psoriasis, do not inject into a raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patch or into skin lesions.</li>
<li>You might have a small amount of blood or liquid at the injection site. Press and hold a dry, clean cotton ball on the injection site for 10 seconds, but do not rub it.</li>
<li>Throw away used syringes or autoinjector in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through (puncture-resistant). Keep this container away from children and pets.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of adalimumab-atto will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of adalimumab-atto. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>If you miss a dose of adalimumab-atto, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><p>Store in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.</p><p>Protect the medicine from direct light. Keep your medicine and supplies in the original packages until you are ready to use them. Also, when traveling, store the medicine in a cool carrier with an ice pack or store at room temperature for up to 14 days.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using adalimumab-atto</h2><p>If you will be using adalimumab-atto for a long time, <i>it is very important that your doctor check the progress of you or your child at regular visits</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if adalimumab-atto is working properly and to decide whether you should continue to use it. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>You or your child will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using adalimumab-atto. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>Adalimumab-atto can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, which may increase the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you or your child notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. Using abatacept (Orencia®) or anakinra (Kineret®) together with adalimumab-atto may increase your risk of having serious side effects.</p><p>Adalimumab-atto may cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after adalimumab-atto is used. A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this type of medicine have developed certain types of cancer (eg, leukemia). Some patients also developed a type of cancer called lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you or your child have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss. Also, check with your doctor right away if your skin has red, scaly patches, or raised bumps that are filled with pus.</p><p>Adalimumab-atto may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, swelling of the face, throat, legs, or feet, troubled breathing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms: shortness of breath, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, or sudden weight gain. These may be signs of a heart condition called congestive heart failure (CHF).</p><p>Some people who have used adalimumab-atto developed lupus-like symptoms during treatment and got better after the medicine was stopped. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having chest pains, shortness of breath, joint pain, or a rash on your cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.</p><p>Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you or your child are being treated with adalimumab-atto. Your child’s vaccines need to be current before he or she begins using adalimumab-atto. Be sure to ask your child’s doctor if you have any questions about this. The needle cover of the autoinjector or prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you or your child have a latex allergy before you start using adalimumab-atto.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Adalimumab-atto side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
