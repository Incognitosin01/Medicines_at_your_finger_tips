Insulin is a hormone that works by lowering levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin that starts to work several hours after injection and keeps working evenly for 24 hours.</p><p>Lantus is used to improve blood sugar control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Lantus is for use in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in children at least 6 years old with type 1 diabetes.</p><p><b>Some brands of insulin glargine are for use only in adults. Carefully follow all instructions for the brand of insulin glargine you are using.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Lantus if you are having an episode of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), or if you are in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis (call your doctor for treatment).</p><p>Never share a Lantus injection pen or cartridge with another person. Sharing injection pens or cartridges can allow disease such as hepatitis or HIV to pass from one person to another.</p><p>Not all insulin glargine brands are equal in dosing. Follow your doctorâ€™s instructions when changing from one brand to another. If there are any changes in the brand, strength, or type of insulin you use, your dosage needs may change.</p><p>Lantus is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, foot care, eye care, dental care, and testing your blood sugar. Follow your diet, medication, and exercise routines very closely. Changing any of these factors can affect your blood sugar levels.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Lantus side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergy reaction to Lantus:</b> redness or swelling where an injection was given, itchy skin rash over the entire body, trouble breathing, fast heartbeats, feeling like you might pass out, or swelling in your tongue or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
