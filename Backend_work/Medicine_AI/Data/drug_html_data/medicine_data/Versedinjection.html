<li>
<p>narrow-angle glaucoma.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>narrow-angle glaucoma.</p><p>If possible before you receive Versed, tell your caregivers if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>open-angle glaucoma;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>congestive heart failure;</p>

</ul><p>open-angle glaucoma;</p><p>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);</p><p>congestive heart failure;</p><p>if you recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, or opioid medications; or</p><p>if you regularly take any medication.</p><p><b>Diazepam may harm an unborn baby,</b> and generally should not be used during pregnancy. However, the benefit of receiving diazepam to treat it may outweigh any risk to the unborn baby.</p><p><b>Sedatives used during surgery may affect brain development in a child under 3, or an unborn baby whose mother receives  Versed during late pregnancy.</b> These effects may be more likely when a sedative is used for 3 hours or longer, or used for repeated procedures. Effects on brain development could cause learning or behavior problems later in life.</p><p>Negative brain effects from sedatives have been seen in animal studies. However, studies in human children receiving single short uses of this medicine have not shown a likely effect on behavior or learning. More research is needed.</p><p>In some cases, your doctor may decide to postpone a surgery based on these risks. Treatment may not be delayed in the case of life-threatening conditions, medical emergencies, or surgery needed to correct certain birth defects.</p><p>Ask your doctor for information about all medicines that will be used during your surgery, and how long the surgery will last.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p>In an emergency, you may not be able to tell caregivers if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Make sure any doctor caring for your pregnancy or your baby knows you received this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is  Versed given?</h2><p>Versed is injected into a muscle, or as an infusion into a vein. You will receive this injection in a medical, dental, or surgical setting.</p><p>Versed is usually given as a single dose just before a surgery or medical procedure. For mechanical ventilation, this medicine is given using a continuous infusion that keeps the patient sedated around the clock.</p><p>Versed can make you very drowsy, dizzy, or light-headed. These effects may last longer in older adults. Use caution to avoid falling or accidental injury after you have received this medicine. You may need help getting out of bed for several hours.</p><p>After treatment with Versed, you will be watched to make sure the medication is working and does not cause harmful side effects. Your breathing, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs will be watched closely.</p><p>When Versed is discontinued after long-term use, you may have withdrawal symptoms. The most common withdrawal symptoms are hallucinations, tremors, sweating, muscle cramps, stomach pain, and vomiting. You may also have a seizure (convulsions).</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive  Versed in a clinical setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Since this medication is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving  Versed?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol shortly after receiving Versed.</b>  Versed can increase the effects of alcohol, which could be dangerous.</p><p>Versed can cause extreme drowsiness that may last for several hours after you have received the medication. Older adults may feel sleepy for even longer.</p><p>Avoid driving or doing anything that requires you to be awake and alert until the effects of this medicine have worn off completely.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Versed side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Versed can slow or stop your breathing, especially if you have recently used an opioid medication, alcohol, or other drugs that can slow your breathing.</b> Your caregivers will watch you for symptoms such as weak or shallow breathing.</p><p>Tell your caregivers right away if you have:</p><ul>
