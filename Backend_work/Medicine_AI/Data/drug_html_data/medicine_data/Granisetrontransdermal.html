Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment.</p><p>It is not known whether granisetron transdermal passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use granisetron transdermal?</h2><p>The granisetron transdermal skin patch is usually applied at least 24 to 48 hours before the start of your chemotherapy. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use  granisetron in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Apply the patch to clean, dry, and hairless skin on the outer part of your upper arm. Avoid placing the patch on skin that is red, irritated, or damaged. Press the patch firmly into place and make sure it is well sealed around the edges.</p><p>Leave the patch in place during your chemotherapy treatment, and for at least 24 hours after your treatment has ended. Peel off the patch gently when removing it.</p><p>You may continue wearing a skin patch for up to 7 days if needed, depending on your chemotherapy schedule. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>Choose a different place on your body to wear the patch each time you put on a new one. Do not use the same skin area twice within 7 days.</p><p><b>Do not wear more than one granisetron transdermal patch at a time.</b> Using extra skin patches will not make the medicine more effective. Never cut a skin patch.</p><p>If a patch falls off, try sticking it back into place. If it does not stick well, put on a new patch and leave it on only for the rest of your wearing time. Do not change your patch removal schedule.</p><p>After removing a patch, fold it in half so it sticks together and throw it away in a place where children or pets cannot get to it.</p><p>Granisetron transdermal is not likely to be useful if you keep using it during times when you are not receiving chemotherapy.</p><p>Do not share this medicine with another person.</p><p>Keep each patch in its foil pouch until you are ready to use it. Store the pouches in their original container at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you forget to apply a granisetron skin patch at least 24 hours before your chemotherapy is scheduled to start. Do not use extra patches to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using granisetron transdermal?</h2><p>While you are wearing the skin patch, avoid exposing it to sunlight or tanning beds.

Wear protective clothing over your arms while you are wearing the skin patch and for at least 10 days after you remove a patch.</p><p>Do not cover treated skin with a heating pad.
