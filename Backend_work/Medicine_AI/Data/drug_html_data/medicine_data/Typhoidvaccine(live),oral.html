Untreated typhoid infection may lead to kidney failure, or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. If the infection spreads to your gallbladder, you could become a chronic carrier of the bacteria that causes typhoid. A carrier may have no symptoms but is capable of spreading the infection to others.</p><p>Typhoid is spread through contact with the stool (bowel movements) of a person infected with the bacteria. This usually occurs by eating food or drinking water that has become contaminated with feces from an infected person. Once in the digestive tract, typhoid infection can spread to the blood and other parts of the body.</p><p>Typhoid can cause high fever, muscle aches, severe headache, weakness, confusion or agitation, loss of appetite, stomach pain, diarrhea or constipation, and rose-colored spots on the skin.</p><p>Typhoid vaccine is used to help prevent this disease in adults and children who are at least 6 years old. Although not part of a routine immunization schedule in the U.S., typhoid vaccine is recommended for:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>people who travel to area where typhoid fever is common (non-industrialized parts of the world, especially Asia, Africa, and Central or South America);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people who live with someone who is a typhoid carrier; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>laboratory workers who may come into contact with Salmonella typhi in a work setting.</p>

<li>
<p>a fever with any type of infection or illness; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weak immune system caused by disease or by using certain medicine.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>a fever with any type of infection or illness; or</p><p>weak immune system caused by disease or by using certain medicine.</p><p>If you have any of these other conditions, your vaccine may need to be postponed or not given at all:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>stomach flu or any illness with vomiting or diarrhea;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are taking an antibiotic, especially a sulfa drug; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you plan to start taking anti-malaria medicine within 10 days after receiving a typhoid oral vaccine.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>stomach flu or any illness with vomiting or diarrhea;</p><p>if you are taking an antibiotic, especially a sulfa drug; or</p><p>if you plan to start taking anti-malaria medicine within 10 days after receiving a typhoid oral vaccine.</p><p>You can still receive a vaccine if you have a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving this vaccine.</p><p>It is not known whether typhoid vaccine will harm an unborn baby. However, if you are at a high risk for infection with typhoid fever during pregnancy, your doctor should determine whether you need this vaccine.</p><p>It may not be safe to breast-feed a baby while you are using  typhoid vaccine (live), oral. Ask your doctor about any risks.</p><h2>How should I take typhoid vaccine?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>The typhoid oral vaccine is given in a set of 4 capsules. Take 1 capsule every other day at the same time of the day, such as when you first wake up.</p><p>You will take a capsule every other day for 7 days. You will need to skip a day between capsules. Follow all instructions on the medicine package.</p><p>Take this medicine with a full glass of cool or lukewarm water. Avoid very hot or cold water, which could cause the capsule to dissolve too quickly.</p><p>Swallow the capsule as quickly as possible after placing it in your mouth.</p><p>Swallow the capsule whole and do not crush, chew, break, or open it.</p><p>Take the capsule on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before eating. Taking a capsule while there is food in your stomach could destroy the capsule and make the vaccine ineffective.</p><p>Take each capsule according to the recommended schedule or this vaccine may not be effective. Plan ahead so that you complete all doses at least 1 week before you enter a typhoid risk area. The timing of this vaccination is very important for it to be effective.</p><p><b>You must keep typhoid vaccine capsules cold</b>. When you receive the capsules, place them in a refrigerator as soon as possible. Keep each capsule in the foil blister pack in the refrigerator until you are ready to take it. Do not allow the capsules to freeze.</p><p>This vaccine should be effective for up to 5 years. You may need to take another series of 4 capsules every 5 years if you continue to be exposed to typhoid. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Wash your hands often to help prevent typhoid when you are in an area where contamination is possible.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor if you forget to take a capsule on the scheduled day. You may need to start over to make sure you are fully protected against the disease.</p><p>Be sure to receive another series of 4 capsules every 5 years during continued exposure to typhoid.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur when taken as directed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after using typhoid vaccine?</h2><p>Avoid eating anything for at least 1 hour after you take a capsule.</p><p><b>Do not drink alcohol within 2 hours after you take a typhoid vaccine capsule.</b> Alcohol can damage the capsule and could make the vaccine ineffective.</p><p>In addition to using this vaccine, take precautions while traveling to further prevent coming into contact with bacteria that cause typhoid fever:</p><ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid eating raw fruits or vegetables that cannot be peeled, or that have been peeled by another person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid drinks that contain ice, or frozen treats and flavored ices that may have been made with contaminated water.</p>
