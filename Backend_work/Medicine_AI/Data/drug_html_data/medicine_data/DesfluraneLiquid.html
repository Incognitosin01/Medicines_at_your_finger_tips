</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Desflurane Liquid</h2><h3>Induction of Anesthesia</h3><p class="First">Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is indicated as an inhalation agent for induction of anesthesia for inpatient and outpatient surgery in adults.</p><p>Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is contraindicated as an inhalation agent for the induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients because of a high incidence of moderate to severe upper airway adverse events.</p><h3>Maintenance of Anesthesia</h3><p class="First">Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is indicated as an inhalation agent for maintenance of anesthesia for inpatient and outpatient surgery in adults and in pediatric patients.</p><p>After induction of anesthesia with agents other than Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation, and tracheal intubation, Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is indicated for maintenance of anesthesia in infants and children. Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is not approved for maintenance of anesthesia in non-intubated children due to an increased incidence of respiratory adverse reactions, including coughing, laryngospasm, and secretions <span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span> .</p><h2>Desflurane Liquid Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Only persons trained in the administration of general anesthesia should administer Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation. Only a vaporizer specifically designed and designated for use with desflurane should be utilized for its administration. Facilities for maintenance of a patent airway, artificial ventilation, oxygen enrichment, and circulatory resuscitation must be immediately available.</p><p>Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is administered by inhalation. The administration of general anesthesia must be individualized based on the patient’s response. Hypotension and respiratory depression increase as anesthesia with Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is deepened. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation decreases with increasing patient age. The MAC for Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is also reduced by concomitant N <span class="Sub">2</span>O administration <span class="Italics">(See Table 1)</span> . The dose should be adjusted accordingly. The following table provides mean relative potency based upon age and effect of N <span class="Sub">2</span>O in predominately ASA physical status I or II patients.</p><p>Benzodiazepines and opioids decrease the MAC of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.1, Table 3)]</span> . Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation also decreases the doses of neuromuscular blocking agents required <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.2, Table 4)]</span> .

In clinical studies, patients scheduled to be anesthetized with Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation frequently received IV preanesthetic medication, such as opioid and/or benzodiazepine.</p><h3>Induction</h3><p class="First">In adults, some premedicated with opioid, a frequent starting concentration was 3% Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation, increased in 0.5% to 1% increments every 2 to 3 breaths. End-tidal concentrations of 4% to 11%, Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation with and without N <span class="Sub">2</span>O, produced anesthesia within 2 minutes to 4 minutes. When Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation was tested as the primary anesthetic induction agent, the incidence of upper airway irritation (apnea, breathholding, laryngospasm, coughing and secretions) was high. During induction in adults, the overall incidence of oxyhemoglobin desaturation (SpO <span class="Sub">2</span> &lt; 90%) was 6% [ See Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p><p>After induction in adults with an intravenous drug such as thiopental or propofol, Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation can be started at approximately 0.5 to 1 MAC, whether the carrier gas is O <span class="Sub">2</span> or N <span class="Sub">2</span>O/O <span class="Sub">2</span>.</p><p>Inspired concentrations of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation greater than 12% have been safely administered to patients, particularly during induction of anesthesia. Such concentrations will proportionately dilute the concentration of oxygen; therefore, maintenance of an adequate concentration of oxygen may require a reduction of nitrous oxide or air if these gases are used concurrently.</p><h3>Maintenance</h3><p class="First">Surgical levels of anesthesia in adults may be maintained with concentrations of 2.5% to 8.5% Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation with or without the concomitant use of nitrous oxide. In children, surgical levels of anesthesia may be maintained with concentrations of 5.2% to 10% Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation with or without the concomitant use of nitrous oxide.</p><p>During the maintenance of anesthesia with inflow rates of 2 L/min or more, the alveolar concentration of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation will usually be within 10% of the inspired concentration <span class="Italics">[F <span class="Sub">A</span>/F <span class="Sub">I</span>,</span> <span class="Italics">see Figure 2 in Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><p>During the maintenance of anesthesia, increasing concentrations of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation produce dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Excessive decreases in blood pressure may be due to depth of anesthesia and in such instances may be corrected by decreasing the inspired concentration of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation.</p><p>Concentrations of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation exceeding 1 MAC may increase heart rate. Thus with this drug, an increased heart rate may not serve reliably as a sign of inadequate anesthesia.</p><h3>Maintenance of Anesthesia in Intubated Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is indicated for maintenance of anesthesia in infants and children after induction of anesthesia with agents other thanDesflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation, and tracheal intubation.</p><p>Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation, with or without N <span class="Sub">2</span>O, and halothane, with or without N <span class="Sub">2</span>O were studied in three clinical trials of pediatric patients aged 2 weeks to 12 years (median 2 years) and ASA physical status I or II. The concentration of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation required for maintenance of general anesthesia is age-dependent <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span> .</p><p>Changes in blood pressure during maintenance of and recovery from anesthesia with Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation/N <span class="Sub">2</span>O/O <span class="Sub">2</span> are similar to those observed with halothane/N <span class="Sub">2</span>O/O <span class="Sub">2</span>. Heart rate during maintenance of anesthesia is approximately 10 beats per minute faster with desflurane than with halothane. Patients were judged fit for discharge from post-anesthesia care units within one hour with both Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation and halothane. There were no differences in the incidence of nausea and vomiting between patients receiving Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation or halothane.</p><h3>Recovery</h3><p class="First">The recovery from general anesthesia should be assessed carefully before patients are discharged from the post anesthesia care unit (PACU).</p><h3>Use in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease</h3><p class="First">In patients with coronary artery disease, maintenance of normal hemodynamics is important to prevent myocardial ischemia. A rapid increase in desflurane concentration is associated with marked increase in pulse rate, mean arterial pressure and levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation should not be used as the sole agent for anesthetic induction in patients with coronary artery disease or patients where increases in heart rate or blood pressure are undesirable. It should be used with other medications, preferably intravenous opioids and hypnotics <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Neurosurgical Use</h3><p class="First">Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation may produce a dose-dependent increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) when administered to patients with intracranial space occupying lesions. Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation should be administered at 0.8 MAC or less, and in conjunction with a barbiturate induction and hyperventilation (hypocapnia) until cerebral decompression in patients with known or suspected increases in CSFP. Appropriate attention must be paid to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span> .</p><h3>Observations Related to Vaporizer Use</h3><p class="First">Yellow discoloration of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation sometimes accompanied by particulates, has been observed through the vaporizer sight glass or after draining the vaporizer. The presence of discoloration or particulates in these situations does not alter the quality or efficacy of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation. If observed, refer to the respective vaporizer Instructions For Use (IFU) for recommended actions or contact Sandoz Product Surveillance.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is a colorless, non-flammable, volatile liquid (below 22.8°C) for inhalation, 100% desflurane.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">The use of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation is contraindicated in the following conditions:</p><ul>
<li>Known or suspected genetic susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia.</li>
<li>Patients in whom general anesthesia is contraindicated.</li>
<li>Induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients.</li>
<li>Patients with known sensitivity to Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation or to other halogenated agents <span class="Italics">[See</span> Warnings and Precautions (5.6)<span class="Italics">]</span> .</li>
<li>Patients with a history of moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction following anesthesia with Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation or other halogenated agents and not otherwise explained <span class="Italics">[See</span> Warnings and Precautions (5.6)<span class="Italics">]</span> .</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Malignant Hyperthermia</h3><p class="First">In susceptible individuals, potent inhalation anesthetic agents may trigger a skeletal muscle hypermetabolic state leading to high oxygen demand and the clinical syndrome known as malignant hyperthermia. In genetically susceptible pigs, desflurane induced malignant hyperthermia. The clinical syndrome is signaled by hypercapnia, and may include muscle rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, and/or unstable blood pressure. Some of these nonspecific signs may also appear during light anesthesia: acute hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypovolemia.</p><p>Treatment of malignant hyperthermia includes discontinuation of triggering agents, administration of intravenous dantrolene sodium, and application of supportive therapy. (Consult prescribing information for dantrolene sodium intravenous for additional information on patient management.) Renal failure may appear later, and urine flow should be monitored and sustained if possible.</p><p>Fatal outcome of malignant hyperthermia has been reported with desflurane.</p><h3>Perioperative Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First">Use of inhaled anesthetic agents has been associated with rare increases in serum potassium levels that have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias and death in pediatric patients during the postoperative period. Patients with latent as well as overt neuromuscular disease, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy, appear to be most vulnerable. Concomitant use of succinylcholine has been associated with most, but not all, of these cases. These patients also experienced significant elevations in serum creatinine kinase levels and, in some cases, changes in urine consistent with myoglobinuria. Despite the similarity in presentation to malignant hyperthermia, none of these patients exhibited signs or symptoms of muscle rigidity or hypermetabolic state. Early and aggressive intervention to treat the hyperkalemia and resistant arrhythmias is recommended, as is subsequent evaluation for latent neuromuscular disease.</p><h3>Respiratory Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Desflurane is not approved for maintenance of anesthesia in non-intubated children due to an increased incidence of respiratory adverse reactions, including coughing, laryngospasm and secretions <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span> .</p><p>Children, particularly if 6 years old or younger, who are under an anesthetic maintenance of desflurane delivered via laryngeal mask airway (LMA™ mask) are at increased risk for adverse respiratory reactions, e.g., coughing and laryngospasm, especially with removal of the laryngeal mask airway under deep anesthesia <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span> . Therefore, closely monitor these patients for signs and symptoms associated with laryngospasm and treat accordingly.</p><p>When desflurane is used for maintenance of anesthesia in children with asthma or a history of recent upper airway infection, there is an increased risk for airway narrowing and increases in airway resistance. Therefore, closely monitor these patients for signs and symptoms associated with airway narrowing and treat accordingly <span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>QTc Prolongation</h3><p class="First">QTc prolongation, associated with torsade de pointes, has been reported [See Adverse Reactions ( 6.2)]. Carefully monitor cardiac rhythm when administering desflurane to susceptible patients (e.g., patients with congenital Long QT Syndrome or patients taking drugs that can prolong the QT interval).</p><h3>Interactions with Desiccated Carbon Dioxide Absorbents</h3><p class="First">Desflurane like some other inhalation anesthetics, can react with desiccated carbon dioxide (CO <span class="Sub">2</span>) absorbents to produce carbon monoxide that may result in elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin in some patients. Case reports suggest that barium hydroxide lime and soda lime become desiccated when fresh gases are passed through the CO <span class="Sub">2</span> canister at high flow rates over many hours or days. When a clinician suspects that CO <span class="Sub">2</span> absorbent may be desiccated, it should be replaced before the administration of desflurane.</p><h3>Hepatobiliary Disorders</h3><p class="First">With the use of halogenated anesthetics, disruption of hepatic function, icterus and fatal liver necrosis have been reported; such reactions appear to indicate hypersensitivity. As with other halogenated anesthetic agents, desflurane may cause sensitivity hepatitis in patients who have been sensitized by previous exposure to halogenated anesthetics <span class="Italics">[See Contraindications (4)]</span> . Cirrhosis, viral hepatitis or other pre-existing hepatic disease may be a reason to select an anesthetic other than a halogenated anesthetic. As with all halogenated anesthetics, repeated anesthesia within a short period of time should be approached with caution.</p><h3>Pediatric Neurotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans. <span class="Italics">[See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.4), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span> .</p><p>Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.</p><p>Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.</p><h3>Laboratory Findings</h3><p class="First">Transient elevations in glucose and white blood cell count may occur as with use of other anesthetic agents.</p><h3>Postoperative Agitation in Children</h3><p class="First">Emergence from anesthesia in children may evoke a brief state of agitation that may hinder cooperation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse event information is derived from controlled clinical trials, the majority of which were conducted in the United States. The studies were conducted using a variety of premedications, other anesthetics, and surgical procedures of varying length. Most adverse events reported were mild and transient, and may reflect the surgical procedures, patient characteristics (including disease) and/or medications administered.</p><p>Of the 2,143 patients exposed to desflurane in clinical trials, 370 adults and 152 children were induced with desflurane alone and 987 patients were maintained principally with desflurane. The frequencies given reflect the percent of patients with the event. Each patient was counted once for each type of adverse event.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p>Clinical Considerations</p><p>Labor or Delivery</p><p>The safety of desflurane during labor or delivery has not been demonstrated. Desflurane is a uterine-relaxant.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Pregnant rats were exposed to 8.2% desflurane (1 MAC; 60% oxygen) for 0.5, 1, or 4 hours (0.5, 1, or 4 MAC-hours) per day during organogenesis (Gestation Day 6 to 15).</p><p>Embryo-fetal toxicity (increased post-implantation loss and reduced viable fetuses) was noted in the 4 hour treatment group in the presence of maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain). There was no evidence of malformations in any group.</p><p>Pregnant rabbits were exposed to 8.9% desflurane (1 MAC; 60% oxygen) for 0.5, 1, or 3 hours per day during organogenesis (Gestation Days 6 to 18). Fetal toxicity (reduced viable fetuses) was noted in the 3 hour treatment group in the presence of maternal toxicity (reduced body weight). There was no evidence of malformations in any group.</p><p>Pregnant rats were exposed to 8.2% desflurane (1 MAC; 60% oxygen) for 0.5, 1, or 4 hours per day from late gestation and through lactation (Gestation Day 15 to Lactation Day 21). Pup body weights were reduced in the 4 hours per day group in the presence of maternal toxicity (increased mortality and reduced body weight gain). This study did not evaluate neurobehavioral function including learning and memory or reproductive behavior in the first generation (F1) pups.</p><p>In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus. In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring. With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear; however, studies in juvenile animals suggest neuroapoptosis correlates with long-term cognitive deficits <span class="Italics">[See </span>Warnings and Precautions (5.7)<span class="Italics">, Use in Specific Populations (8.4), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when desflurane is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Respiratory Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients</span></span></p><p>Desflurane is indicated for maintenance of anesthesia in infants and children after induction of anesthesia with agents other than desflurane, and tracheal intubation.</p><p>Is not approved for maintenance of anesthesia in non-intubated children due to an increased incidence of respiratory adverse reactions, including coughing (26%), laryngospasm (13%) and secretions (12%) <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span> .</p><p>Children, particularly if 6 years old or younger, who are under an anesthetic maintenance of desflurane delivered via laryngeal mask airway (LMA™ mask) are at increased risk for adverse respiratory reactions, e.g., coughing and laryngospasm, especially with removal of the laryngeal mask airway under deep anesthesia <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14.5)]</span> . Therefore, closely monitor these patients for signs and symptoms associated with laryngospasm and treat accordingly.</p><p>When desflurane is used for maintenance of anesthesia in children with asthma or a history of recent upper airway infection, there is an increased risk for airway narrowing and increases in airway resistance. Therefore, closely monitor these patients for signs and symptoms associated with airway narrowing and treat accordingly.</p><p>Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as desflurane, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.</p><p>In primates, exposure to 3 hours of ketamine that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer of isoflurane increased neuronal cell loss. Data from isoflurane-treated rodents and ketamine-treated primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women, neonates, and young children who require procedures with the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data <span class="Italics">[See</span> Warnings and Precautions (5.7)<span class="Italics">, Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane decreases with increasing patient age. The dose should be adjusted accordingly. The average MAC for desflurane in a 70 year old patient is two-thirds the MAC for a 20 year old patient <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2) Table 1 and Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Concentrations of 1% to 4% desflurane in nitrous oxide/oxygen have been used in patients with chronic renal or hepatic impairment and during renal transplantation surgery.</p><p>Because of minimal metabolism, a need for dose adjustment in patients with renal and hepatic impairment is not to be expected.</p><p>Nine patients receiving desflurane (N=9) were compared to 9 patients receiving isoflurane, all with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL to 6.9 mg/dL). No differences in hematological or biochemical tests, including renal function evaluation, were seen between the two groups. Similarly, no differences were found in a comparison of patients receiving either desflurane (N=28) or isoflurane (N=30) undergoing renal transplant.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Eight patients receiving desflurane were compared to six patients receiving isoflurane, all with chronic hepatic disease (viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, or cirrhosis). No differences in hematological or biochemical tests, including hepatic enzymes and hepatic function evaluation, were seen.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The symptoms of overdosage of desflurane can present as a deepening of anesthesia, cardiac and/or respiratory depression in spontaneously breathing patients, and cardiac depression in ventilated patients in whom hypercapnia and hypoxia may occur only at a late stage. In the event of overdosage, or suspected overdosage, take the following actions: discontinue administration of desflurane, maintain a patent airway, initiate assisted or controlled ventilation with oxygen, and maintain adequate cardiovascular function.</p><h2>Desflurane Liquid Description</h2><p class="First">Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation, a nonflammable liquid administered via vaporizer, is a general inhalation anesthetic.

Desflurane is a volatile liquid inhalation anesthetic minimally biotransformed in the liver in humans. Less than 0.02% of the desflurane absorbed can be recovered as urinary metabolites (compared to 0.2% for isoflurane). Eight healthy male volunteers first breathed 70% N <span class="Sub">2</span>O/30% O <span class="Sub">2</span> for 30 minutes and then a mixture of desflurane 2%, isoflurane 0.4%, and halothane 0.2% for another 30 minutes. During this time, inspired and end-tidal concentrations (F <span class="Sub">I</span> and F <span class="Sub">A</span>) were measured. The F <span class="Sub">A</span>/F <span class="Sub">I</span> (washin) value at 30 minutes for desflurane was 0.91, compared to 1.00 for N <span class="Sub">2</span>O, 0.74 for isoflurane, and 0.58 for halothane <span class="Italics">(See Figure 2)</span> .

Tests for genotoxicity included the Ames mutation assay, the metaphase analysis of human lymphocytes, and the mouse micronucleus assay.</p><p>Impairment of Fertility: In a study in which male animals were administered 8.2% desflurane (60% oxygen) for either 0.5, 1, or 4 hours per day beginning 63 days prior to mating and female animals were administered the same doses of desflurane for 14 days prior to mating through Lactation Day 21, there were no adverse effects on fertility in the 1 hour per day treatment group. However, reduced male and female fertility was noted in the 4 hour a day group. A dose dependent increase in mortality and decreased body weight gain was noted in all treatment groups.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Published studies in animals demonstrate that the use of anesthetic agents during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.</p><p>In primates, exposure to 3 hours of an anesthetic regimen that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer increased neuronal cell loss. Data in rodents and in primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with subtle but prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in neonates and young children who require procedures against the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data <span class="Italics">[See</span> Warnings and Precautions (5.7) <span class="Italics">and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.4)]</span> .</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of desflurane was evaluated in 1,843 patients including ambulatory (N=1,061), cardiovascular (N=277), geriatric (N=103), neurosurgical (N=40), and pediatric (N=235) patients. Clinical experience with these patients and with 1,087 control patients in these studies not receiving desflurane is described below. Although desflurane can be used in adults for the inhalation induction of anesthesia via mask, it produces a high incidence of respiratory irritation (coughing, breathholding, apnea, increased secretions, laryngospasm). Oxyhemoglobin saturation below 90% occurred in 6% of patients (from pooled data, N = 370 adults).</p><h3>Ambulatory Surgery</h3><p class="First">Desflurane plus N <span class="Sub">2</span>O was compared to isoflurane plus N <span class="Sub">2</span>O in multicenter studies (21 sites) of 792 ASA physical status I, II, or III patients aged 18 to 76 years (median 32).</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Induction</span></span></p><p>Anesthetic induction begun with thiopental and continued with desflurane was associated with a 7% incidence of oxyhemoglobin saturation of 90% or less (from pooled data, N = 307) compared with 5% in patients in whom anesthesia was induced with thiopental and isoflurane (from pooled data, N = 152).</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Maintenance &amp; Recovery</span></span></p><p>Desflurane with or without N <span class="Sub">2</span>O or other anesthetics was generally well tolerated.

In all patients except the desflurane vs. sufentanil study, the volatile anesthetics were supplemented with intravenous opioids, usually fentanyl. Blood pressure and heart rate were controlled by changes in concentration of the volatile anesthetics or opioids and cardiovascular drugs if necessary.

In the desflurane vs. sufentanil study, anesthetic induction with desflurane without opioids was associated with new transient ischemia in 14 patients vs. 0 in the sufentanil group. In the desflurane group, mean heart rate, arterial pressure, and pulmonary blood pressure increased and stroke volume decreased in contrast to no change in the sufentanil group. Cardiovascular drugs were used frequently in both groups: especially esmolol in the desflurane group (56% vs. 0%) and phenylephrine in the sufentanil group (43% vs. 27%). When 10 mcg/kg of fentanyl was used to supplement induction of anesthesia at one other center, continuous 2-lead ECG analysis showed a low incidence of myocardial ischemia and no difference between desflurane and isoflurane. If desflurane is to be used in patients with coronary artery disease, it should be used in combination with other medications for induction of anesthesia, preferably intravenous opioids and hypnotics.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Maintenance &amp; Recovery</span></span></p><p>In studies where desflurane or isoflurane anesthesia was supplemented with fentanyl, there were no differences in hemodynamic variables or the incidence of myocardial ischemia in the patients anesthetized with desflurane compared to those anesthetized with isoflurane.</p><p>During the precardiopulmonary bypass period, in the desflurane vs. sufentanil study where the desflurane patients received no intravenous opioid, more desflurane patients required cardiovascular adjuvants to control hemodynamics than the sufentanil patients. During this period, the incidence of ischemia detected by ECG or echocardiography was not statistically different between desflurane (18 of 99) and sufentanil (9 of 98) groups. However, the duration and severity of ECG-detected myocardial ischemia was significantly less in the desflurane group.

Each individual bottle is supplied in a carton of 6, NDC 0781-6172-86.</p><h3>Safety and Handling</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Occupational Caution</span></span></p><p>There is no specific work exposure limit established for Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation. However, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (NIOSH) recommends that no worker should be exposed at ceiling concentrations greater than 2 ppm of any halogenated anesthetic agent over a sampling period not to exceed one hour.</p><p>Principle routes of exposure include:</p><p>Skin contact – May cause skin irritation. In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Seek medical attention if irritation develops.</p><p>Eye contact – May cause eye irritation. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical attention if irritation develops.</p><p>Ingestion – No specific hazards other than therapeutic effects. Do NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If large quantities of this material are swallowed, seek medical attention immediately.</p><p>Inhalation – If individuals smell vapors, or experience dizziness or headaches, they should be moved to an area with fresh air. Individuals could also experience the following: Cardiovascular effects: may include fluctuations in heart rate, changes in blood pressure, chest pain. Respiratory effects: may include shortness of breath, bronchospasms, laryngospasms, respiratory depression. Gastrointestinal effects: may include nausea, upset stomach, loss of appetite. Nervous System effects: may include ataxia, tremor, disturbance of speech, lethargy, headache, dizziness, blurred vision.</p><p>The predicted effects of acute overexposure by inhalation of Desflurane, USP, Liquid for Inhalation include headache, dizziness or (in extreme cases) unconsciousness <span class="Italics">[See Overdosage (10)]</span> .</p><p>There are no documented adverse effects of chronic exposure to halogenated anesthetic vapors ( <span class="Bold">W</span>aste <span class="Bold">A</span>nesthetic <span class="Bold">G</span>ases or WAGs) in the workplace. Although results of some epidemiological studies suggest a link between exposure to halogenated anesthetics and increased health problems (particularly spontaneous abortion), the relationship is not conclusive. Since exposure to WAGs is one possible factor in the findings for these studies, operating room personnel, and pregnant women in particular, should minimize exposure. Precautions include adequate general ventilation in the operating room, the use of a well-designed and well-maintained scavenging system; work practices to minimize leaks and spills while the anesthetic agent is in use, and routine equipment maintenance to minimize leaks.</p><p>Consistent with clinical data, concentrations would need to reach 2% to 3% in inspired air before individuals would likely experience dizziness or other physiologic effects.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p class="First">Store at 20º to 25ºC (68º to 77ºF) <span class="Italics">[See USP Controlled Room Temperature]</span>.
