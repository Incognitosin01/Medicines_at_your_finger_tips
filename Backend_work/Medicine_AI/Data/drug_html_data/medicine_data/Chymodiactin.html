Before you receive chymopapain, you will be given an anesthetic (either a general anesthetic to put you to sleep or a local anesthetic).</p><p>Very rarely, use of chymopapain may cause serious side effects, including paralysis of the legs or death. Another dangerous side effect of chymopapain injection is a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This side effect occurs in less than 1% of the patients receiving the medicine, but it occurs more often in women than in men. Before receiving chymopapain, you should discuss its use, and the possibility of anaphylaxis or other serious side effects, with your doctor.</p><p>Chymopapain injections are given only in a hospital, usually in an operating room, by your surgeon.</p><p>This medicine was available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><p>The sale and distribution of chymopapain was discontinued in the US in January 27, 2003 .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Chymodiactin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
