<li>2 mcg/mL single-dose vial</li>
<li>5 mcg/mL single-dose vial</li>
<li>10 mcg/2 mL (5 mcg/mL) single-dose vial</li>
<li>10 mcg/2 mL (5 mcg/mL) multiple-dose vial</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Paricalcitol is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Vitamin D toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Known hypersensitivity to paricalcitol or any of the inactive ingredients in paricalcitol. Hypersensitivity adverse reactions have been reported [e.g., angioedema (including laryngeal edema) and urticaria] <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypercalcemia</h3><p class="First">Hypercalcemia may occur during paricalcitol treatment. Acute hypercalcemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention.</p><p>Hypercalcemia may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or other vitamin D compounds <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> In addition, high intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. Patients with a history of hypercalcemia prior to initiating therapy may be at increased risk for development of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol. In these circumstances, frequent serum calcium monitoring and paricalcitol dose adjustments may be required.</p><p>When initiating paricalcitol or adjusting paricalcitol dose, measure serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly). Once a maintenance dose has been established, measure serum calcium at least monthly<span class="Italics">.</span> If hypercalcemia occurs, reduce the dose or discontinue paricalcitol until serum calcium is normal <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]</span>.</p><p>Inform patients about the symptoms of elevated calcium (feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss) and instruct them to report new or worsening symptoms when they occur.</p><h3>Digitalis Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Paricalcitol can cause hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> which increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using paricalcitol concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Increase the frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of paricalcitol <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Adynamic Bone Disease</h3><p class="First">Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if intact PTH levels are suppressed by paricalcitol to abnormally low levels. Monitor intact PTH levels to avoid over suppression and adjust paricalcitol dose, if needed <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Adynamic Bone Disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Four placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies were conducted in 113 patients (51% male, 10% Caucasian, 81% African-American and 9% Hispanic, ranging in age from 18 to 90 years). Sixty-two patients were exposed to paricalcitol and the average dose at the end of treatment was 0.12 mcg/kg/dose with a mean number of 55 days of dosing across the studies. Discontinuation of therapy due to any adverse reaction occurred in 6.5% of patients treated with paricalcitol and 2.0% of patients treated with placebo. Adverse reactions occurring with greater frequency in the paricalcitol group and at a frequency of 2% or greater are presented in Table 3.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 2% of the paricalcitol treated patients in the above mentioned studies and in additional double-blind, active-controlled and open-label studies:</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:</span> Anemia, lymphadenopathy</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Disorders:</span> Arrhythmia, atrial flutter, irregular heart rate, cardiac arrest, chest discomfort, chest pain, edema peripheral</p><p><span class="Italics">Ear and Labyrinth Disorders</span>: Ear discomfort</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine Disorders:</span> Hypoparathyroidism</p><p><span class="Italics">Eye Disorders</span>: Conjunctivitis, glaucoma, ocular hyperemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders</span>: Abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, dysphagia, gastritis, intestinal ischemia, rectal hemorrhage</p><p><span class="Italics">General Disorders:</span> Asthenia, condition aggravated, fatigue, feeling abnormal, pain, swelling</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections:</span> Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, vaginal infection</p><p><span class="Italics">Injection site reactions:</span> Injection site extravasation, injection site pain</p><p><span class="Italics">Laboratory abnormalities:</span> Hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, prolonged bleeding time</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:</span> Decreased appetite, thirst, decreased weight</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:</span> Joint stiffness, muscle twitching, myalgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified:</span> Breast cancer</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders:</span> Cerebrovascular accident, dizziness, dysgeusia, headache, hypoesthesia, myoclonus, paresthesia, syncope, unresponsive to stimuli, gait disturbance</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders</span>: Agitation, confusional state, delirium, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive System and Breast Disorders</span>: Breast pain, erectile dysfunction</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> Cough, dyspnea, orthopnea, pulmonary edema, wheezing</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> Alopecia, blister, hirsutism, night sweats, rash pruritic, pruritus, skin burning sensation</p><p><span class="Italics">Vascular Disorders:</span> Hypertension, hypotension</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of paricalcitol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.<br/>
<br/>
Allergic reactions, such as rash, urticaria, and angioedema (including laryngeal edema) have been reported.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited data with paricalcitol in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 14 mcg (equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg), based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold"><br/>
Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the risk for maternal hypertension and preeclampsia, miscarriage, preterm delivery, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight infants.</p><p><span class="Bold"><br/>
Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1 or 3 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by intravenous injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3 or 20 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Infants exposed to paricalcitol through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for paricalcitol and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from paricalcitol or from the underlying maternal condition.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Clinical Considerations<br/></span><br/>
Infants exposed to paricalcitol through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, including seizures, vomiting, constipation and weight loss. Monitoring of serum calcium in the infant should be considered.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Data<br/></span><br/>
Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [<span class="Sup">3</span>H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [<span class="Sup">3</span>H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [<span class="Sup">3</span>H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups’ stomachs.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with CKD have been established in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older with CKD on dialysis. Use of paricalcitol in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 29 patients, 5 to 19 years of age, with CKD on hemodialysis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol have not been established in pediatric patients less than 5 years old.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of paricalcitol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were studied in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and were similar to that of patients with normal hepatic function. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic function.</p><p>Paricalcitol has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of paricalcitol may lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>The treatment of acute overdosage should consist of supportive measures and discontinuation of drug administration. Serum calcium levels should be measured until normal.</p><p>Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis.</p><h2>Paricalcitol Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Paricalcitol USP, is a synthetically manufactured active vitamin D analog. It is a white to almost white powder chemically designated as 19-nor-1α,3β,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E),22(E)-triene and has the following structural formula:<br/>
<br/>
Molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">27</span>H<span class="Sub">44</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>.                       Molecular weight is 416.64.<br/>
<br/>
Paricalcitol Injection, USP is a sterile, clear, colorless, aqueous solution for intravenous use. Each mL contains paricalcitol, 2 mcg or 5 mcg and the following inactive ingredients: alcohol, 20% (v/v) and propylene glycol, 30% (v/v).</p><h2>Paricalcitol Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D<span class="Sub">2</span>  analog. Preclinical and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol’s biological actions are mediated through binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce PTH levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Within two hours after administering paricalcitol intravenous doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.24 mcg/kg, concentrations of paricalcitol decreased rapidly; thereafter, concentrations of paricalcitol declined log-linearly. No accumulation of paricalcitol was observed with three times a week dosing.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Distribution<br/></span><br/>
Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (≥99.8%). In healthy subjects, the steady state volume of distribution is approximately 23.8 L. The mean volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 5 subjects requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) is between 31 and 35 L.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Elimination<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Metabolism<br/></span><br/>
After intravenous administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of <span class="Sup">3</span>H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces and no parent drug found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat model of PTH suppression.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation (present at low levels in plasma), as well as 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Paricalcitol is excreted primarily by hepatobiliary excretion. Approximately 63% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the feces and 19% was recovered in the urine in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is about five to seven hours over the studied dose range of 0.04 to 0.16 mcg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol after administration of 0.24 mcg/kg paricalcitol IV bolus dose in CKD HD and PD patients is 13.9 and 15.4 hours, respectively (Table 5).</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric and pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were gender independent.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n=5) and moderate (n=5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n=10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol were similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol have been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis procedure has essentially no effect on paricalcitol elimination. However, compared to healthy subjects, CKD patients on dialysis showed a decreased CL and increased half-life.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL) (approximately 20-fold greater than that obtained after highest tested dose). In fresh primary cultured hepatocytes, the induction observed at paricalcitol concentrations up to 50 nM was less than two-fold for CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A, where the positive controls rendered a six- to nineteen-fold induction. Hence, paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.</p><p>Drug interactions with Paricalcitol Injection have not been studied. The following studies have been performed with oral paricalcitol capsules.</p><p><span class="Italics">Omeprazole</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetic interaction between paricalcitol capsule (16 mcg) and omeprazole (40 mg; oral), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were unaffected when omeprazole was administrated approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Strong CYP3A Inhibitors</span></p><p>Ketoconazole</p><p>The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days, on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol capsule has been studied in healthy subjects. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg administered 3 times per week (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg.<br/>
<br/>
In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg administered 3 times per week (at less than clinical exposure to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol.<br/>
<br/>
Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay.<br/>
<br/>
Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (13 times a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Studies in CKD on Dialysis</span></p><p>Three 12-week, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 78 patients with CKD on hemodialysis. In these studies, patients ranged in age from 22 to 90 years, 51% were males, 13% were Caucasian, 79% were African-American, and 8% were Hispanic. The most common causes of renal failure were hypertension and diabetes. The dose of paricalcitol was started at 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week intravenously. The dose was increased by 0.04 mcg/kg every 2 weeks until intact PTH levels were decreased at least 30% from baseline or a fifth escalation brought the dose to 0.24 mcg/kg, or intact PTH fell to less than 100 pg/mL, or the Ca × P product was greater than 75 within any 2 week period, or serum calcium became greater than 11.5 mg/dL at any time.</p><p>Patients treated with paricalcitol achieved a mean intact PTH reduction of 30% within 6 weeks. The results from these studies are as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Study in CKD on Dialysis</span></p><p>Paricalcitol was evaluated in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 29 pediatric patients, aged 5 to 19 years, with CKD on hemodialysis; nearly all had received some form of vitamin D prior to the study. Of the 29 patients, 76% were male, 52% were Caucasian and 45% were African-American. The initial dose of paricalcitol was 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week, based on baseline intact PTH level of less than 500 pg/mL, or 0.08 mcg/kg 3 times per week, based on baseline intact PTH level of 500 pg/mL or greater. The dose of paricalcitol was adjusted in 0.04 mcg/kg increments based on the levels of serum intact PTH, calcium and Ca × P. The mean baseline levels of intact PTH were 841 pg/mL for the 15 paricalcitol-treated patients and 740 pg/mL for the 14 placebo-treated patients. The mean dose of paricalcitol administered was 4.6 mcg (range: 0.8 mcg to 9.6 mcg). Sixty-seven percent of the paricalcitol-treated patients and 14% of the placebo-treated patients completed the trial. Seventy-one percent of the placebo-treated patients discontinued due to excessive elevations in intact PTH levels, as defined by 2 consecutive intact PTH levels greater than 700 pg/mL and greater than baseline after 4 weeks of treatment.</p><p>The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated that 60% of paricalcitol-treated patients and 21% of placebo-treated patients achieved two consecutive greater than or equal to 30% reductions from baseline in intact PTH.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Paricalcitol Injection, USP is a sterile, clear, colorless, aqueous solution free from visible particles and is supplied as follows:<br/>
