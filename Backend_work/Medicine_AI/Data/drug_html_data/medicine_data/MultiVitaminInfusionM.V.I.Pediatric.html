</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Multi Vitamin Infusion M.V.I. Pediatric</h2><p class="First">M.V.I. Pediatric is a combination of vitamins indicated for the prevention of vitamin deficiency in pediatric patients up to 11 years of age receiving parenteral nutrition.</p><p>The physician should not await the development of clinical signs of vitamin deficiency before initiating vitamin therapy.</p><h2>Multi Vitamin Infusion M.V.I. Pediatric Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Pediatric is a combination product that contains the following vitamins: ascorbic acid, vitamin A, vitamin D, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, dexpanthenol, vitamin E, vitamin K, folic acid, biotin, and vitamin B12 <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p>M.V.I. Pediatric is supplied as a single-dose vial of lyophilized powder for reconstitution and intended for administration by intravenous infusion after dilution.</p><p>Do not administer M.V.I. Pediatric as a direct, undiluted intravenous injection as it may cause dizziness, faintness and tissue irritation.</p><h3>Dosage Information</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>The recommended daily dosage volume of 1.5 mL, 3.25 mL, or 5 mL of the reconstituted solution is based on the patient's actual weight of less than 1 kg, 1 kg to less than 3 kg, and more than or equal to 3 kg, respectively (see Table 1).</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>One daily dose of the reconstituted solution (1.5 mL, 3.25 mL or 5 mL) is then added directly to the intravenous fluid <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].</span></li>
<li>Patients with multiple vitamin deficiencies or with increased vitamin requirements may need multiple daily dosages as indicated or additional doses of individual vitamins. However, additional daily dosages in infants are not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span> Supplemental vitamin A may be required for low-birth weight infants.</li>
</ul><h3>Preparation and Administration Instructions</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>M.V.I Pediatric is to be reconstituted and diluted only in a suitable work area such as a laminar flow hood (or an equivalent clean air compounding area).</li>
<li>Reconstitue the single-dose vial of M.V.I. Pediatric by adding 5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP, or Dextrose Injection USP 5%, or Sodium Chloride Injection USP to the 10 mL vial.</li>
<li>Swirl the vial gently after the addition of the diluent to hasten reconstitution. The reconstituted solution is ready within three minutes for use.</li>
<li>Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.</li>
<li>Once reconstituted, immediately withdraw the dose to be added to the appropriate intravenous fluids <span class="Italics">[see Dosage Information (2.2)]</span> and discard any unused portion. After reconstitution, complete withdrawal of vial contents within 4 hours. The reconstituted solution may be refrigerated and stored for up to 4 hours.</li>
<li>After M.V.I. Pediatric is diluted in an intravenous infusion, refrigerate the resulting solution unless it is to be used immediately, and use the solution within 24 hours after dilution.</li>
<li>Minimize exposure to light because some of the vitamins in M.V.I.Pediatric, particularly A, D and riboflavin, are light sensitive.</li>
</ul><h3>Monitoring Vitamin Blood Levels</h3><p class="First">Monitor blood vitamin concentrations to ensure maintenance of adequate levels, particularly in patients receiving parenteral multivitamins as the only source of vitamins for long periods of time.</p><h3>Drug Incompatibilities</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>M.V.I. Pediatric is not physically compatible with alkaline solutions such as a sodium bicarbonate solution and other alkaline drugs such as acetazolamide sodium, aminophylline, ampicillin sodium, tetracycline HCl and chlorothiazide sodium.</li>
<li>Folic acid is unstable in the presence of calcium salts such as calcium gluconate.</li>
<li>Vitamin A and thiamine in M.V.I. Pediatric may react with bisulfite solutions such as sodium bisulfite or vitamin K bisulfite.</li>
<li>Do not add M.V.I. Pediatric directly to intravenous fat emulsions.</li>
<li>Consult appropriate references for listings of physical and chemical compatibility of solutions and drugs with M.V.I. Pediatric. In such circumstances, admixture or Y-site administration with M.V.I. Pediatrc should be avoided.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">M.V.I. Pediatric for injection is available as a single-dose vial of yellow to amber colored lyophilized powder for reconstitution.</p><p>See Description section for vitamin strengths <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">M.V.I. Pediatric is contraindicated in patients who have:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>A history of known hypersensitivity to any of the vitamins or excipients in M.V.I. Pediatric <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6)]</span></li>
<li>An existing hypervitaminosis</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Aluminum Toxicity</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Pediatric contains aluminum, up to 42 mcg/L that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.</p><p>Patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 micrograms per kg per day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. To prevent aluminum toxicity, periodically monitor aluminum levels with prolonged parenteral administration of M.V.I. Pediatric.</p><h3>Allergic Reactions to Thiamine</h3><p class="First">Allergic reactions such as urticaria, shortness of breath, wheezing and angioedema have been reported following intravenous administration of thiamine, an ingredient in M.V.I. Pediatric. There have been rare reports of anaphylaxis following intravenous doses of thiamine. No fatal anaphylaxis reactions associated with M.V.I. Pediatric have been reported.</p><h3>Hypervitaminosis A</h3><p class="First">Hypervitaminosis A, manifested by nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and blurred vision, has been reported in patients with renal failure receiving 1.5 mg per day retinol and in patients with liver disease. Therefore, supplementation of patients with renal failure and patients with liver diseases with vitamin A, an ingredient found in M.V.I. Pediatric, should be undertaken with caution [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)</span>]. Blood levels of Vitamin A should be monitored periodically.</p><h3>Decreased Anticoagulant Effect of Warfarin</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Pediatric contains Vitamin K, which may decrease the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. In patients who are on warfarin anticoagulant therapy receiving M.V.I. Pediatric, prothrombin time/INR should be periodically monitored to determine if the dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted.</p><h3>Interference with Diagnosis of Megaloblastic Anemia</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Pediatric contains folic acid and cyanocobalamin, which can mask serum deficits of folic acid and cyanocobalamin in patients with megaloblastic anemia. Avoid the use of M.V.I. Pediatric in patients with suspected or diagnosed megaloblastic anemia prior to blood sampling for the detection of the folic acid and cyanocobalamin deficiencies.</p><h3>Potential to Develop Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses</h3><p class="First">In patients receiving parenteral multivitamins, such as with M.V.I. Pediatric, blood vitamin concentrations should be periodically monitored to determine if vitamin deficiencies or excesses are developing. M.V.I. Pediatric may not correct long-standing specific vitamin deficiencies. The administration of additional doses of specific vitamins may be required [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><h3>Interference with Urine Glucose Testing</h3><p class="First">M.V.I. Pediatric contains Vitamin C, which is also known as ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid in the urine may cause false negative urine glucose determinations.</p><h3>Vitamin E Overdose in Infants Receiving Additional Vitamin E</h3><p class="First">Additional vitamin E supplementation of patients receiving M.V.I Pediatric may result in elevated blood concentrations of vitamin E and potential vitamin E toxicity in infants. Avoid additional oral or parenteral doses of vitamin E in infants. A daily dose of M.V.I. Pediatric contains adequate concentrations of vitamin E required to achieve normal blood levels of vitamin E.</p><h3>Risk of Low Vitamin A Levels</h3><p class="First">Vitamin A may adhere to plastic, resulting in lower vitamin A concentrations after administration of M.V.I. Pediatric. Therefore, blood vitamin A concentrations should be periodically monitored and the administration of additional therapeutic doses of Vitamin A may be required, especially in low birth weight infants.</p><h3>Risk of E-Ferol syndrome</h3><p class="First">E-Ferol syndrome, manifested by thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, hepatomegaly, cholestasis, ascites, hypotension and metabolic acidosis, has been reported in low-birth weight infants following administration of polysorbates, which are found in M.V.I. Pediatric. No E-Ferol syndrome associated with M.V.I. Pediatric has been reported.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Allergic Reactions to Thiamine [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</li>
<li>Hypervitaminosis A [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>].</li>
</ul><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of M.V.I. Pediatric. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Allergic</span>: anaphylaxis, urticaria, shortness of breath, wheezing, angioedema</p><p><span class="Italics">CNS</span>: headache, dizziness, agitation, anxiety</p><p><span class="Italics">Dermatologic</span>: rash, erythema, pruritus</p><p><span class="Italics">Ophthalmic</span>: diplopia</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Effect of M.V.I. Pediatric on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Warfarin:</span> Vitamin K, a component of M.V.I. Pediatric, antagonizes the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are co-administered warfarin and M.V.I. Pediatric, monitor blood levels of prothrombin/INR periodically to determine if the dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Phenytoin:</span> Folic acid may increase phenytoin metabolism and lower the serum concentration of phenytoin, resulting in increased seizure frequency.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Methotrexate:</span> Folic acid may decrease a patient's response to methotrexate therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levodopa:</span> Pyridoxine may increase the metabolism of levodopa (decrease blood level of levodopa) and decrease its efficacy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antibiotics:</span> Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease antibiotic activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Bleomycin:</span> Ascorbic acid and riboflavin inactivate bleomycin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, thus the activity of bleomycin may be reduced.</p><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on M.V.I. Pediatric</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hydralazine or Isoniazid:</span> Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Chloramphenicol:</span> In patients with pernicious anemia, the hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy may be inhibited by concomitant administration of chloramphenicol.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Phenytoin:</span> Phenytoin may decrease serum folic acid concentrations.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of M.V.I.
