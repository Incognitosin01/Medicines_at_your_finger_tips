Exposure to temperatures above 25°C/77°F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period.</p><p>——————————————————————</p><p>™Normosol −−multiple electrolyte solutions, ICU Medical, Inc.</p><h2>Normosol-M and Dextrose - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">When administered intravenously, Normosol-M and 5% Dextrose Injection provides water and electrolytes (with dextrose as a readily available source of carbohydrate) for maintenance of daily fluid and electrolyte requirements, plus minimal carbohydrate calories. The electrolyte composition approaches that of the principal ions of normal plasma (extracellular fluid). The electrolyte concentration is hypotonic (112 mOsmol/liter) in relation to the extracellular fluid (280 mOsmol/liter). One liter provides approximately one-third of the average adult daily requirement for water and principal electrolytes in balanced proportions, with acetate as a bicarbonate alternate, plus 170 calories from dextrose.</p><p>Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and supply calories. Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein-sparing action. Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide in water.</p><p>Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na<span class="Sup">+</span>) and chloride (Cl<span class="Sup">−</span>) ions. Sodium (Na<span class="Sup">+</span>) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl<span class="Sup">−</span>) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na<span class="Sup">+</span>) and chloride (Cl<span class="Sup">−</span>) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.</p><p>Potassium acetate in water dissociates to provide potassium (K<span class="Sup">+</span>) and acetate (CH<span class="Sub">3</span>COO<span class="Sup">−</span>) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter) in a healthy adult and child over 10 days old; 3.5 to 6.0 mEq/liter in a child less than 10 days old. Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance. Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.</p><p>Magnesium acetate in water dissociates to provide magnesium (Mg<span class="Sup">++</span>) and acetate (CH<span class="Sub">3</span>COO<span class="Sup">−</span>) ions. Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0 mEq per liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.</p><p>Acetate anion (CH<span class="Sub">3</span>COO<span class="Sup">−</span>), a source of hydrogen ion acceptors, serves as an alternate source of bicarbonate (HCO<span class="Sub">3</span><span class="Sup">−</span>) by metabolic conversion in the liver. This has been shown to proceed readily even in the presence of severe liver disease. Thus, acetate anion exerts a mild systemic antiacidotic action that may be advantageous during fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy.</p><p>Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production). Average normal pediatric daily requirements are based on the child’s weight as described in the table below:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Weight</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Emphasis">Fluid Requirements</span></span></p><p class="First">Up to 10 kg</p><p class="First">100 mL/kg</p><p class="First">11 to 20 kg</p><p class="First">1,000 mL + 50 mL/kg for each kg above 10 kg</p><p class="First">Above 20 kg</p><p class="First">1,500 mL + 20 mL/kg for each kg above 20 kg</p><p>Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na<span class="Sup">+</span>) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Normosol-M and Dextrose</h2><p class="First">Normosol-M and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and 5% Dextrose Injection Type 1, USP) is indicated for parenteral maintenance of routine daily fluid and electrolyte requirements with minimal carbohydrate calories from dextrose. Magnesium in the formula may help to prevent iatrogenic magnesium deficiency in patients receiving prolonged parenteral therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None known.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention.</p><p>Solutions which contain potassium should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present.</p><p>In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention.</p><p>Solutions containing acetate should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis, and in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of acetate, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>Administration of this solution can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.</p><p>Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.</p><p>Solutions containing acetate should be used with caution, as excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.</p><p>Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion.</p><p>In very low birth weight infants, excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible intracerebral hemorrhage.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C.</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Normosol-M and 5% Dextrose Injection. It is also not known whether this solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. This solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Pediatric Use.</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations. In neonates and very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance.</p><p>Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.</p><p>If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of overhydration or solute overload, re-evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures.
