Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish and certain water-borne organisms on which they feed. Do not permit water runoff from feedlots to enter lakes, streams or ground water. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by the improper disposal of drug containers. Spills should be contained and soaked up with absorbent towels or into loose soil. Gloves should be worn to prevent skin exposure. All the collected materials (contaminated towels and soil), as well as all empty drug containers should be placed in an impervious film (plastic) bag and disposed of by incineration or in an approved landfill.</p><h2>STORAGE INFORMATION</h2><p class="First">Store at 68° – 77° F (20° – 25° C).
