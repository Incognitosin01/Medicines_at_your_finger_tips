In traditional Chinese medicine, luo han guo has been used as a pulmonary demulcent and emollient for the treatment of dry cough, sore throat, and extreme thirst. However, there are no clinical trials to support these uses.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>Limited clinical data are available regarding use in humans.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications have not yet been identified.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Potential adverse effects are unknown.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>No definitive information is available regarding toxicity of luo han guo fruit.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Cucurbitaceae</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>Luo han guo is the fruit of S. grosvenori, a perennial, herbaceous, dioecious climbing vine that grows 2 to 5 m in length using tendrils.</p><p>The roots of the plant are large and fusiform or subglobose.Swingle 1941 The leaves of the plant are heart-shaped (10 to 20 cm length) and the fruit is round (5 to 7 cm diameter), smooth, and yellow-brown or green-brown in color. The seeds are numerous, pale yellow, broadly ovate, and compressed. The female inflorescence is in the form of axillary clusters; the male inflorescence is racemose.Swingle 1941 The plant is native to southern China in the provinces of Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, and in Northern Thailand.Swingle 1941 A synonym is Momordicaceae.</p><h2>History</h2><p>The name luo han guo or "monk fruit" might be derived from the belief that Buddhist monks were among the first people to cultivate this fruit; in Chinese culture, monk fruit is also associated with the saints that surround Buddha.Hossen 2005, Swingle 1941, Tsang 2001 The skin, flesh, and seeds of monk fruit are sweet and possess a unique taste. The fruit is usually boiled or simmered in water and consumed as an herbal tea or used in preparation of soups and stews.Swingle 1941 The fruit is traditionally associated with abundant health, and its uses as food by Asian populations in many parts of the world and in traditional Chinese medicine are well documented in Chinese historical literature.Swingle 1941 The original botanical name S. grosvenori was published in 1941 in honor of Gilbert Grosvenor who, as president of the National Geographic Society, helped fund an expedition in the 1930s to find the living plant where it was cultivated.Swingle 1941</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>The penta-, tetra-, and triglucose conjugated mogrosides are the sweetening components of luo han guo; the main mogrosides include mogroside V, mogroside IV, siamenoside I, and neomogroside.Chen 2005, Hussain 1990, Kinghorn 1987, Makapugay 1985, Tsang 2001 The siraitic acids A, B, C, D, and E, which are structurally 28-norcucurbitacins, are isolated from S. grosvenori.Chen 2005</p><p>Momorgrosvin is a ribosome inactivating protein also isolated from S. grosvenori.Tsang 2001</p><p>In 2009, several new chemical components were isolated from this plant. Siraitiflavandiol is a new bioactive compound of the flavandiols class that has demonstrated in vitro inhibitory activity against oral bacterial species, such as Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans.Zheng 2009</p><p>Siraitic acid IIB is a saponin that has demonstrated antitumor activity in vitro against lung cancer cells A-549 and liver cancer cells Hep-G2. Siraitic acid IIC has inhibited liver cancer cells Hep-G2.Li 2009</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>In Chinese folk medicine, S. grosvenori has been used for cough, sputum, asthma, bronchitis, pharyngitis, obesity, acute gastritis, and constipation. In traditional Chinese medicine, luo han guo has been used as a pulmonary demulcent and emollient for the treatment of dry cough, sore throat, and extreme thirst. It is also used as a plant-derived substitute for sucrose. The fruit is generally sold in dry form and is used in herbal teas and soups. Previous studies have revealed antiatherosclerotic effects and anticancer, antiallergy, and antidiabetic activity.Murata 2010</p><h3>Animal data</h3><p>S. grosvenori has shown antihyperglycemic effects in rats via inhibition of maltase. It has also shown antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties.Suzuki 2005 Polysaccharides from S. grosvenori promoted the proliferation of spleen cells and regulated the level of reactive oxygen species in vitro. It also raised superoxidase dismutase activity and regulated the cytokine levels of spleen and thymus in mice in vivo.Zhang 2011</p><p>S. grosvenori has antineoplastic activity related to the norcucurbitacins isolated from the plant. Siraitic acids IIB and IIC have shown antitumor effects in several lung and liver cancer cell lines.Li 2009 The extract has also been reported to have suppressive effects on dicyclanil-promoted hepatocellular proliferative lesions in mice models.Matsumoto 2009 Several studies have indicated anticancer effects, such as inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus activation and delayed development of papillomas in skin carcinogenesis models.Ukiya 2002 Improved glucose, lipid utility, and increased insulin sensitivity were observed as a possible result of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation by crude mogrosides isolated from the fruit of S. grosvenori in several diabetic rodent models.Chen 2011</p><p>S. grosvenori has demonstrated an antifatigue effect on mice that is dose dependent.Liu 2013</p><p>A 28-day dietary study of <i>PureLo</i>, a noncaloric sweetener that is a dried concentrate of luo han guo, was conducted in mice at dose levels ranging from 0 to 100,000 ppm and resulted in no associated toxicity.Marone 2008</p><h3>Clinical data</h3><p>Limited clinical data are available regarding use in humans.</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Limited clinical data are available regarding use in humans. However, the fruit is consumed in normal amounts in the form of herbal teas or soups. The intended use of the sweetener <i>PureLo</i> is at a fraction of 1%, far lower than the 10% that constituted the highest level tested, and research with <i>PureLo</i> has shown it is aversive to humans at extremely high concentrations.Marone 2008</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Several toxicity studies have been performed with the dried fruit concentrate in mice and dogs. These studies did not reveal any adverse reactions or toxicity with dietary use of luo han guo.Marone 2006</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>No data available.</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li>Momordicaceae</li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
