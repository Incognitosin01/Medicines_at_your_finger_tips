<html><head></head><body><h1>Gadoteridol (Intravenous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> gadoteridol (gad-oh-TER-i-dol)</p><p>Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired elimination of the drugs (ie, chronic, severe renal insufficiency (GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), or acute kidney injury. Avoid use of GBCAs unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating systemic fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle, and internal organs. Screen all patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (eg, age greater than 60 years, hypertension, or diabetes), perform lab testing to estimate the GFR. For patients with the highest NSF risk, do not exceed recommended dose and allow a sufficient time period for elimination prior to readministration .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

MRI scans use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas of the body. Unlike x-rays, MRI scans do not involve radiation. Gadoteridol is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is given by injection before an MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, head, or neck.</p><p>Gadoteridol is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using gadoteridol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For gadoteridol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to gadoteridol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadoteridol injection in children 2 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of gadoteridol injection in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of gadoteridol. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Anemia or</li>
<li>Asthma or allergies, history of or</li>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure) or</li>
<li>Sickle cell anemia—Use with caution. May increase risk for side effects.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney problems, severe, or history of or</li>
<li>Liver disease, history of or</li>
<li>Seizures (grand mal), history of—Use with caution. May cause side effects to become worse.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of gadoteridol</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child gadoteridol. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins just before you have an MRI scan.</p><p>Gadoteridol comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using gadoteridol</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress while you are receiving gadoteridol and during the MRI scan</i> to make sure gadoteridol is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have burning or itching of the skin, deep bone pain in the hips or ribs, joint stiffness, a limited range of motion in the arms and legs, muscle weakness, red or dark patches on the skin of the arms or legs, or skin swelling, hardening, or tightening within the first few days or weeks after you receive gadoteridol. These may be symptoms of a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).</p><p>Gadoteridol may increase your risk of having acute kidney injury (AKI). This has occurred in patients with severe kidney problems, and the risk is increased with high doses of gadoteridol.</p><p>Gadoteridol may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have chest pain, cold, clammy skin, confusion, dizziness, lightheadedness, a skin rash, itching, sweating, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, or trouble breathing after receiving the medicine.</p><p>Gadoteridol contains a metal called gadolinium, which can stay in your body (including the brain, bones, skin) for a long time (several months to years). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Gadoteridol side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
