</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Memantine and Donepezil Capsules</h2><p class="First">Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer’s type in patients stabilized on 10 mg of donepezil hydrochloride once daily.</p><h2>Memantine and Donepezil Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosing</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules is 28 mg/10 mg once daily.</p><p><span class="Italics">For patients stabilized on donepezil and not currently on memantine:</span></p><p>For patients stabilized on donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg and not currently on memantine hydrochloride, the recommended starting dose of memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules is 7 mg/10 mg, taken once a day in the evening. The dose should be increased in 7 mg increments of the memantine hydrochloride component to the recommended maintenance dose of 28 mg/10 mg once daily. The minimum recommended interval between dose increases is one week. The dose should only be increased if the previous dose has been well tolerated. The maximum dose is 28 mg/10 mg once daily.</p><p><span class="Italics">For patients stabilized on both donepezil and memantine:</span></p><p>Patients stabilized on memantine hydrochloride (10 mg twice daily or 28 mg extended-release once daily) and donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg once daily can be switched to memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules 28 mg/10 mg, taken once a day in the evening. Patients should start memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules the day following the last dose of memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release administered separately.</p><p>If a patient misses a single dose of memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, the next dose should be taken as scheduled, without doubling up the dose.</p><h3>Administration Information</h3><p class="First">Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules can be taken with or without food. Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules can be taken intact or may be opened, sprinkled on applesauce, and swallowed without chewing. The entire contents of each memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsule should be consumed; the dose should not be divided.</p><p>Except when opened and sprinkled on applesauce, as described above, memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules should be swallowed whole. Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules should not be divided, chewed, or crushed.</p><h3>Dosing in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">For patients stabilized on donepezil and not currently on memantine:</span></p><p>For patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min, based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation), stabilized on donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg once daily and not currently on memantine hydrochloride, the recommended starting dose of memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules is 14 mg/10 mg taken once a day in the evening. The dose should be increased to the recommended maintenance dose of 14 mg/10 mg once daily in the evening after a minimum of one week <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">For patients stabilized on both donepezil and memantine:</span></p><p>Patients with severe renal impairment, stabilized on memantine hydrochloride (5 mg twice daily or 14 mg extended-release once daily) and donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg once daily, can be switched to memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules 14 mg/10 mg, taken once daily in the evening.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to memantine hydrochloride, donepezil hydrochloride, piperidine derivatives, or to any excipients used in the formulation.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Anesthesia</h3><p class="First">Donepezil hydrochloride, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. </p><h3>Cardiovascular Conditions</h3><p class="First">Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules.</p><h3>Peptic Ulcer Disease and Gastrointestinal Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients treated with memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</p><h3>Nausea and Vomiting</h3><p class="First">Donepezil hydrochloride, when initiated, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Genitourinary Conditions</h3><p class="First">Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction.</p><p>Conditions that raise urine pH may decrease the urinary elimination of memantine, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, resulting in increased plasma levels of memantine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Cholinomimetics, including donepezil hydrochloride, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h3>Pulmonary Conditions</h3><p class="First">Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling.</p><ul class="Disc">

Therefore,</p><p>alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the</p><p>drug with a possible increase in adverse reactions. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g., renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions.</p><h3>Use of Memantine with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists</h3><p class="First">The combined use of memantine hydrochloride with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution.</p><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Donepezil</h3><p class="First">Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) and CYP2D6 (e.g., quinidine), inhibit donepezil metabolism <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Whether there is a clinical effect of quinidine is not known. Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of elimination of donepezil.</p><h3>Use of Donepezil with Anticholinergics</h3><p class="First">Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil hydrochloride, have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications.</p><h3>Use of Donepezil with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">A synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors, including donepezil hydrochloride, are given concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking agents, or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules or its active ingredients (memantine hydrochloride and donepezil hydrochloride) in pregnant women.</p><p>Adverse developmental effects (mortality and decreased body weight and skeletal ossification) were observed in the offspring of rats administered memantine or donepezil during pregnancy at doses associated with minimal maternal toxicity.

No specific antidote for memantine hydrochloride overdose is known; however, elimination of memantine can be increased by acidification of the urine. Tertiary anticholinergics such as atropine may be used as an antidote for donepezil hydrochloride overdose. In managing cases of overdose, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. In case of overdose, call Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for the latest recommendation. In general, supportive measures should be utilized, and treatment should be symptomatic.</p><p><span class="Bold">Memantine Hydrochloride</span></p><p>Signs and symptoms most often accompanying overdosage with other formulations of memantine in clinical trials and from worldwide marketing experience, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, include agitation, asthenia, bradycardia, confusion, coma, dizziness, ECG changes, increased blood pressure, lethargy, loss of consciousness, psychosis, restlessness, slowed movement, somnolence, stupor, unsteady gait, visual hallucinations, vertigo, vomiting, and weakness. The largest known ingestion of memantine worldwide was 2 grams in an individual who took memantine in conjunction with unspecified antidiabetic medications. This person experienced coma, diplopia, and agitation, but subsequently recovered.</p><p>One patient participating in a memantine hydrochloride extended-release clinical trial unintentionally took 112 mg of memantine hydrochloride extended-release daily for 31 days and experienced an elevated serum uric acid, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, and low platelet count.</p><p>No fatalities have been noted with overdoses of memantine alone. A fatal outcome has very rarely been reported when memantine has been ingested as part of overdosing with multiple drugs; in those instances, the relationship between memantine and a fatal outcome has been unclear.</p><p><span class="Bold">Donepezil Hydrochloride</span></p><p>Overdosage with cholinesterase inhibitors can result in cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved. Tertiary anticholinergics such as atropine may be used as an antidote for donepezil hydrochloride overdosage. Intravenous atropine sulfate titrated to effect is recommended: an initial dose of 1 to 2 mg IV with subsequent doses based upon clinical response. Atypical responses in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported with other cholinomimetics when co-administered with quaternary anticholinergics such as glycopyrrolate. It is not known whether donepezil hydrochloride and/or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration).</p><p>Dose-related signs of toxicity in animals included reduced spontaneous movement, prone position, staggering gait, lacrimation, clonic convulsions, depressed respiration, salivation, miosis, tremors, fasciculation, and lower body surface temperature.</p><h2>Memantine and Donepezil Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules contain memantine, an orally active NMDA receptor antagonist, as the hydrochloride salt and donepezil, a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, as the hydrochloride salt.</p><p><span class="Bold">Memantine Hydrochloride, USP</span></p><p>The chemical name for memantine hydrochloride, USP is 1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane hydrochloride with the following structural formula:</p><p> </p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>N• HCl and the molecular weight is 215.76.

Each of those medications is postulated to have a different mechanism in Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><span class="Bold">Memantine</span></p><p>Persistent activation of central nervous system NMDA receptors by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer’s disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity uncompetitive (open channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. There is no evidence that memantine prevents or slows neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><span class="Bold">Donepezil</span></p><p>Current theories on the pathogenesis of the cognitive signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease attribute some of them to a deficiency of cholinergic neurotransmission. Donepezil is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the central nervous system through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. There is no evidence that donepezil prevents or slows neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release</span></p><p>Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release was bioequivalent to co-administration of individual memantine hydrochloride extended-release and donepezil hydrochloride.</p><p>Exposure (AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of memantine and donepezil following memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release administration in the fed or fasted state was similar.

About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy memantine, and 1-nitroso-deaminated memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate.

Furthermore, memantine did not affect AChE inhibition by donepezil. In a 24-week controlled clinical study in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, the adverse event profile observed with a combination of memantine immediate-release and donepezil was similar to that of donepezil alone.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Memantine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies conducted with marker substrates of CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, -2A6, -2C9, -2D6, -2E1, -3A4) showed minimal inhibition of these enzymes by memantine.

However, co-administration of memantine hydrochloride and HCTZ/TA did not affect the bioavailability of either memantine or TA, and the bioavailability of HCTZ decreased by 20%. In addition, co-administration of memantine hydrochloride with the antihyperglycemic drug Glucovance<span class="Sup">®</span> (glyburide and metformin hydrochloride) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of memantine, metformin, and glyburide. Furthermore, memantine did not modify the serum glucose lowering effect of Glucovance<span class="Sup">®</span>, indicating the absence of a pharmacodynamic interaction.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins</span></p><p>Because the plasma protein binding of memantine is low (45%), an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to plasma proteins, such as warfarin and digoxin, is unlikely.</p><p><span class="Italics">Donepezil Hydrochloride</span></p><p>Pharmacokinetics of donepezil are linear over a dose range of 1 to 10 mg given once daily. The rate and extent of absorption of donepezil hydrochloride tablets are not influenced by food.</p><p>Donepezil is absorbed with a relative oral bioavailability of 100% and reaches peak plasma concentrations in 3 to 4 hours.</p><p>The elimination half-life of donepezil is about 70 hours, and the mean apparent plasma clearance (Cl/F) is 0.13 to 0.19 L/hr/kg. Following multiple dose administration, donepezil accumulates in plasma by 4 to 7 fold, and steady state is reached within 15 days. The steady-state volume of distribution is 12 to 16 L/kg. Donepezil is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins, mainly to albumins (about 75%) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (about 21%) over the concentration range of 2 to 1000 ng/mL.</p><p>Donepezil is both excreted in the urine intact and extensively metabolized to four major metabolites, two of which are known to be active, and a number of minor metabolites, not all of which have been identified. Donepezil is metabolized by CYP 450 isoenzymes 2D6 and 3A4 and undergoes glucuronidation. Following administration of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled donepezil, plasma radioactivity, expressed as a percent of the administered dose, was present primarily as intact donepezil (53%) and as 6-O-desmethyl donepezil (11%), which has been reported to inhibit AChE to the same extent as donepezil <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and was found in plasma at concentrations equal to about 20% of donepezil. Approximately 57% and 15% of the total radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively, over a period of 10 days, while 28% remained unrecovered, with about 17% of the donepezil dose recovered in the urine as unchanged drug. Examination of the effect of CYP2D6 genotype in Alzheimer’s patients showed differences in clearance values among CYP2D6 genotype subgroups. When compared to the extensive metabolizers, poor metabolizers had a 31.5% slower clearance and ultra-rapid metabolizers had a 24% faster clearance. These results suggest CYP2D6 has a minor role in the metabolism of donepezil.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>In a study of 11 patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt; 18 mL/min/ 1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) the clearance of donepezil hydrochloride did not differ from 11 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Disease</span></p><p>In a study of 10 patients with stable alcoholic cirrhosis, the clearance of donepezil hydrochloride was decreased by 20% relative to 10 healthy age- and sex-matched subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Age</span></p><p>No formal pharmacokinetic study was conducted to examine age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of donepezil hydrochloride.

Lesions were seen after a single dose of memantine. In a study in which rats were given daily oral doses of memantine for 14 days, the no-effect dose for neuronal necrosis was 4 times the dose of memantine at the MRHD of memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In acute and repeat-dose neurotoxicity studies in female rats, oral administration of memantine and donepezil in combination resulted in increased incidence, severity, and distribution of neurodegeneration compared with memantine alone.

Approximately 68% of the patients received donepezil as the AChEI. The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 76.5 years, with a range of 49 to 97 years. Approximately 72% of patients were female and 94% were Caucasian.</p><p><span class="Italics">Study Outcome Measures</span></p><p>The effectiveness of memantine hydrochloride extended-release was evaluated in this study using the co-primary efficacy parameters of Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) and the Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus).</p><p>The ability of memantine hydrochloride extended-release to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), a multi-item instrument that has been validated for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. The SIB examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of attention, orientation, language, memory, visuospatial ability, construction, praxis, and social interaction. The SIB scoring range is from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.</p><p>The ability of memantine hydrochloride extended-release to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using a Clinician’s Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information, the CIBIC-Plus. The CIBIC-Plus is not a single instrument and is not a standardized instrument like the ADCS-ADL or SIB. Clinical trials for investigational drugs have used a variety of CIBIC formats, each different in terms of depth and structure. As such, results from a CIBIC-Plus reflect clinical experience from the trial or trials in which it was used and cannot be compared directly with the results of CIBIC-Plus evaluations from other clinical trials. The CIBIC-Plus used in this trial was a structured instrument based on a comprehensive evaluation at baseline and subsequent time points of four domains: general (overall clinical status), functional</p><p>(including activities of daily living), cognitive, and behavioral. It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician using validated scales based on his/her observation during an interview with the patient, in combination with information supplied by a caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient over the interval rated. The CIBIC-Plus is scored as a seven point categorical rating, ranging from a score of 1, indicating “marked improvement” to a score of 4, indicating “no change” to a score of 7, indicating “marked worsening.” The CIBIC-Plus has not been systematically compared directly to assessments not using information from caregivers (CIBIC) or other global methods.</p><p><span class="Italics">Study Results</span></p><p>In this study, 677 patients were randomized to one of the following 2 treatments: memantine hydrochloride extended-release 28 mg/day or placebo, while still receiving an AChEI (either donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine).</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)</span></p><p>Figure 1 shows the time course for the change from baseline in SIB score for the two treatment groups completing the 24 weeks of the study.

Two hundred and forty eight (248) patients with severe Alzheimer's disease were randomized to donepezil hydrochloride or placebo. For patients randomized to donepezil hydrochloride, treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily for 28 days and then increased to 10 mg once daily. At the end of the 6 month treatment period, 90.5% of the donepezil hydrochloride treated patients were receiving the 10 mg/day dose. The mean age of patients was 84.9 years, with a range of 59 to 99. Approximately 77% of patients were women, and 23% were men. Almost all patients were Caucasian.

The ADCS- ADL-severe is derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory, which is a comprehensive battery of ADL questions used to measure the functional capabilities of patients. Each ADL item is rated from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss. The ADCS-ADL-severe is a subset of 19 items, including ratings of the patient's ability to eat, dress, bathe, use the telephone, get around (or travel), and perform other activities of daily living; it has been validated for the assessment of patients with moderate to severe dementia. The ADCS-ADL-severe has a scoring range of 0 to 54, with the lower scores indicating greater functional impairment. The investigator performs the inventory by interviewing a caregiver, in this study a nurse staff member, familiar with the functioning of the patient.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the SIB</span></p><p>Figure 5 shows the time course for the change from baseline in SIB score for the two treatment groups over the 6 months of the study.
