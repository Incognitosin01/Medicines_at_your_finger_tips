Myoglobin helps your muscle cells store oxygen.</p><p>Feraheme is used to treat iron deficiency anemia (a lack of red blood cells caused by having too little iron in the body).</p><p>Feraheme injection is used in people with chronic kidney disease, or in people unable to take oral iron (by mouth) or who have not responded well to oral iron</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Feraheme if you have ever had an allergic reaction to an injectable form of iron (including ferumoxytol), or if you have iron overload syndrome or any type of anemia that is not caused by iron deficiency.</p><p><b>Feraheme can cause severe and sometimes fatal allergic reactions</b>, even if you have used this medicine before without any reaction.
