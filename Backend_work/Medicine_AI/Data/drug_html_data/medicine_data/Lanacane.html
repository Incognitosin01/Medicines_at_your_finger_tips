It works by blocking nerve signals in your body.</p><p>Lanacane is used to reduce pain or discomfort caused by minor skin irritations, insect bites, poison ivy, sunburn, ingrown toenails, and many other sources of minor pain on a surface of the body.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Lanacane on a child younger than 2 years old.</b></p><p>An overdose of benzocaine can cause fatal side effects if too much of the medicine is absorbed through your skin and into your blood. Use the smallest amount needed.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Do not use Lanacane if you have ever had methemoglobinemia in the past.</p><p><b>Do not use Lanacane on a child younger than 2 years old.</b></p><p><b>An overdose of numbing medication can cause fatal side effects if too much of the medicine is absorbed through your skin and into your blood.</b> This can happen if you apply more than the recommended dose.</p><p>Fatal overdoses have occurred when numbing medicines were used without the advice of a medical doctor (such as during a cosmetic procedure like laser hair removal). Be aware that many cosmetic procedures are performed without a medical doctor present.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist if Lanacane is safe to use if you have:</p><ul>

Read all medication guides or instruction sheets.</p><p>Your body may absorb more of benzocaine if you use too much, if you apply it over large skin areas, or if you apply heat, bandages, or plastic wrap to treated skin areas. Skin that is cut or irritated may also absorb more topical medication than healthy skin.</p><p>Use the smallest amount needed to numb the skin or relieve pain. Do not use large amounts of Lanacane. Do not cover treated skin areas with a bandage or plastic wrap without medical advice.</p><p>Do not use Lanacane to treat large skin areas or deep puncture wounds. Avoid using the medicine on skin that is raw or blistered, such as a severe burn or abrasion.</p><p>To treat minor skin conditions, apply a thin layer of Lanacane to the affected area. If using the spray, hold the container 6 to 12 inches away from the skin. Do not spray this medication onto your face. Spray it instead on your hands and then rub it onto the face, avoiding contact with your eyes.</p><p>Clean the area with soap and water before applying this medicine.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse within the first 7 days of using Lanacane. Also call your doctor if your symptoms had cleared up but then came back.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not freeze.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Lanacane is used when needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. Skip any missed dose if it's almost time for your next dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An overdose of benzocaine applied to the skin can cause life-threatening side effects</b> such as uneven heartbeats, seizure (convulsions), coma, slowed breathing, or respiratory failure (breathing stops).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Lanacane?</h2><p>Lanacane is for use only on the surface of your body. Avoid getting this medication in your eyes.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Lanacane side effects</h2><p>Lanacane should not be used in the mouth. Other products containing benzocaine are used in the mouth and may cause a condition in which the oxygen in your body tissues can become dangerously low. This is a potentially fatal condition called methemoglobinemia (met-HEEM-oh glo-bin-EE-mee-a). This condition may occur after only one use of benzocaine or after several uses.</p><p>Signs and symptoms may occur within minutes or up to 2 hours after using benzocaine in the mouth or throat.
