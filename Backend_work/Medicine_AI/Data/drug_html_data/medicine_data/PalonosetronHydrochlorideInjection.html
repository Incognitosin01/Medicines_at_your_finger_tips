</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection</h2><p class="First">Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is indicated in adults for prevention of:</p><ul>
<li>acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC).</li>
<li>acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC).</li>
<li>postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for up to 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy beyond 24 hours has not been demonstrated.</li>
</ul><p>As with other antiemetics, routine prophylaxis is not recommended in patients in whom there is little expectation that nausea and/or vomiting will occur postoperatively. In patients where nausea and vomiting must be avoided during the postoperative period, Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is recommended even where the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting is low.</p><p>Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is indicated in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 17 years of age for prevention of:</p><ul>
<li>acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.</li>

</ul><h2>DOSAGE FORM AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is sterile, clear, and colorless solution:</p><ul>
<li>0.25 mg palonosetron in 5 mL (0.05 mg/mL) in a single-dose vial</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is contraindicated in patients known to have hypersensitivity to palonosetron <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection  <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> . These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.</p><p>Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span> .</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Serious or otherwise clinically significant adverse reactions reported in other sections of labeling:</p><ul>

</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Monitor for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron HCl at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting</span></p><p>Safety and effectiveness of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy <span class="Italics"> [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2)]</span> . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1)]</span> .</p><p>Safety and effectiveness of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies</span></p><p>Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed.</p><p>Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed.</p><p>Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron HCl (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies ( 14.1, 14.3)]</span> . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]</span> . No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no known antidote to palonosetron. Overdose should be managed with supportive care. </p><p>Dialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is unlikely to be an effective treatment for palonosetron overdose. A single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 30 mg/kg (947 and 474 times the human dose for rats and mice, respectively, based on body surface area) was lethal to rats and mice. The major signs of toxicity were convulsions, gasping, pallor, cyanosis and collapse.</p><h2>Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection contains palonosetron as palonosetron HCl, an antiemetic and antinauseant agent. It is a serotonin-3 (5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span>) receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor. Chemically, palonosetron hydrochloride is: (3a <span class="Bold">S)</span>-2-[( <span class="Bold">S</span>)-1-Azabicyclo [2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1-oxo-1 <span class="Italics">H-</span>benz[ <span class="Italics">de</span>]isoquinoline hydrochloride. The empirical formula is C <span class="Sub">19</span>H <span class="Sub">24</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>O.HCl, with a molecular weight of 332.87. Palonosetron hydrochloride exists as a single isomer and has the following structural formula:</p><p>Palonosetron hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water, soluble in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol and 2-propanol.</p><p>Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is a sterile, clear, colorless, non-pyrogenic, isotonic, buffered solution for intravenous administration. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is available as a 5 mL single-dose vial.</p><p>Each 5 mL vial contains: 0.25 mg palonosetron (equivalent to 0.28 mg palonosetron HCl), 207.5 mg mannitol and citrate buffer in water for intravenous administration.</p><p>The pH of the solution in the 5 mL vial is 4.5 to 5.5.</p><h2>Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Palonosetron is a 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. </p><p>Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex.</p><p>Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration.</p><p>At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC <span class="Sub">0-∞</span>) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (±SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 ± 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 ± 20.9 h·mcg/L.</p><p>Following intravenous administration of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42±34%. Following intravenous administration of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (±SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110±45%.</p><p>After intravenous dosing of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 ± 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination </span></p><p>After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ <span class="Sup">14</span>C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 ± 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 ± 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4. The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg.</p><p>The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PK Parameter</span> *</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Age Group</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Less than</span><br/>

Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC= 29.8 h·mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma.</p><p>Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test.</p><p>Palonosetron HCl at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults</h3><p class="First">Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy.
