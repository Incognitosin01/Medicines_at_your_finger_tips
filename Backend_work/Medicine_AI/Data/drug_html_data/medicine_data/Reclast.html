This can slow bone loss and may help prevent bone fractures.</p><p>Reclast is used to treat or prevent osteoporosis caused by menopause, or steroid use. This medicine also increases bone mass in men with osteoporosis. Reclast is for use when you have a high risk of bone fracture.</p><p>Reclast is also used to treat Paget's disease of bone.</p><p>Zometa is another brand of zoledronic acid used to treat high blood levels of calcium caused by cancer (also called hypercalcemia of malignancy). This medicine also treats multiple myeloma (a type of bone marrow cancer) or bone cancer that has spread from elsewhere in the body. You should not use Reclast and Zometa at the same time.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Reclast may harm an unborn baby.</b> Avoid getting pregnant while using this medicine and tell your doctor if you become pregnant.</p><p><b>Reclast can cause serious kidney problems,</b> especially if you are dehydrated, if you take diuretic medicine, or if you already have kidney disease. Call your doctor if you urinate less than usual, if you have swelling in your feet or ankles, or if you feel tired or short of breath.</p><p>Also call your doctor if you have muscle spasms, numbness or tingling (in hands and feet or around the mouth), new or unusual hip pain, or severe pain in your joints, bones, or muscles.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you have a dental exam for preventive tooth and gum care before you start your treatment with zoledronic acid. This is especially important if you have cancer, if you are undergoing chemotherapy or using steroids, or if you have poor dental health.</p><p>Some people using medicines similar to Reclast have developed bone loss in the jaw, also called osteonecrosis of the jaw. Symptoms of this condition may include jaw pain, swelling, numbness, loose teeth, gum infection, or slow healing after injury or surgery involving the gums. You may be more likely to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw if you have cancer or have been treated with chemotherapy, radiation, or steroids. Other conditions associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw include blood clotting disorders, anemia (low red blood cells), and pre-existing dental problems.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Reclast if you are allergic to zoledronic acid.</p><p>You also should not receive <b>Reclast</b> if you have:</p><ul>
