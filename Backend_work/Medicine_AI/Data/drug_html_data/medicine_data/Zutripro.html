Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that reduces the effects of natural chemical histamine in the body. Histamine can produce symptoms of sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and runny nose. Hydrocodone is a narcotic cough suppressant. It affects the signals in the brain that trigger cough reflex. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages. Dilated blood vessels can cause nasal congestion (stuffy nose).</p><p>Zutripro is used to treat runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, itching, watery eyes, cough, and sinus congestion caused by allergies, the common cold, or the flu.</p><p>Zutripro will not treat a cough that is caused by smoking, asthma, or emphysema.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Zutripro may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert. Drinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of this medicine. Before using this medication, tell your doctor if you regularly use other medicines that make you sleepy (such as cold or allergy medicine, sedatives, narcotic pain medicine, sleeping pills, muscle relaxers, and medicine for seizures, depression, or anxiety). They can add to sleepiness caused by Zutripro.</p><p>Hydrocodone can slow or stop your breathing, and may be habit-forming. <b>MISUSE OF ZUTRIPRO CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Never share hydrocodone with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. Keep Zutripro in a place where others cannot get to it.</p><p><b>Zutripro Oral Solution is not for use in anyone under 18.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Zutripro if you are allergic to chlorpheniramine, hydrocodone, or pseudoephedrine.</p><p>Do not use Zutripro if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days.
