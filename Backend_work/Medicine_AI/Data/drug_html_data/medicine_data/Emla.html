It works by blocking nerve signals in your body.</p><p>Emla cream is used to numb normal intact skin or the membrane surfaces of the penis or vagina. Emla is used to prepare you for minor surgery or medical procedures on these areas.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>An overdose of numbing medicine can cause fatal side effects if too much of the medicine is absorbed through your skin.</b> Overdose symptoms may include uneven heartbeats, seizure (convulsions), coma, slowed breathing, or respiratory failure (breathing stops).</p><p>Use the smallest amount of this medicine needed to numb the skin. <b>Do not use large amounts of Emla, or cover treated skin areas with a bandage or plastic wrap without medical advice.</b></p><p>Skin that is cut or irritated may also absorb more topical medication than healthy skin.</p><p>Use the smallest amount of this medication needed to numb the skin or relieve pain. Do not use large amounts of Emla , or cover treated skin areas with a bandage or plastic wrap without medical advice. Be aware that many cosmetic procedures are performed without a medical doctor present.</p><p>Before Emla is applied, tell your doctor if you have liver disease, a history of allergic reaction to lidocaine or prilocaine, or a personal or family history of methemoglobinemia, or any genetic enzyme deficiency.</p><p>Avoid accidentally injuring treated skin areas while they are numb. Avoid coming into contact with very hot or very cold surfaces.</p><h2>Before using this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Emla cream if you are allergic to any type of numbing medicine.</p><p>Fatal overdoses have occurred when numbing medicines were used without the advice of a medical doctor (such as during a cosmetic procedure like laser hair removal). However, overdose has also occurred in women treated with a numbing medicine before having a mammography.</p><p>Be aware that many cosmetic procedures are performed without a medical doctor present.</p><p>To make sure Emla is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
