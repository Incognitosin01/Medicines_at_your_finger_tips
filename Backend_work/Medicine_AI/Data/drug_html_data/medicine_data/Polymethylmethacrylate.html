The microspheres stimulate a local inflammatory reaction that is followed by the deposition of granulation tissue during the first few weeks after implantation. The connective tissue subsequently matures, and by three months after injection, PMMA microspheres are surrounded by newly formed collagen. The presence of new collagen accounts for the observed volume-filling effect (Cohen 2004; Lemperle 2010).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Nasolabial folds and facial acne scars</b><b>: </b> Correction of nasolabial folds and moderate to severe, atrophic, distensible facial acne scars on the cheek in patients 21 years and older.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to polymethylmethacrylate, lidocaine, bovine collagen, or any component of the formulation; positive response to Bellafill Skin test; patients with severe allergies manifested by a history of anaphylaxis or history or presence of multiple severe allergies; patients undergoing or planning to undergo desensitization injections to meat products; patients with bleeding disorders; patients with susceptibility to keloid formation or hypertrophic scarring; use for lip augmentation and injection into the vermilion or the wet mucosa of the lip.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note: </b>A skin test should be performed 4 weeks prior to treatment.
