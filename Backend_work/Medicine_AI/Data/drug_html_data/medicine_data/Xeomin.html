Botulinum toxin blocks nerve activity in the muscles, causing a temporary reduction in muscle activity.</p><p>Xeomin injection is used <b>in adults</b> to treat:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>muscle spasms and stiffness of the arms (upper limb spasticity);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cervical dystonia (severe spasms in the neck muscles), or muscle stiffness in the elbows, wrists, fingers, ankles, or toes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>certain eye muscle conditions caused by nerve disorders (including uncontrolled blinking or spasm of the eyelids, and a condition in which the eyes do not point in the same direction); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to temporarily lessen the appearance of facial wrinkles (sometimes called "frown lines") between the eyebrows.</p>

This can cause serious life-threatening side effects.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have a hoarse voice, drooping eyelids, vision problems, severe muscle weakness, loss of bladder control, or trouble breathing, talking, or swallowing. Some of these effects can occur up to several weeks after a Xeomin injection. Do not seek botulinum toxin injections from more than one medical professional at a time. If you switch healthcare providers, be sure to tell your new provider how long it has been since your last botulinum toxin injection.</p><p>Using Xeomin more often than prescribed will not make it more effective and may result in serious side effects.</p><p>The effects of a Xeomin injection are temporary. Your symptoms may return completely within 3 months after an injection. After repeat injections, it may take less and less time before your symptoms return, especially if your body develops antibodies to the botulinum toxin.</p><h2>Before using this medicine</h2><p>To make sure Xeomin is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

A healthcare provider will give you this injection once every 12 to 16 weeks. <b>Xeomin injections should be spaced at least 12 weeks apart.</b></p><p>Botulinum toxin injections <b>should be given only by a trained medical professional</b>, even when used for cosmetic purposes.</p><p>Your Xeomin injection may be given into more than one area at a time, depending on the condition being treated.</p><p>While receiving injections for eye muscle conditions, you may need to use eye drops, ointment, a special contact lens or other device to protect the surface of your eye. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>It may take up to 7 days after injection before neck muscle spasm symptoms begin to improve.</p><p>The effects of a Xeomin injection are temporary. Your symptoms may return completely within 3 months. After repeat injections, it may take less and less time before your symptoms return, especially if your body develops antibodies to the botulinum toxin.</p><p>Do not seek botulinum toxin injections from more than one medical professional at a time.
