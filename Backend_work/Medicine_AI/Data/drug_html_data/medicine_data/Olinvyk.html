</li>
</ul><p>severe asthma or breathing problems; or</p><p>a stomach or bowel obstruction (including paralytic ileus).</p><p>In some people, Olinvyk breaks down very slowly in the liver and reaches higher than normal levels in the body. This can cause dangerously slow breathing and may cause death. Tell your doctor if you've ever been told you are a "poor metabolizer."</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, or other breathing disorder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liver disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low blood pressure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>long QT syndrome (in you or a family member);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>drug or alcohol addiction;</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul><p>asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, or other breathing disorder;</p><p>liver disease;</p><p>low blood pressure;</p><p>long QT syndrome (in you or a family member);</p><p>drug or alcohol addiction;</p><p>depression, mental illness;</p><p>problems with your gallbladder or pancreas; or</p><p>a head injury, brain tumor, or seizure.</p><p><b>If you use opioid medicine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug.</b> This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p>Long-term use of opioid medication may affect fertility (ability to have children) in men or women. It is not known whether opioid effects on fertility are permanent.</p><p><b>Ask a doctor before using this medicine if you are breastfeeding.</b> Tell your doctor if you notice severe drowsiness or slow breathing in the nursing baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is  Olinvyk given?</h2><p>Olinvyk is given around the clock (continuous) using an infusion pump attached to a catheter placed into a vein. A healthcare provider can teach you how to properly use the infusion pump by yourself.</p><p>Never use Olinvyk in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to use more of  Olinvyk.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medicine in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.</p><p>Tell your caregivers if you feel any burning, pain, or swelling around your port needle.</p><p>If you have used opioid medicine regularly and are opioid-dependent, you should not stop using Olinvyk suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since  Olinvyk is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. The infusion pump will control how much and how often you use this medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An opioid overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include severe drowsiness, limp muscles, cold or clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, slow heartbeats, slow breathing, or no breathing.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you get naloxone (a medicine to reverse an opioid overdose) and keep it with you at all times. A person caring for you can give the naloxone if you stop breathing or don't wake up. Your caregiver must still get emergency medical help and may need to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on you while waiting for help to arrive.</p><p>Anyone can buy naloxone from a pharmacy or local health department. Make sure any person caring for you knows where you keep naloxone and how to use it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  Olinvyk?</h2><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how  Olinvyk will affect you.
