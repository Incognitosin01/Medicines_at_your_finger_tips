2.2 Special Precautions<br/>
• Inform patients that, if Ambator Diclofenac Patch begins to peel-off, the edges of the patch<br/>
may be taped down. If problems with adhesion persist, patients may overlay the patch with a mesh<br/>
netting sleeve, where appropriate (e.g. to secure patches applied to ankles, knees, or elbows). The<br/>
mesh netting sleeve (e.g. Curad® Hold Tite™, Surgilast® Tubular Elastic Dressing) must allow air to<br/>
pass through and not be occlusive (non-breathable).<br/>
• Do not apply Ambator Diclofenac Patch to non-intact or damaged skin resulting from any etiology<br/>
e.g. exudative dermatitis, eczema, infected lesion, burns or wounds.<br/>
• Do not wear a Ambator Diclofenac Patch when bathing or showering.<br/>
• Wash your hands after applying, handling or removing the patch.<br/>
• Avoid eye contact<br/>
• Do not use combination therapy with Ambator Diclofenac Patch and an oral NSAID unless the benefit<br/>
outweighs the risk and conduct periodic laboratory evaluations.</p><p><span class="Bold">3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</span><br/>

PATCH&gt;1.5%.</p><p><span class="Bold">4 CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><br/>
Ambator Diclofenac Patch is contraindicated in the following patients:<br/>
• Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to diclofenac or<br/>
any components of the drug product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.9)]<br/>
• History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other<br/>
NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such<br/>
patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)]<br/>
• In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [see Warnings and Precautions<br/>
(5.1)]<br/>
• Ambator Diclofenac Patch is contraindicated for use on non-intact or damaged skin resulting from<br/>
any etiology, including exudative dermatitis, eczema, infection lesions, burns or wounds.</p><p><span class="Bold">5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p>5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<br/>
Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration<br/>
have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial<br/>
infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the<br/>
risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV<br/>
thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and<br/>
without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or<br/>
risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their<br/>
increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV<br/>
thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic<br/>
risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.<br/>
To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest<br/>
effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for<br/>
the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of<br/>
previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the<br/>
steps to take if they occur.<br/>
There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of<br/>
serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID,<br/>
such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and<br/>
Precautions (5.2)].<br/>
Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery<br/>
Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the<br/>
first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and<br/>
stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].<br/>
Post-MI Patients<br/>
Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients<br/>
treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death,<br/>
and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the<br/>
incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients<br/>
compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of<br/>
death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID<br/>
users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.<br/>
Avoid the use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are<br/>
expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Ambator Diclofenac Patch is<br/>
used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><p>5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation<br/>
NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including<br/>
inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or<br/>
large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or<br/>
without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.<br/>
Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is<br/>
symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in<br/>
approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one<br/>
year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.<br/>
Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation<br/>
Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a<br/>
greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these<br/>
risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs<br/>
include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin,<br/>
anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older<br/>
age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in<br/>
elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or<br/>
coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.<br/>
Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:<br/>
• Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.<br/>
• Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</p><p>• Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk<br/>
of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate<br/>
therapies other than NSAIDs.<br/>
• Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.<br/>
• If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and<br/>
discontinue Ambator Diclofenac Patch PATCH until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.<br/>
• In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients<br/>
more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].</p><p>5.3 Hepatotoxicity<br/>
In clinical trials of oral diclofenac containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3<br/>
times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time<br/>
during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).<br/>
In a large open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for<br/>
2-6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24<br/>
weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of the 3,700 patients and<br/>
included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In<br/>
that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3-8<br/>
times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in<br/>
patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen<br/>
more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.<br/>
Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic.<br/>
Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51<br/>
patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.<br/>
In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first<br/>
month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment<br/>
with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions,<br/>
including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver<br/>
failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.<br/>
In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac<br/>
associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were<br/>
associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this<br/>
particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with<br/>
diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more,<br/>
and duration of use for more than 90 days.<br/>
Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving<br/>
long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of<br/>
distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase<br/>
measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences,<br/>
transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac.<br/>
However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.<br/>
If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver<br/>
disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain,<br/>
diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), Ambator Diclofenac Patch should be discontinued immediately.<br/>
Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue,<br/>
lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms).<br/>
If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations<br/>
occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue Ambator Diclofenac Patch immediately, and<br/>
perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.<br/>
To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise<br/>
caution when prescribing Ambator Diclofenac Patch with concomitant drugs that are known to be<br/>
potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, anti-epileptics).</p><p>5.4 Hypertension<br/>
NSAIDs, including Ambator Diclofenac Patch, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of<br/>
preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.<br/>
Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop<br/>
diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions<br/>
(7)].<br/>
Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of<br/>
therapy.</p><p>5.5 Heart Failure and Edema<br/>
The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled<br/>
trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in<br/>
COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-<br/>
treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use<br/>
increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.<br/>
Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs.<br/>
Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these<br/>
medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see<br/>
Drug Interactions (7)].<br/>
Avoid the use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits<br/>
are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Ambator Diclofenac Patch is used<br/>
in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><p>5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia<br/>
Renal Toxicity<br/>
Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.<br/>
Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role<br/>
in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a<br/>
dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which<br/>
may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those<br/>
with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those<br/>
taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is<br/>
usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.<br/>
No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of AMBATOR DICLOFENAC<br/>
PATCH may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.<br/>
Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating AMBATOR DICLOFENAC<br/>
PATCH. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure,<br/>
dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch [see Drug Interactions (7)].<br/>
Avoid the use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch in patients with advanced renal disease unless the<br/>
benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If Ambator Diclofenac Patch<br/>
is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal<br/>
function.<br/>
Hyperkalemia<br/>
Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of<br/>
NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function,<br/>
these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><p>5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions<br/>
Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known<br/>
hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications<br/>
(4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].<br/>
Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><p>5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity<br/>
A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic<br/>
rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or<br/>
intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs<br/>
has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Ambator Diclofenac Patch is contraindicated<br/>
in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. When AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity),<br/>
monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><p>5.9 Serious Skin Reactions<br/>
NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative<br/>
dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be<br/>
fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms<br/>
of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch at the first<br/>
appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Ambator Diclofenac Patch is<br/>
contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs<br/>
[see Contraindications (4)].</p><p>5.10 Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus<br/>
Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs,<br/>
including Ambator Diclofenac Patch, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third<br/>
trimester) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</p><p>5.11 Hematologic Toxicity<br/>
Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid<br/>
retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.<br/>
NSAIDs, including Ambator Diclofenac Patch, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid<br/>
conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants,<br/>
antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin<br/>
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs<br/>
of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].</p><p>5.12 Masking of Inflammation and Fever<br/>
The pharmacological activity of Ambator Diclofenac Patch in reducing inflammation, and possibly<br/>
fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><p>5.13 Laboratory Monitoring<br/>
Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or<br/>
signs, consider monitoring patients on long- term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry<br/>
profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)].</p><p>5.14 Accidental Exposure in Children<br/>
Even a used Ambator Diclofenac Patch contains a large amount of diclofenac sodium (as much as 170<br/>
mg). The potential therefore exists for a small child or pet to suffer serious adverse effects from<br/>
chewing or ingesting a new or used Ambator Diclofenac Patch. It is important for patients to store<br/>
and dispose of Ambator Diclofenac Patch out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>5.15 Eye Exposure<br/>
Avoid contact of Ambator Diclofenac Patch with eyes and mucosa. Advise patients that if eye contact<br/>
occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and consult a physician if irritation<br/>
persists for more than an hour.</p><p>5.16 Oral Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs<br/>
Concomitant use of oral and topical NSAIDs may result in a higher rate of hemorrhage, more frequent<br/>
abnormal creatinine, urea and hemoglobin. Do not use combination therapy with Ambator Diclofenac<br/>
Patch and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">6 ADVERSE REACTIONS</span><br/>

• Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</p><p>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience<br/>
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates<br/>
observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical<br/>
trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>
In controlled trials during the premarketing development of Ambator Diclofenac Patch, approximately<br/>
600 patients with minor sprains, strains, and contusions were treated with Ambator Diclofenac Patch<br/>
for up to two weeks.<br/>
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment<br/>
In the controlled trials, 3% of patients in both the Ambator Diclofenac Patch and placebo patch<br/>
groups discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The most common adverse events leading to<br/>
discontinuation were application site reactions, occurring in 2% of both the AMBATOR DICLOFENAC<br/>
PATCH and placebo patch groups. Application site reactions leading to dropout included pruritus,<br/>
dermatitis, and burning.<br/>
Common Adverse Events<br/>
Localized Reactions<br/>
Overall, the most common adverse events associated with Ambator Diclofenac Patch treatment were<br/>
skin reactions at the site of treatment. Table 1 lists all adverse events, regardless of causality,<br/>
occurring in ≥ 1% of patients in controlled trials of Ambator Diclofenac Patch. A majority of<br/>
patients treated with Ambator Diclofenac Patch had adverse events with a maximum intensity of<br/>
"mild" or "moderate."<br/>

See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac.<br/>
Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac</p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis</span></p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>• Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The<br/>
concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding<br/>
compared to the use of either drug alone.<br/>
• Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort<br/>
epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake<br/>
and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of</p><p>bleeding more than an NSAID alone.</p><p>Intervention:</p><p>Monitor patients with concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch with anticoagulants (e.g.,<br/>
warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),<br/>
and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and<br/>
Precautions (5.11)].</p><p>Aspirin</p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of<br/>
aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical<br/>
study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased<br/>
incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone<br/>
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</p><p>Intervention:</p><p>Concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally<br/>
recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].</p><p>Ambator Diclofenac Patch is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.<br/>
ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers</p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>• NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)<br/>
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).<br/>
• In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have<br/>
renal impairment, co- administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in<br/>
deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually<br/>
reversible.</p><p>Intervention:</p><p>• During concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or<br/>
beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.<br/>
• During concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are<br/>
elderly, volume- depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal<br/>
function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].<br/>
• When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess<br/>
renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.</p><p>Diuretics</p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the<br/>
natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients.<br/>
This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.</p><p>Intervention:</p><p>During concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch with diuretics, observe patients for signs of<br/>
worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive<br/>
effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</p><p>Digoxin</p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum<br/>
concentration and prolong the half- life of digoxin.</p><p>Intervention: During concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and digoxin, monitor<br/>
serum digoxin levels.</p><p>Lithium</p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance.<br/>
The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by<br/>
approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to<br/>
NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.</p><p>Intervention: During concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and lithium, monitor<br/>
patients for signs of lithium toxicity.</p><p>Methotrexate</p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g.,<br/>
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).</p><p>Intervention: During concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and methotrexate,<br/>
monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.</p><p>Cyclosporine</p><p>Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and cyclosporine may increase<br/>
cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity.</p><p>Intervention:</p><p>During concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of<br/>
worsening renal function.</p><p>NSAIDs and Salicylates</p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate)<br/>
increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and<br/>
Precautions (5.2)].</p><p>Intervention: The concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not<br/>
recommended.</p><p>Pemetrexed</p><p>Clinical Impact:</p><p>Concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and pemetrexed may increase the risk of<br/>
pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing<br/>
information).</p><p>Intervention:</p><p>During concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and pemetrexed, in patients with renal<br/>
impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression,<br/>
renal and GI toxicity.<br/>
NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a<br/>
period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.<br/>
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer<br/>
half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for<br/>
at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</span></p><p>8.1 Pregnancy<br/>
Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting 30 weeks gestation. Risk<br/>
Summary<br/>
Use of NSAIDs, including Ambator Diclofenac Patch, during the third trimester of pregnancy<br/>
increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs,<br/>
including Ambator Diclofenac Patch, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third<br/>
trimester).<br/>
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Ambator Diclofenac Patch in pregnant women.<br/>
Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the<br/>
first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all<br/>
clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for<br/>
major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss.<br/>
In animal reproduction studies, diclofenac sodium administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits<br/>
during the period of organogenesis produced embryotoxicity at approximately 3 and 7 times,<br/>
respectively, the topical exposure from the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH. In rats, increased incidences of skeletal anomalies and maternal toxicity were<br/>
also observed at this dose. Diclofenac sodium administered orally to both male and female rats<br/>
prior to mating and throughout the mating period, and during gestation and lactation in females<br/>
produced embryotoxicity at doses approximately 3 and 7 times, respectively, the topical exposure<br/>
from the MRHD [see Data].<br/>
Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial<br/>
vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies,<br/>
administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre-<br/>
and post- implantation loss.<br/>
Clinical Considerations</p><p>Labor or Delivery<br/>
There are no studies on the effects of Ambator Diclofenac Patch during labor or delivery. In animal<br/>
studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition,<br/>
and increase the incidence of stillbirth.<br/>
Data<br/>
Animal data<br/>
Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were administered 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg diclofenac sodium via oral gavage<br/>
daily from gestation days 6 to 15. Maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and increased incidence of<br/>
skeletal anomalies were noted with 6 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium, which corresponds to 3 times the<br/>
maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area comparison. Pregnant New<br/>
Zealand White rabbits were administered 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg diclofenac sodium via oral gavage daily<br/>
from gestation days 6 to 18. No maternal toxicity was noted; however, embryotoxicity was evident at<br/>
6 mg/kg/day group which corresponds to 7 times the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans<br/>
based on a body surface area comparison.<br/>
Male rats were orally administered diclofenac sodium (1, 3, 6 mg/kg) for 60 days prior to mating<br/>
and throughout the mating period, and females were given the same doses 14 days prior to mating and<br/>
through mating, gestation, and lactation. Embryotoxicity was observed at 6 mg/kg diclofenac sodium<br/>
(3 times the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area comparison),<br/>
and was manifested as an increase in early resorptions, post-implantation losses, and a decrease in<br/>
live fetuses. The number of live born and total born were also reduced as was F1 postnatal<br/>
survival, but the physical and behavioral development of surviving F1 pups in all groups was the<br/>
same as the deionized water control, nor was reproductive performance adversely affected despite a<br/>
slight treatment-related reduction in body weight.</p><p>8.2 Lactation<br/>
Risk Summary<br/>
Based on available data, diclofenac may be present in human milk. The developmental and health<br/>
benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH or from the underlying maternal condition.<br/>
Data<br/>
One woman treated orally with a diclofenac salt, 150 mg/day, had a milk diclofenac level of 100<br/>
mcg/L, equivalent to an infant dose of about 0.03 mg/kg/day. Diclofenac was not detectable in<br/>
breast milk in 12 women using diclofenac (after either 100 mg/day orally for 7 days or a single 50<br/>
mg intramuscular dose administered in the immediate postpartum period). The relative<br/>
bioavailability for Ambator Diclofenac Patch is &lt;1% of a single 50 mg diclofenac tablet.</p><p>8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential<br/>
Infertility<br/>
Females<br/>
Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with<br/>
reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of<br/>
prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin- mediated follicular<br/>
rupture required for ovulation.<br/>
Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation.<br/>
Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including Ambator Diclofenac Patch, in women who have difficulties<br/>
conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><p>8.4 Pediatric Use<br/>
The safety and effectiveness of Ambator Diclofenac Patch in pediatric patients have not been<br/>
established.</p><p>8.5 Geriatric Use<br/>
Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious<br/>
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for<br/>
the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing<br/>
range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6,<br/>
5.13)].<br/>
Clinical studies of Ambator Diclofenac Patch did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65<br/>
and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported<br/>
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger<br/>
patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">10 OVERDOSAGE</span><br/>
Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness,<br/>
nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care.<br/>
Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression,<br/>
and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)].</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no<br/>
specific antidotes. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may<br/>
not be useful due to high protein binding.<br/>

Ambator Diclofenac Patch (diclofenac sodiumPatch) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug,<br/>
available for topical application. Ambator Diclofenac Patch is a 12.5 cm × 8.5 cm patch comprised<br/>
of an adhesive material containing 1.5% diclofenac sodium which is applied to a non-woven polyester<br/>
felt backing and covered with a polypropylene film release liner. The release liner is removed<br/>
prior to topical application to the skin.<br/>
The chemical name of diclofenac sodium is Sodium [o-(2,6-dichloranilino) phenyl] acetate, with a<br/>
molecular formula of C14H10Cl2NNaO2, and molecular weight 318.13, a benzene acetic acid derivate,<br/>
and the following chemical structure:</p><p>Each adhesive patch contains 180 mg of diclofenac sodium (13 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous<br/>
base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: Aqua (Purified Water), Dihydroxyaluminum<br/>
Aminoacetate, Glycerol, Kaolin, Methyl Paraben, Polyacrylic Acid, Polysorbate-80, Propyl Paraben,<br/>
Propylene Glycol, PVP, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tartaric Acid, Titanium Dioxide</p><p><span class="Bold">12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></p><p>12.1 Mechanism of Action<br/>
Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.<br/>
The mechanism of action of diclofenac, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but<br/>
involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).<br/>
Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Diclofenac concentrations<br/>
reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and<br/>
potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators<br/>
of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action<br/>
may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><p>12.2 Pharmacodynamics<br/>
Ambator Diclofenac Patch applied to intact skin provides local analgesia by releasing diclofenac<br/>
sodium from the patch into the skin.</p><p>12.3 Pharmacokinetics<br/>
Absorption<br/>
Following a single application of the Ambator Diclofenac Patch on the upper inner arm, peak plasma<br/>
concentrations of diclofenac (range<br/>
0.7 – 6 ng/mL) were noted between 10 – 20 hours of application. Plasma concentrations of diclofenac<br/>
in the range of 1.3 – 8.8 ng/mL were noted after five days with twice-a-day AMBATOR DICLOFENAC<br/>
PATCH application.<br/>
Systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations of diclofenac, after repeated dosing for<br/>
four days with Ambator Diclofenac Patch, were lower (&lt;1%) than after a single oral 50-mg diclofenac<br/>
sodium tablet.<br/>
The pharmacokinetics of Ambator Diclofenac Patch has been tested in healthy volunteers at rest or<br/>
undergoing moderate exercise (cycling 20 min/h for 12 h at a mean HR of 100.3 bpm). No clinically<br/>
relevant differences in systemic absorption were observed, with peak plasma concentrations in the<br/>
range of 2.2 – 8.1 ng/mL while resting, and 2.7 – 7.2 ng/mL during exercise.<br/>
Distribution</p><p>Diclofenac has a very high affinity (&gt;99%) for human serum albumin. Diclofenac diffuses into and<br/>
out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those<br/>
in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than<br/>
plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness<br/>
of diclofenac.<br/>
Elimination<br/>
Metabolism<br/>
Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include<br/>
4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5- dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The<br/>
major diclofenac metabolite, 4'hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The<br/>
formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its<br/>
oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion.<br/>
Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in<br/>
diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and<br/>
3'-hydroxy- diclofenac.<br/>
Excretion<br/>
The plasma elimination half-life of diclofenac after application of Ambator Diclofenac Patch is<br/>
approximately 12 hours. Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and<br/>
biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no<br/>
free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in<br/>
the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites.<br/>
Specific Populations<br/>
The pharmacokinetics of Ambator Diclofenac Patch has not been investigated in children, patients<br/>
with hepatic or renal impairment, or specific racial groups.<br/>
Drug Interaction Studies<br/>
Aspirin: When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced,<br/>
although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction<br/>
is not known. See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin<br/>
[see Drug Interactions (7)].</p><p><span class="Bold">13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</span></p><p>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<br/>
Carcinogenesis<br/>
Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of<br/>
either diclofenac sodium or Ambator Diclofenac Patch.<br/>
Mutagenesis<br/>
Diclofenac sodium is not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains, nor does it induce an<br/>
increase in metabolic aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes, or the frequency of micronucleated<br/>
cells in the bone marrow micronucleus test performed in rats.<br/>
Impairment of Fertility<br/>
The effect of diclofenac sodium on fertility in animals has been summarized in 8.1 under Animal<br/>
Data.<br/>
Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were administered 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium via<br/>
oral gavage (males treated for 60 days prior to conception and during mating period, females<br/>
treated for 14 days prior to mating through day 19 of gestation). Diclofenac sodium treatment with<br/>
6 mg/kg/day resulted in increased early resorptions and post-implantation losses; however, no<br/>
effects on the mating and fertility indices were found. The 6 mg/kg/day dose corresponds to 3 times<br/>
the maximum recommended daily exposure in humans based on a body surface area comparison.</p><p><span class="Bold">14 CLINICAL STUDIES</span></p><p>14.1 Ankle Sprains<br/>
Efficacy of Ambator Diclofenac Patch was demonstrated in two of four studies of patients with minor<br/>
sprains, strains, and contusions. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with the AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH, or a placebo patch identical to the Ambator Diclofenac Patch minus the active<br/>
ingredient. In the first of these two studies, patients with ankle sprains were treated once daily<br/>
for a week. In the second study, patients with sprains, strains and contusions were treated twice<br/>
daily for up to two weeks. Pain was assessed over the period of treatment. Patients treated with<br/>
the Ambator Diclofenac Patch experienced a greater reduction in pain as compared to patients<br/>
randomized to placebo patch as evidenced by the responder curves presented below (Figures 1-4).<br/>

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) that accompanies<br/>
each prescription dispensed, as well as the Directions for Use on the product packaging. Inform<br/>
patients, families, or their caregivers of the following information before initiating therapy with<br/>
Ambator Diclofenac Patch and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.<br/>
Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events<br/>
Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest<br/>
pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to<br/>
their health care provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].<br/>
Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation<br/>
Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain,<br/>
dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their health care provider. In the setting of concomitant use<br/>
of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for and the<br/>
signs and symptoms of GI bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].<br/>
Hepatotoxicity<br/>
Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue,<br/>
lethargy, pruritus, diarrhea, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms).<br/>
If these occur, instruct patients to stop Ambator Diclofenac Patch and seek immediate medical<br/>
therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].<br/>
Heart Failure and Edema<br/>
Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of<br/>
breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms<br/>
occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].<br/>
Anaphylactic Reactions<br/>
Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of<br/>
the face or throat). Instruct patients to seek immediate emergency help if these occur [see<br/>
Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].<br/>
Serious Skin Reactions<br/>
Advise patients to stop Ambator Diclofenac Patch immediately if they develop any type of rash and<br/>
to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].<br/>
Female Fertility<br/>
Advise females of reproductive potential who desire pregnancy that NSAIDs, including AMBATOR<br/>
DICLOFENAC PATCH, may be associated with a reversible delay in ovulation [see Use in Specific<br/>
Populations (8.3)]<br/>
Fetal Toxicity<br/>
Inform pregnant women to avoid use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch and other NSAIDs starting at 30<br/>
weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus [see<br/>
Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].<br/>
Avoid Concomitant Use of NSAIDs<br/>
Inform patients that the concomitant use of Ambator Diclofenac Patch with other NSAIDs or<br/>
salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of<br/>
gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions<br/>
(5.2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in "over the counter"<br/>
medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.<br/>
Use of NSAIDS and Low-Dose Aspirin<br/>
Inform patients not to use low-dose aspirin concomitantly with Ambator Diclofenac Patch until they<br/>
talk to their healthcare provider [see Drug Interactions (7)].<br/>
Eye Exposure<br/>
Instruct patients to avoid contact of Ambator Diclofenac Patch with the eyes and mucosa. Advise<br/>
patients that if eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and consult<br/>
a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].<br/>
Special Application Instructions<br/>
• Instruct patients that, if Ambator Diclofenac Patch begins to peel-off, the edges of the patch<br/>
may be taped down. If problems with adhesion persist, patients may overlay the patch with a mesh<br/>
netting sleeve, where appropriate (e.g. to secure patches applied to ankles, knees, or elbows). The<br/>
mesh netting sleeve (e.g. Curad® Hold Tite™, Surgilast® Tubular Elastic Dressing) must allow air to<br/>
pass through and not be occlusive (non-breathable).</p><p>• Instruct patients not to apply Ambator Diclofenac Patch to non-intact or damaged skin resulting<br/>
from any etiology e.g. exudative dermatitis, eczema, infected lesion, burns or wounds.<br/>
• Instruct patients not to wear a Ambator Diclofenac Patch when bathing or showering.<br/>
