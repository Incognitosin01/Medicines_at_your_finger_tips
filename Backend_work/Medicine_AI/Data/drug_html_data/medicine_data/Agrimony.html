The plant possesses a short rhizome and is supported by a firm, hairy stem. The basal leaves are arrayed in a rosette and they, as well as the alternate sessile stem leaves, are pinnate, serrate and glabrous. The flowers and fruit (achene) grow at the top of the stem in a long, terminal spike. Agrimony is common in grasslands throughout Europe. It is imported from Bulgaria, Hungary and the former Yugoslavia.Bisset 1994, Bunney 1984, USDA 2016 Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. is recognized as the relevant plant species of "Herba Agrimonia" in some countries,Li 2015, Pu 2016, Yu 2015 and a report suggests the chemical composition of Agrimonia procera Wallr. to also be equivalent to Agrimonia eupatoria L. as a valid source of Agrimoniae herba.Granica 2015</p><h2>History</h2><p>The name Agrimonia may have its origin in the Greek "agremone" which refers to plants which supposedly healed cataracts of the eye. The species name eupatoria relates to Mithradates Eupator, King of Pontus, who is credited with introducing many herbal remedies. Its ancient uses include treatment for catarrh (mucous membrane inflammation with discharge), bleeding, tuberculosis and skin diseases. 1984 In folk medicine, it has been reported, without verification, to be useful in gallbladder disorders. Numerous other reported uses include use as a dye, flavoring, gargle for performers and speakers, antitumor agent, astringent, cardiotonic, coagulant, diuretic, sedative, antiasthmatic and for corns or warts.Duke 2003 This plant is often included in phytomedicine mixtures for "liver and bile teas," again without true scientific verification. Agrimony extracts are often used in small amounts in prepared European cholagogues and stomach and bowel remedies (eg, Neo-Gallonorm-Dragees) and urological products (eg, Rhoival). Agrimony is also a component of the British product "Potter's Piletabs."Bisset 1994, Drozd 1983, Hoppe 1975, von Gizycki 1949</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>The aerial parts of the plant contain 4% to 10% condensed tannins, small amounts of ellagitannins and traces of gallotannins.Bisset 1994, von Gizycki 1949 Also reported are some 20% polysaccharides.von Gizycki 1949 A triterpenoid, ursolic acid, has been isolated. Silicic acid, traces of essential oil, and the flavonoids luteolin and apigenin 7-O-beta-D-glucosides are present.von Gizyck 1949 Organic acids, vitamin B<sub>1</sub>, vitamin K and ascorbic acid are also found. The fresh herb contains agrimoniolide, palmitic and stearic acids, ceryl alcohol and phytosterols. Seeds contain 35% oil which contains oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids.Bisset 1994, Duke 2003</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Cancer</h3><p>Cytotoxic effects of agrimony against cancer cell lines has been demonstrated in vitro.Ad’hiah 2013 Antioxidant potential of the phenolic content has been determined.Kuczmannová 2015, Yoon 2012</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data on the effect of agrimony in cancer; however, Herba Agrimonia (Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb.) has been used in China in combination with other natural products for the management of certain cancers (also called "Guan Chang Fu Fang").Li 2015, Pu 2016, Yu 2015</p><h1>Diabetes</h1><h1>Animal data</h1><p>Studies in rodents suggest chemical constituents of agrimony have hold potential in diabetes.Kuczmannová 2016, Wang 2016</p><h1>Clinical data</h1><p>Research reveals no clinical data on the effect of agrimony in diabetes; however, improved lipid profile and antioxidant status has been reported after 1 month’s consumption of agrimony tea in healthy volunteers in a small (n=19) study.Ivanova 2013</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There is limited published clinical evidence for a safe or effective dose.</p><p>200 mL boiled water was added to 1 g dried aerial parts of <i>A. eupatoria</i> and consumed twice a day for 1 month in a small study evaluating the effect on lipid profile and antioxidant status.Ivanova 2013</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Agrimony has been reported to produce photodermatitis in man.USDA 2016</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Research reveals little or no information regarding toxicology with the use of this product.</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
