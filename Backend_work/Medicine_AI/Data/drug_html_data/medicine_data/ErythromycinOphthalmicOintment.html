</ul><p class="First">Rx only</p><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First">Erythromycin Ophthalmic Ointment belongs to the macrolide group of antibiotics. It is basic and readily forms a salt when combined with an acid. The base, as crystals or powder, is slightly soluble in water, moderately soluble in ether, and readily soluble in alcohol or chloroform. Erythromycin ((3R*, 4S*, 5S*, 6R*, 7R*, 9R*, 11R*, 12R*, 13S*, 14R*)-4-[(2,6-dideoxy-3-C-methyl-3 <span class="Italics">O</span>-methyl-α-L-<span class="Italics">ribo</span>-hexopyranosyl)-oxy]-14-ethyl-7,12,13-trihydroxy- 3,5,7,9,11,13-hexamethyl-6-[[3,4,6-trideoxy-3-(dimethyl-amino)-β-D-<span class="Italics">xylo</span>-hexopyranosyl]oxy]oxacyclotetradecane-2,10-dione)) is an antibiotic produced from a strain of <span class="Italics">Streptomyces erythraeus.</span></p><p>It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Each gram contains Erythromycin USP 5 mg in a sterile ophthalmic base of mineral oil and white petrolatum.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Microbiology:</span> Erythromycin inhibits protein synthesis without affecting nucleic acid synthesis. Erythromycin is usually active against the following organisms <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections:</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">For the treatment of superficial ocular infections involving the conjunctiva and/or cornea caused by organisms susceptible to erythromycin.</p><p>For prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum due to <span class="Italics">N. gonorrhoeae</span> or <span class="Italics">C. trachomatis</span>.</p><p>The effectiveness of erythromycin in the prevention of ophthalmia caused by penicillinase-producing <span class="Italics">N.gonorrhoeae</span> is not established.</p><p>For infants born to mothers with clinically apparent gonorrhea, intravenous or intramuscular injections of aqueous crystalline penicillin G should be given; a single dose of 50,000 units for term infants or 20,000 units for infants of low birth weight. Topical prophylaxis alone is inadequate for these infants.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to erythromycin.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> The use of antimicrobial agents may be associated with the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi; in such a case, antibiotic administration should be stopped and appropriate measures taken.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information for Patients:</span> Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye, fingers, or other source.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> Two year oral studies conducted in rats with erythromycin did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted. No evidence of impaired fertility that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in animal studies.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span> Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats, mice, and rabbits using erythromycin and its various salts and esters, at doses that were several multiples of the usual human dose. No evidence of harm to the fetus that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in these studies. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, the erythromycins should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span> - See <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">The most frequently reported adverse reactions are minor ocular irritations, redness, and hypersensitivity reactions.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">In the treatment of superficial ocular infections, a ribbon approximately 1 cm in length of Erythromycin Opthalmic Ointment should be applied directly to the infected structure up to 6 times daily, depending on the severity of the infection.</p><p>For prophylaxis of neonatal gonococcal or chlamydial conjunctivitis, a ribbon of ointment approximately 1 cm in length should be instilled into each lower conjunctival sac. The ointment should not be flushed from the eye following instillation. A new tube should be used for each infant.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">Sterile Erythromycin Ophthalmic Ointment USP, 0.5% is available as follows:</p><p>3.5 g (1/8 oz) sterile tamper-resistant tube</p><p>(NDC 0404-7191-01)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">STORAGE:</span> Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p>Avoid excessive heat.</p><p>Protect from freezing.</p><p>Distributed by (in US only):<br/>
