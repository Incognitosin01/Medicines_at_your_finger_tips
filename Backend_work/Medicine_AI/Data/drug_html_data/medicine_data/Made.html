<br/>
Made® is a sterile solution Made with isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br/>
It is a homeopathic complex medicine and its active ingredients may be classified in 3 groups according to the starting material:<br/>
11.1.    Herbal and mineral remedies<br/>
11.2.    Enzymes and intermediates of the Krebs cycle<br/>
11.3.    Biological substrates.<br/>
The strengths of the homeopathic ingredients  are related to their physiological function,  as follows:<br/>
•    The attenuation of the herbal and mineral remedies have been selected in order to act as a detoxifier of the skin matrix<br/>
•    Enzymes and intermediates of the Krebs cycle at low attenuations stimulate the physiological mechanism of the cell respiration cycle.<br/>
•    The attenuation of the biological substrates act to target the organs and as supporters of the endogenous production of the structural components of skin tissue.<br/>
Made® shows a “flattening” effect on wrinkles, this improves as the protocol is continued; the effect  is   due  to improved metabolism in the  area of application not due to a filler effect.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">12.1.    Mechanism of Action<br/>
The medication acts through   a low-dose enzymatic mechanism. Due to the homeopathic nature of the active ingredients, receptors are not blocked due to saturation of their active sites, rather there is a feed back regulation of the physiological metabolism of collagen. As enzymes may be easily blocked due to different events (on-going diseases, aging, sun exposure, etc.) homeopathic dilutions of enzymatic substrates act as enzyme inducing tools.<br/>
12.2.    Pharmacodynamics<br/>
The physiological effects of Made® is  due to  the effects of the ingredients, according to their description in the Homeopathic Materia Medica.<br/>
In homeopathy there is no direct relationship between dose and effect, rather  there is a relationship between attenuation and balancing effect on biochemical pathways.<br/>
In Made® the attenuation of each ingredient has been selected in order to promote the biochemical pathways of collagen synthesis.<br/>
12.3.    Pharmacokinetics<br/>
The homeopathic attenuation  provides complete bioavability of the active ingredients. <br/>
<br/></p><h2>13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><p class="First">13.1.    Made® has no level of toxicity due to the attenuation of the ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">14.1.    One post-approval cohort clinical study has been performed according to the GCP. (1)<br/>
The study included 681 patients of both genders (578 female – 103 male) aged between 35 and 75 (female) and between 40 and 70 (male) without exclusion criteria and lasted 5 years from 1998 to 2003.<br/>
3.8% of the patients dropped out of the study for reasons that were not connected with the treatment.<br/>
The application consisted of linear infiltration of the wrinkle, utilizing  mesotherapy technique, or infiltration inside the wrinkle, utilizing the tunnelization technique.<br/>
Treatment consisted of 8 sessions on a weekly basis, then for some patients the treatment was continued as one session a month for 2-3 months.<br/>
The results were evaluated before and after the program via the subjective classification of the visual and tactile characteristics of the wrinkles and the slackening of the face and neck tissues.<br/>
Mild reactions to the treatment were only observed in 20 cases (3%) with slight erythema at the injection site, which disappeared after a few minutes.<br/>
Made®  proved to be highly effective with high levels of tolerability for all types of wrinkles and skin relaxation.<br/>
The best results were observed in female patients between 30-40 and 40-50 years old.<br/>
