It belongs to the group of medicines known as sulfonamide antibiotics. It works by preventing the growth of bacteria. However, sulfisoxazole will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Sulfisoxazole is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using sulfisoxazole</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For sulfisoxazole, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to sulfisoxazole or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Because of sulfisoxazole's toxicity, use in infants younger than 2 months of age is not recommended.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of sulfisoxazole in geriatric patients.

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using sulfisoxazole with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
