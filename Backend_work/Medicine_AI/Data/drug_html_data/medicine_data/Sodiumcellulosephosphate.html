It is used in patients whose bodies absorb too much calcium from their food.</p><p>Cellulose sodium phosphate works by combining with the calcium and some other minerals in food. This prevents the calcium from reaching the kidneys where the stones are formed.</p><p>Cellulose sodium phosphate is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using sodium cellulose phosphate</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of cellulose sodium phosphate in children with use in any other age group, its use is not recommended in children up to 16 years of age because of the increased need for calcium in growing children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people.
