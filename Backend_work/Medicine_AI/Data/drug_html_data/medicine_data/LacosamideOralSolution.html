</ul><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Lacosamide Oral Solution is indicated in patients 17 years and older with partial-onset seizures as adjunctive therapy.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">Lacosamide Oral Solution may be taken with or without food.</p><p>When using Lacosamide Oral Solution, it is recommended that a calibrated measuring device be obtained and used. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. Healthcare providers should recommend a device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and provide instructions for measuring the dosage.</p><h3>2.1 Dosage for Lacosamide Oral Solution</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adjunctive Therapy</span></p><p>The initial recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily (100 mg per day). Based on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose can be increased at weekly intervals by 50 mg twice daily (100 mg per day). The recommended maintenance dose is 100 mg twice daily to 200 mg twice daily (200 mg to 400 mg per day). In clinical trials, the 300 mg twice daily (600 mg per day) dose was not more effective than the 200 mg twice daily dose (400 mg per day), but was associated with a substantially higher rate of adverse reactions.</p><p>When discontinuing Lacosamide Oral Solution, a gradual withdrawal over at least 1 week is recommended [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>].</p><h3>2.3 Dosage Information in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. A maximum dose of 300 mg per day Lacosamide Oral Solution is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>) less than or equal to 30 mL/min] and in patients with endstage renal disease. Lacosamide Oral Solution is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, dosage supplementation of up to 50% should be considered. In all renally impaired patients, the dose titration should be performed with caution. Patients with renal impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have a significant increase in exposure to Lacosamide Oral Solution. Dose reduction may be necessary in these patients [s<span class="Italics">ee Use in Specific Populations (8.6), </span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>2.4 Dosage Information in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The dose titration should be performed with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. A maximum dose of 300 mg per day is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Lacosamide Oral Solution use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have a significant increase in exposure to Lacosamide Oral Solution. Dose reduction may be necessary in these patients [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), </span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>2.5 Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Lacosamide Oral Solution may be taken with or without food.</p><p><span class="Bold">Lacosamide Oral Solution</span></p><p>A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>5.1 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including lacosamide, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</p><p>Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Table 1 Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis</span></p><p class="First">Indication</p><p class="First">Placebo</p><p>Patients with</p><p>Events</p><p>Per 1000</p><p>Patients</p><p class="First">Drug Patients</p><p>with Events</p><p>Per 1000</p><p>Patients</p><p class="First">Relative Risk: Incidence of</p><p>Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo</p><p>Patients</p><p class="First">Risk</p><p>Difference: Additional</p><p>Drug Patients</p><p>with Events</p><p>Per 1000</p><p>Patients</p><p class="First">Epilepsy</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">3.4</p><p class="First">3.5</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">Psychiatric</p><p class="First">5.7</p><p class="First">8.5</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">2.9</p><p class="First">Other</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">Total</p><p class="First">2.4</p><p class="First">4.3</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar.</p><p>Anyone considering prescribing lacosamide or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which antiepileptics are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><h3>5.2 Dizziness and Ataxia</h3><p class="First">Lacosamide may cause dizziness and ataxia.</p><p>In patients with partial-onset seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs, dizziness was experienced by 25% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg per day) of lacosamide (compared with 8% of placebo patients) and was the adverse event most frequently leading to discontinuation (3%). Ataxia was experienced by 6% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg per day) of lacosamide (compared to 2% of placebo patients). The onset of dizziness and ataxia was most commonly observed during titration. There was a substantial increase in these adverse events at doses higher than 400 mg per day [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].</p><h3>5.3 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PR interval prolongation</span></p><p>Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies in patients and in healthy volunteers [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</span>]. In adjunctive clinical trials in patients with partial-onset epilepsy, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive lacosamide and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. In clinical trials in patients with diabetic neuropathy, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.5% (5/1023) of patients receiving lacosamide and 0% (0/291) of patients receiving placebo. Second degree and complete AV block have been reported in patients in pain studies and in patients with seizures. When lacosamide is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.</p><p>Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), sodium channelopathies (e.g., Brugada Syndrome), on concomitant medications that prolong PR interval, or with severe cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning lacosamide, and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended.</p><p><span class="Bold">Atrial fibrillation and Atrial flutter</span></p><p>In the short-term investigational trials of lacosamide in epilepsy patients, there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label epilepsy trials and in postmarketing experience. In patients with diabetic neuropathy, 0.5% of patients treated with lacosamide experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Lacosamide administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.</p><h3>5.4 Syncope</h3><p class="First">In the short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in epilepsy patients with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in patients with diabetic neuropathy, 1.2% of patients who were treated with lacosamide reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg per day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical epilepsy studies. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.</p><h3>5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)</h3><p class="First">As with all AEDs, lacosamide should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.</p><h3>5.6 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">One case of symptomatic hepatitis and nephritis was observed among 4011 subjects exposed to lacosamide during clinical development. The event occurred in a healthy volunteer, 10 days after stopping lacosamide treatment. The subject was not taking any concomitant medication and potential known viral etiologies for hepatitis were ruled out. The subject fully recovered within a month, without specific treatment. The case is consistent with a delayed multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction. Additional potential cases included 2 with rash and elevated liver enzymes and 1 with myocarditis and hepatitis of uncertain etiology.</p><p>Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as <span class="Bold">D</span>rug <span class="Bold">R</span>eaction with <span class="Bold">E</span>osinophilia and <span class="Bold">S</span>ystemic <span class="Bold">S</span>ymptoms, or DRESS) have been reported with other antiepileptics and typically, although not exclusively, present with fever and rash associated with other organ system involvement, that may or may not include eosinophilia, hepatitis, nephritis, lymphadenopathy, and/or myocarditis. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system signs and symptoms not noted here may occur. If this reaction is suspected, lacosamide should be discontinued and alternative treatment started.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>6.1 Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In the premarketing development of adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures, 1327 patients received lacosamide in controlled and uncontrolled trials, of whom 1000 were treated for longer than 6 months, and 852 for longer than 12 months.</p><p><span class="Bold">Lacosamide Oral Solution</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Adjunctive Therapy Controlled Trials (Studies 2, 3, and 4)</span></p><p>In adjunctive therapy controlled clinical trials, the rate of discontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 8% and 17% in patients randomized to receive lacosamide at the recommended doses of 200 and 400 mg per day, respectively, 29% at 600 mg per day, and 5% in patients randomized to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly (&gt;1% on lacosamide and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, diplopia, nausea, vertigo, and blurred vision.</p><p>Table 2 gives the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of adult patients with partial-onset seizures in the lacosamide total group and for which the incidence was greater

Elevations of ALT to ≥3× ULN occurred in 0.7% (7/935) of lacosamide patients and 0% (0/356) of placebo patients. One case of hepatitis with transaminases &gt;20x ULN occurred in one healthy subject 10 days after lacosamide treatment completion, along with nephritis (proteinuria and urine casts). Serologic studies were negative for viral hepatitis. Transaminases returned to normal within one month without specific treatment. At the time of this event, bilirubin was normal. The hepatitis/nephritis was interpreted as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to lacosamide.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated with lacosamide in all clinical trials in patients with partial-onset seizures, including controlled trials and long-term open-label extension trials. Adverse reactions addressed in other tables or sections are not listed here.</p><p>Blood and lymphatic system disorders: neutropenia, anemia</p><p>Cardiac disorders: palpitations</p><p>Ear and labyrinth disorders: tinnitus</p><p>Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, dyspepsia, dry mouth, oral hypoaesthesia</p><p>General disorders and administration site conditions: irritability, pyrexia, feeling drunk</p><p>Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: fall</p><p>Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms</p><p>Nervous system disorders: paresthesia, cognitive disorder, hypoaesthesia, dysarthria, disturbance</p><p>in attention, cerebellar syndrome</p><p>Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, mood altered, depressed mood</p><h3>6.2 Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lacosamide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Agranulocytosis</p><p>Psychiatric disorders: Aggression, agitation, hallucination, insomnia, psychotic disorder</p><p>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Angioedema, rash, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.</p><h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><h3>7.1 Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have a significant increase in exposure to lacosamide. Dose reduction may be necessary in these patients.</p><h3>7.2 Concomitant Medications that Prolong PR Interval</h3><p class="First">Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that prolong PR interval, because of a risk of AV block or bradycardia, e.g., beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning lacosamide, and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state, is recommended.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>Lacosamide produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and perinatal mortality, growth deficit) in rats following administration during pregnancy. Developmental neurotoxicity was observed in rats following administration during a period of postnatal development corresponding to the third trimester of human pregnancy. These effects were observed at doses associated with clinically relevant plasma exposures.</p><p>Lacosamide has been shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to interfere with the activity of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a protein involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. Potential related adverse effects on CNS development cannot be ruled out.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Lacosamide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Oral administration of  lacosamide to pregnant rats (20, 75, or 200 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis did not produce any teratogenic effects. However, the maximum doses evaluated were limited by maternal toxicity in both species and embryofetal death in rats. These doses were associated with maternal plasma lacosamide exposures [area under the plasma-time concentration curve; (AUC)] ≈2 and 1 times (rat and rabbit, respectively) that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg per day.</p><p>When lacosamide (25, 70, or 200 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to rats throughout gestation, parturition, and lactation, increased perinatal mortality and decreased body weights were observed in the offspring at the highest dose. The no-effect dose for pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity in rats (70 mg/kg/day) was associated with a maternal plasma lacosamide AUC approximately equal to that in humans at the MRHD.</p><p>Oral administration of lacosamide (30, 90, or 180 mg/kg/day) to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of postnatal development resulted in decreased brain weights and long-term neurobehavioral changes (altered open field performance, deficits in learning and memory). The early postnatal period in rats is generally thought to correspond to late pregnancy in humans in terms of brain development. The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats was associated with a plasma lacosamide AUC approximately 0.5 times that in humans at the MRHD.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Registry</span></p><p>Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking lacosamide enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.</p><h3>8.2 Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The effects of lacosamide on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. In a pre- and post-natal study in rats, there was a tendency for prolonged gestation in all lacosamide treated groups at plasma exposures (AUC) at or below the plasma AUC in humans at the maximum recommended human dose of 400 mg per day.</p><h3>8.3 Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Studies in lactating rats have shown that lacosamide and/or its metabolites are excreted in milk. It is not known whether lacosamide is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted into human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue lacosamide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of lacosamide in pediatric patients less than 17 years of age have not been established.</p><p>Lacosamide has been shown <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to interfere with the activity of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), a protein involved in neuronal differentiation and control of axonal outgrowth. Potential related adverse effects on CNS development cannot be ruled out. Administration of lacosamide to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of postnatal development resulted in decreased brain weights and long-term neurobehavioral changes (altered open field performance, deficits in learning and memory). The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats was associated with a plasma lacosamide exposure (AUC) approximately 0.5 times the human plasma AUC at the maximum recommended human dose of 400 mg per day.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">There were insufficient numbers of elderly patients enrolled in partial-onset seizure trials (n=18) to adequately assess the effectiveness of lacosamide in this population.</p><p>No lacosamide dose adjustment based on age is necessary. In elderly patients, dose titration should be performed with caution [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>8.6 Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">A maximum dose of 300 mg per day is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>≤30 mL/min) and in patients with endstage renal disease. Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Dosage supplementation of up to 50% following hemodialysis should be considered. In all renally impaired patients, dose titration should be performed with caution [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3), </span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>8.7 Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be observed closely during dose titration. A maximum dose of 300 mg per day is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide has not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment. Lacosamide use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4), </span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Patients with co-existing hepatic and renal impairment should be monitored closely during dose titration.</p><h2>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</h2><h3>9.1 Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Lacosamide is a Schedule V controlled substance.</p><h3>9.2 Abuse</h3><p class="First">In a human abuse potential study, single doses of 200 mg and 800 mg lacosamide produced euphoria-type subjective responses that differentiated statistically from placebo; at 800 mg, these euphoria-type responses were statistically indistinguishable from those produced by alprazolam, a Schedule IV drug. The duration of the euphoria-type responses following lacosamide was less than that following alprazolam. A high rate of euphoria was also reported as an adverse event in the human abuse potential study following single doses of 800 mg lacosamide (15% [5/34]) compared to placebo (0%) and in two pharmacokinetic studies following single and multiple doses of 300 to 800 mg lacosamide (ranging from 6% [2/33] to 25% [3/12]) compared to placebo (0%). However, the rate of euphoria reported as an adverse event in the lacosamide development program at therapeutic doses was less than 1%.</p><h3>9.3 Dependence</h3><p class="First">Abrupt termination of lacosamide in clinical trials with diabetic neuropathic pain patients produced no signs or symptoms that are associated with a withdrawal syndrome indicative of physical dependence. However, psychological dependence cannot be excluded due to the ability of lacosamide to produce euphoria-type adverse events in humans.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">There is limited clinical experience with lacosamide overdose in humans. The highest reported accidental overdose of lacosamide during clinical development was 1200 mg/day which was non-fatal. The types of adverse events experienced by patients exposed to supratherapeutic lacosamide doses during clinical trials were not clinically different from those of patients administered recommended doses of lacosamide. None were fatal.</p><p>There has been a single case of intentional overdose in a clinical trial by a patient who self-administered 12,000 mg lacosamide along with large doses of zonisamide, topiramate, and gabapentin. The patient presented in a coma with AV block, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was hospitalized. An EEG revealed epileptic waveforms. The patient recovered 2 days later.</p><p>In postmarketing experience, fatal cardiac arrest was reported following an acute overdose of 7,000 mg of lacosamide in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors; however, the case may have been confounded by the potential, but unproven, overdose of nicardipine. In postmarketing reports following single acute overdoses of 1,000 mg or greater of lacosamide, cardiac conduction disorders, confusion, decreased level of consciousness, and seizures (generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus) have been observed.</p><p>There is no specific antidote for overdose with lacosamide. Standard decontamination procedures should be followed. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of patient. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up to date information on the management of overdose with lacosamide.</p><p>Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of lacosamide (reduction of systemic exposure by 50% in 4 hours). Hemodialysis has not been performed in the few known cases of overdose, but may be indicated based on the patient's clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.</p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">The chemical name of lacosamide, the single (R)-enantiomer, is (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide (IUPAC). Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span> and its molecular weight is 250.30. The chemical structure is:</p><p>Lacosamide is a white to light yellow powder. It is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in acetonitrile and ethanol.</p><h3>11.3 Lacosamide Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Lacosamide Oral Solution contains 10 mg of lacosamide per mL. The inactive ingredients are acesulfame potassium, anhydrous citric acid, flavor, glycerin, methylparaben, polyethylene glycol, purified water, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium chloride and sorbitol solution. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may be added for adjustment of pH.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism by which lacosamide exerts its antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> electrophysiological studies have shown that lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg per day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>Electrocardiographic effects of lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg per day were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with t<span class="Sub">max</span>. The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at t<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg per day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg per day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg per day lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 87), adults with partial-onset seizures, adults with diabetic neuropathy, and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment.</p><p>Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect with a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. The maximum lacosamide plasma concentrations occur approximately 1 to 4 hour post-dose after oral dosing, and elimination half-life is approximately 13 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are dose proportional (100 to 800 mg) and time invariant, with low inter- and intra-subject variability. Compared to lacosamide the major metabolite, O-desmethyl metabolite, has a longer T<span class="Sub">max</span> (0.5 to 12 hours) and elimination half-life (15 to 23 hours).</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption and Bioavailability</span></p><p>Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption.</p><p>After intravenous administration, C<span class="Sub">max</span> is reached at the end of infusion. The 30- and 60-minute intravenous infusions are bioequivalent to the oral tablet.</p><p>In a trial comparing the oral tablet with an oral solution containing 10 mg/mL lacosamide, bioequivalence between both formulations was shown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The volume of distribution is approximately 0.6 L/kg and thus close to the volume of total body water. Lacosamide is less than 15% bound to plasma proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p>Lacosamide is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion and biotransformation.</p><p>After oral and intravenous administration of 100 mg [14C]-lacosamide approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces. The major compounds excreted were unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately 30%), and a structurally unknown polar fraction (~20%). The plasma exposure of the major human metabolite, O-desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately 10% of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.</p><p>The CYP isoforms mainly responsible for the formation of the major metabolite (O-desmethyl) are CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours and is not altered by different doses, multiple dosing or intravenous administration.</p><p>There is no enantiomeric interconversion of lacosamide.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Lacosamide and its major metabolite are eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion.</p><p>The AUC of lacosamide was increased approximately 25% in mildly (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> 50 to 80 mL/min) and moderately (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in severely (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>≤30 mL/min) renally impaired patients compared to subjects with normal renal function (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span>&gt;80 mL/min), whereas C<span class="Sub">max</span> was unaffected. Lacosamide is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. Following a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment, AUC of lacosamide is reduced by approximately 50 [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Lacosamide undergoes metabolism. Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) showed higher plasma concentrations of lacosamide (approximately 50% to 60% higher AUC compared to healthy subjects). The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have not been evaluated in severe hepatic impairment [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric</span></p><p>In the elderly (&gt;65 years), dose and body-weight normalized AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> is about 20% increased compared to young subjects (18 to 64 years). This may be related to body weight and decreased renal function in elderly subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gender</span></p><p>Lacosamide clinical trials indicate that gender does not have a clinically relevant influence on the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide.</p><p><span class="Italics">Race</span></p><p>There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between Asian, Black, and Caucasian subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">CYP2C19 Polymorphism</span></p><p>There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lacosamide between CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers. Results from a trial in poor metabolizers (PM) (N=4) and extensive metabolizers (EM) (N=8) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 showed that lacosamide plasma concentrations were similar in PMs and EMs, but plasma concentrations and the amount excreted into urine of the O-desmethyl metabolite were about 70% reduced in PMs compared to EMs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> metabolism studies indicate that lacosamide does not induce the enzyme activity of drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4. Lacosamide did not inhibit CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5 at plasma concentrations observed in clinical studies.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> data suggest that lacosamide has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 at therapeutic concentrations. However, an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> study with omeprazole did not show an inhibitory effect on omeprazole pharmacokinetics.</p><p>Lacosamide was not a substrate or inhibitor for P-glycoprotein.</p><p>Lacosamide is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 may have increased exposure to lacosamide.</p><p>Since &lt;15% of lacosamide is bound to plasma proteins, a clinically relevant interaction with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites is unlikely.</p><p><span class="Italics">In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions</span></p><ul class="Disc">

Mice and rats received lacosamide once daily by oral administration for 104 weeks at doses producing plasma exposures (AUC) up to approximately 1 and 3 times, respectively, the plasma AUC in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg per day.</p><p>Lacosamide was negative in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames test and an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay.

Enrolled patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization, and were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. During an 8-week baseline period, patients were required to have an average of ≥4 partial-onset seizures per 28 days with no seizure-free period exceeding 21 days. In these 3 trials, patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of 24 years and a median baseline seizure frequency ranging from 10 to 17 per 28 days. 84% of patients were taking 2 to 3 concomitant AEDs with or without concurrent vagal nerve stimulation.</p><p>Study 2 compared doses of lacosamide 200, 400, and 600 mg per day with placebo. Study 3 compared doses of lacosamide 400 and 600 mg per day with placebo. Study 4 compared doses of lacosamide 200 and 400 mg per day with placebo. In all three trials, following an 8-week baseline phase to establish baseline seizure frequency prior to randomization, subjects were randomized and titrated to the randomized dose (a 1-step back-titration of lacosamide 100 mg per day or placebo was allowed in the case of intolerable adverse events at the end of the titration phase). During the titration phase, in all 3 adjunctive therapy trials, treatment was initiated at 100 mg per day (50 mg twice daily), and increased in weekly increments of 100 mg per day to the target dose. The titration phase lasted 6 weeks in Study 2 and Study 3, and 4 weeks in Study 4. In all three trials, the titration phase was followed by a maintenance phase that lasted 12 weeks, during which patients were to remain on a stable dose of lacosamide.</p><p>A reduction in 28 day seizure frequency (baseline to maintenance phase), as compared to the placebo group, was the primary variable in all three adjunctive therapy trials. A statistically significant effect was observed with lacosamide treatment (Figure 1) at doses of 200 mg per day (Study 4), 400 mg per day (Studies 2, 3, and 4), and 600 mg per day (Studies 2 and 3).</p><p>Subset evaluations of lacosamide demonstrate no important differences in seizure control as a function of gender or race, although data on race was limited (about 10% of patients were non-Caucasian).</p><p> </p><p>Figure 2 presents the percentage of patients (X-axis) with a percent reduction in partial seizure frequency (responder rate) from baseline to the maintenance phase at least as great as that represented on the Y-axis. A positive value on the Y-axis indicates an improvement from baseline (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative value indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e., an increase in seizure frequency). Thus, in a display of this type, a curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in seizure frequency was consistently higher for the lacosamide groups, compared to the placebo group. For example, 40% of patients randomized to lacosamide (400 mg per day) experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, compared to 23% of patients randomized to placebo. Patients with an increase in seizure frequency &gt;100% are represented on the Y-axis as equal to or greater than -100%.</p><p> </p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">Lacosamide Oral Solution <span class="Bold">10 mg/mL</span> is a clear, colorless to yellow or yellow-brown, strawberry-flavored liquid.
