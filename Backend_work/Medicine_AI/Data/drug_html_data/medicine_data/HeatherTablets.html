</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rx only</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as Chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.</span></p><h2>Heather Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Each pale yellow HEATHER tablet provides a continuous oral contraceptive regimen of 0.35 mg norethindrone USP daily, and the inactive ingredients include corn starch, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, povidone, talc, D&amp;C Yellow No. 10 aluminum lake and FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 aluminium lake.</p><p>The chemical name for norethindrone USP is 17-Hydroxy-19-Nor-17α-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one. The structural formula follows:</p><p>Norethindrone USP</p><p><span class="Bold">Therapeutic class = oral contraceptive</span></p><h2>Heather Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>1. Mode of Action</h3><p class="First">HEATHER progestin-only oral contraceptives prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in approximately half of users, thickening the cervical mucus to inhibit sperm penetration, lowering the mid-cycle LH and FSH peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and altering the endometrium.</p><h3>2. Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Norethindrone is rapidly absorbed with maximum plasma concentrations occurring within 1 to 2 hours after HEATHER administration (see Table 1). Norethindrone appears to be completely absorbed following oral administration; however, it is subject to first pass metabolism resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 65%.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 1: Mean ± SD Norethindrone Plasma Concentrations Following HEATHER Administration</p><p>Peak plasma concentrations occur approximately 1 hour after administration (mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> 1.2 hours). The mean (SD) C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 4816.8 (1532.6) pg/mL and generally occurred within 1 hour (mean) of tablet administration, ranging from 0.5 to 2 hours. The mean (SD) C<span class="Sub">avg</span> was 885 (250) pg/mL, however, the mean concentration at 24 hrs was 130 (47) pg/mL.</p><p>Table 1 provides summary statistics of the pharmacokinetic parameters associated with single dose HEATHER administration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Parameter</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Norethindrone 0.35 mg</span></p><p class="First">T<span class="Sub">max</span> (hr)</p><p class="First">1.2 ± 0.5</p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span> (pg/mL)</p><p class="First">4817 ± 1533</p><p class="First">AUC<span class="Sub">(0-48)</span> (pg•h/mL)</p><p class="First">21233 ± 6002</p><p class="First">t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> (h)</p><p class="First">7.7 ± 0.5</p><p>The food effect on the rate and extent of norethindrone absorption after HEATHER administration has not been evaluated.</p><p class="First">Following oral administration, norethindrone is 36% bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and 61% bound to albumin. Volume of distribution of norethindrone is approximately 4 L/kg.</p><p class="First">Norethindrone undergoes extensive biotransformation, primarily via reduction, followed by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation; less than 5% of a norethindrone dose is excreted unchanged; greater than 50% and 20-40% of a dose is excreted in urine and feces, respectively. The majority of metabolites in the circulation are sulfate, with glucuronides accounting for most of the urinary metabolites.</p><p class="First">Plasma clearance rate for norethindrone has been estimated to be approximately 600 L/day. Norethindrone is excreted in both urine and feces, primarily as metabolites. The mean terminal elimination half-life of norethindrone following single dose administration of HEATHER is approximately 8 hours.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Heather Tablets</h2><h3>1. Indications</h3><p class="First">Progestin-only oral contraceptives are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy.</p><h3>2. Efficacy</h3><p class="First">If used perfectly, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is 0.5%. However, the typical failure rate is estimated to be closer to 5%, due to late or omitted pills. The following table lists the pregnancy rates for users of all major methods of contraception.</p><p class="First">% of Women Experiencing an Unintended Pregnancy within the First Year of Use</p><p class="First">% of Women Continuing Use at One Year‡</p><p class="First">Method</p><p>(1)</p><p class="First">Typical Use§</p><p>(2)</p><p class="First">Perfect Use¶</p><p>(3)</p><p class="First">(4)</p><p class="First">Chance#</p><p class="First">85</p><p class="First">85</p><p class="First">SpermicidesÞ</p><p class="First">26</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">Periodic abstinence</p><p class="First">25</p><p class="First">63</p><p class="First">Calendar</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">Ovulation Method</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">Sympto-Thermalß</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">Post-Ovulation</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">Capà</p><p class="First">Parous Women</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">26</p><p class="First">42</p><p class="First">Nulliparous Women</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">Sponge</p><p class="First">Parous Women</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">42</p><p class="First">Nulliparous Women</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">Diaphragmà</p><p class="First">20</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">Withdrawal</p><p class="First">19</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">Condomè</p><p class="First">Female (Reality)</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">Male</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">61</p><p class="First">Pill</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">71</p><p class="First">Progestin only</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">Combined</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">IUDs</p><p class="First">Progesterone T</p><p class="First">2.0</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">81</p><p class="First">Copper T 380A</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">78</p><p class="First">LNg 20</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">81</p><p class="First">Depo-Provera<span class="Sup">®</span></p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">70</p><p class="First">Levonorgestrel Implants (Norplant<span class="Sup">®</span>)</p><p class="First">0.05</p><p class="First">0.05</p><p class="First">88</p><p class="First">Female Sterilization</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">100</p><p class="First">Male Sterilization</p><p class="First">0.15</p><p class="First">0.10</p><p class="First">100</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Progestin-only oral contraceptives (POPs) should not be used by women who currently have the following conditions:</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.</span></p><p>HEATHER does not contain estrogen and, therefore, this insert does not discuss the serious health risks that have been associated with the estrogen component of combined oral contraceptives. The health care provider is referred to the prescribing information of combined oral contraceptives for a discussion of those risks, including, but not limited to, an increased risk of serious cardiovascular disease in women who smoke, carcinoma of the breast and reproductive organs, hepatic neoplasia, and changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The relationship between progestin-only oral contraceptives and these risks have not been established and there are no studies definitely linking progestin-only pill (POP) use to an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.</p><p>The physician should remain alert to the earliest manifestation of symptoms of any serious disease and discontinue oral contraceptive therapy when appropriate.</p><h3>1. Ectopic pregnancy</h3><p class="First">The incidence of ectopic pregnancies for progestin-only oral contraceptive users is 5 per 1000 woman-years. Up to 10% of pregnancies reported in clinical studies of progestin-only oral contraceptive users are extrauterine. Although symptoms of ectopic pregnancy should be watched for, a history of ectopic pregnancy need not be considered a contraindication to use of this contraceptive method. Health providers should be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain while on progestin-only oral contraceptives.</p><h3>2. Delayed follicular atresia/Ovarian cysts</h3><p class="First">If follicular development occurs, atresia of the follicle is sometimes delayed, and the follicle may continue to grow beyond the size it would attain in a normal cycle. Generally these enlarged follicles disappear spontaneously. Often they are asymptomatic; in some cases they are associated with mild abdominal pain. Rarely they may twist or rupture, requiring surgical intervention.</p><h3>3. Irregular genital bleeding</h3><p class="First">Irregular menstrual patterns are common among women using progestin-only oral contraceptives. If genital bleeding is suggestive of infection, malignancy or other abnormal conditions, such nonpharmacologic causes should be ruled out. If prolonged amenorrhea occurs, the possibility of pregnancy should be evaluated.</p><h3>4. Carcinoma of the breast and reproductive organs</h3><p class="First">Some epidemiologic studies of oral contraceptive users have reported an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer, particularly at a younger age and apparently related to duration of use. These studies have predominantly involved combined oral contraceptives and there is insufficient data to determine whether the use of POPs similarly increase the risk. Women with breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because the role of female hormone in breast cancer has not been fully determined.</p><p>Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations of women. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. There is insufficient data to determine whether the use of POPs increases the risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.</p><h3>5. Hepatic neoplasia.</h3><p class="First">Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with combined oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Rupture of benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies from Britain and the U.S. have shown as increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in combined oral contraceptive users. However, these cancers are rare. There is insufficient data to determine whether POPs increase the risk of developing hepatic neoplasia.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>1. General</h3><p class="First">Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as Chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.</p><h3>2. Physical examination and follow-up</h3><p class="First">It is considered good medical practice for sexually active women using oral contraceptives to have annual history and physical examinations. The physical examination may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician.</p><h3>3. Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism</h3><p class="First">Some users may experience slight deterioration in glucose tolerance, with increases in plasma insulin, but women with diabetes mellitus who use progestin-only oral contraceptives do not generally experience changes in their insulin requirements. Nonetheless, prediabetic and diabetic women in particular should be carefully monitored while taking POPs.</p><p>Lipid metabolism is occasionally affected in that HDL, HDL<span class="Sub">2</span>, and apolipoprotein A-I and A-II may be decreased; hepatic lipase may be increased. There is no effect on total cholesterol, HDL<span class="Sub">3</span>, LDL, or VLDL.</p><h3>4. Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Change in contraceptive effectiveness associated with co-administration of other products:</p><p class="First">Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are co-administered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin.</p><p class="First">Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of OC products may be affected with the co-administration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Health care providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information.</p><p class="First">Herbal products containing St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding.</p><h3>5. Interactions with laboratory tests</h3><p class="First">The following endocrine tests may be affected by progestin-only oral contraceptive use</p><h3>6. Carcinogenesis</h3><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> section</p><h3>7. Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Many studies have found no effects on fetal development associated with long-term use of contraceptive doses of oral progestins. The few studies of infant growth and development that have been conducted have not demonstrated significant adverse effects. It is nonetheless prudent to rule out suspected pregnancy before initiating any hormonal contraceptive use.</p><h3>8. Nursing mothers</h3><p class="First">Small amounts of progestin pass into the breast milk, resulting in steroid levels in infant plasma of 1-6% of the levels of maternal plasma. However, isolated post-market cases of decreased milk production have been reported in POPs. Very rarely, adverse effects in the infant/child have been reported, including jaundice.</p><h3>9. Fertility following discontinuation</h3><p class="First">The limited available data indicate a rapid return of normal ovulation and fertility following discontinuation of progestin-only oral contraceptives.</p><h3>10. Headache/Migraine</h3><p class="First">If you have a headache or a worsening migraine headache with a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent, or severe, this requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.</p><h3>11. Gastrointestinal</h3><p class="First">Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption resulting in decreased serum concentrations.</p><h3>12. Pediatric use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of HEATHER has been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>Information for the Patient</h3><p class="First">The following points should be discussed with prospective users before prescribing progestin-only oral contraceptives</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdosage, including ingestion by children.</p><h2>Heather Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, HEATHER must be taken exactly as directed. One tablet is taken every day, at the same time. Administration is continuous, with no interruption between pill packs. See <span class="Bold">PATIENT LABELING</span> for detailed instructions.</p><h2>How is Heather Tablets Supplied</h2><p class="First">HEATHER (Norethindrone tablets USP, 0.35 mg) are available in 28-tablet dispensers as pale yellow round, flat faced beveled edged, uncoated tablets with ‘303’ debossed on one side and ‘G’ on the other side (NDC 68462-303-29).</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature 20 to 25<span class="Sup">o</span>C (68 to 77<span class="Sup">o</span>F).</p><p class="First">Manufactured by:</p><p><span class="Bold">Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</span><br/>

Please read this leaflet before you begin to take your pills. It is meant to be used along with talking with your doctor or clinic.</p><p>Progestin-only pills are often called “POPs” or “the minipill”. POPs have less progestin than the combined birth control pill (or “the pill”) which contains both an estrogen and a progestin.</p><h3>HOW EFFECTIVE ARE POPS?</h3><p class="First">About 1 in 200 (0.5%) POPs users will get pregnant in the first year if they all take POPs perfectly (that is, on time, every day). About 1 in 20 (5%) “typical” POPs users (including women who are late taking pills or miss pills) gets pregnant in the first year of use. The following table will help you compare the efficacy of different methods.</p><p class="First">IUD: 1-2%</p><p class="First">Depo-Provera<span class="Sup">®</span> (injectable progesterone): 0.3%</p><p class="First">Norplant<span class="Sup">®</span> System (levonorgestrel implants): 0.1%</p><p class="First">Diaphragm with spermicides: 18%</p><p class="First">Spermicides alone: 21%</p><p class="First">Male condom alone: 12%</p><p class="First">Female condom alone: 21%</p><p class="First">Cervical cap:</p><p>Women who have never given birth : 18%</p><p>Women who have given birth : 36%</p><p class="First">Periodic abstinence: 20%</p><p class="First">No methods: 85%</p><h3>HOW DO POPS WORK?</h3><h3>YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE POPS</h3><h3>RISKS OF TAKING POPS</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> If you have sudden or severe pain in your lower abdomen or stomach area, you may have an ectopic pregnancy or an ovarian cyst. If this happens, you should contact your doctor or clinic immediately.</p><h3>SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES (STDS)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> POPs do not protect against getting or giving someone HIV (AIDS) or any other STD, such as Chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital warts or herpes.</p><h3>SIDE EFFECTS</h3><p class="First">If you are concerned about any of these side effects, check with your doctor or clinic.</p><h3>USING POPS WITH OTHER MEDICINES</h3><p class="First">Before taking a POP, inform your health care provider of any other medication, including over-the-counter medicine that you may be taking.</p><p>If you are taking medicines for seizures (epilepsy) or tuberculosis (TB), tell your doctor or clinic. These medicines can make POPs less effective:</p><p>Medicines for seizures:</p><p>Medicine for TB:</p><p>Before you begin any new medicines be sure your doctor or clinic knows you are taking birth control pills that contain a progestin.</p><h3>HOW TO TAKE POPS</h3><p class="First">1. Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period.</p><p>2. Place this day label strip on the tablet blister card over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) imprinted in the plastic.</p><p><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If the first day of your period is a Sunday, you can skip steps #1 and #2.</p><h3>IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER</h3><h3>STARTING POPS</h3><h3>IF YOU ARE LATE OR MISS TAKING YOUR POPS</h3><h3>IF YOU ARE BREASTFEEDING</h3><h3>IF YOU ARE SWITCHING PILLS</h3><h3>PREGNANCY WHILE ON THE PILL</h3><p class="First">If you become pregnant, or think you might be, stop taking POPs and contact your physician. Even though research has shown that POPs do not cause harm to the unborn baby, it is always best not to take any drugs or medicines that you don’t need when you are pregnant.</p><p>You should get a pregnancy test:</p><h3>WILL POPS AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO GET PREGNANT LATER?</h3><p class="First">If you want to become pregnant, simply stop taking POPs. POPs will not delay your ability to get pregnant.</p><h3>BREASTFEEDING</h3><p class="First">If you are breastfeeding, POPs will not affect the quality or amount of your breast milk or the health of your nursing baby. However, isolated cases of decreased milk production have been reported. If you suspect that you are not producing enough milk for your baby, contact your doctor or clinic.</p><h3>OVERDOSE</h3><p class="First">No serious problems have been reported when many pills were taken by accident, or even by a small child, so there is usually no reason to treat an overdose.</p><h3>OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS</h3><p class="First">Cigarette smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.</p><p>Diabetic women taking POPs do not generally require changes in the amount of insulin they are taking. However, your physician may monitor you more closely under these conditions.</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns, check with your doctor or clinic. You can also ask for the more detailed “professional package labeling” written for doctors and other health care providers.</p><h3>HOW TO STORE YOUR POPS</h3><p class="First">Store your POPs at controlled room temperature 20 - 25<span class="Sup">o</span>C (68 - 77<span class="Sup">o</span>F).</p><p><span class="Bold">Be certain to read new revisions of this leaflet.
