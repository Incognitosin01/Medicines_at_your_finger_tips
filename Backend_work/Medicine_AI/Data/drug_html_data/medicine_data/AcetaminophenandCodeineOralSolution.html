<span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see WARNINGS; Drug Interactions].</span></p><h2>Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is pharmacologically classified as an analgesic.</p><p>Acetaminophen, 4’‐hydroxyacetanilide, a slightly bitter, white, odorless, crystalline powder, is a non-opioid, non‐salicylate analgesic and antipyretic. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">8</span>H<span class="Sub">9</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span> M.W. 151.16</p><p>Codeine phosphate, 7,8-didehydro-4,5α-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6α-ol phosphate (1:1) (salt) hemihydrate, a white crystalline powder, is an opioid agonist. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span> • H<span class="Sub">3</span>PO<span class="Sub">4</span> • ½ H<span class="Sub">2</span>O M.W. = 406.37</p><p>Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution, USP 120 mg/12 mg per 5 mL, for oral administration, contains:</p><p>Acetaminophen ..... 120 mg</p><p>Codeine Phosphate .....12 mg</p><p>Alcohol ..... 7%</p><p><span class="Bold">INACTIVE INGREDIENTS</span></p><p>Artificial cherry flavor, citric acid, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, propylene glycol, purified water, saccharin sodium, sodium benzoate, and sucrose.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Codeine is an opioid agonist relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, but with a much weaker affinity than morphine. The analgesic properties of codeine have been speculated to come from its conversion to morphine, although the exact mechanism of analgesic action remains unknown.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic properties of acetaminophen is not established but is thought to involve central actions.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Codeine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Codeine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Codeine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Codeine produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Efficacy Relationships</span></p><p>The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of codeine for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing codeine plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>].</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The behavior of the individual components is described below.</p><p><span class="Bold">Codeine</span></p><p>Codeine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is rapidly distributed from the intravascular spaces to the various body tissues, with preferential uptake by parenchymatous organs such as the liver, spleen and kidney. Codeine crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk. The plasma concentration does not correlate with brain concentration or relief of pain. Codeine is about 7 to 25% bound to plasma proteins and does not accumulate in body tissues.</p><p>About 70 to 80% of the administered dose of codeine is metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid to codeine-6-glucuronide (C6G) and via O-demethylation to morphine (about 5 to 10%) and N-demethylation to norcodeine (about 10%) respectively. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B4 are the major enzymes mediating glucurodination of codeine to C6G. Cytochrome P450 2D6 is the major enzyme responsible for conversion of codeine to morphine and P450 3A4 is the major enzyme mediating conversion of codeine to norcodeine. Morphine and norcodeine are further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. The glucuronide metabolites of morphine are morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). Morphine and M6G are known to have analgesic activity in humans. The analgesic activity of C6G in humans is unknown. Norcodeine and M3G are generally not considered to possess analgesic properties.</p><p>The plasma half-life is about 2.9 hours. The elimination of codeine is primarily via the kidneys, and about 90% of an oral dose is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of dosing. The urinary secretion products consist of free and glucuronide conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (4%), and hydrocodone (1%). The remainder of the dose is excreted in the feces.</p><p>At therapeutic doses, the analgesic effect reaches a peak within 2 hours and persists between 4 and 6 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen</span></p><p>Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. A small fraction (10 to 25%) of acetaminophen is bound to plasma proteins. The plasma half-life is 1.25 to 3 hours, but may be increased by liver damage and following overdosage. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and involves three principal separate pathways: conjugation with glucuronide; conjugation with sulfate; and oxidation via the cytochrome, P450-dependent, mixed-function oxidase enzyme pathway to form a reactive intermediate metabolite, which conjugates with glutathione and is then further metabolized to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The principal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved appears to be CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as additional pathways. Approximately 85% of an oral dose appears in the urine within 24 hours of administration, most as the glucuronide conjugate, with small amounts of other conjugates and unchanged drug.</p><p>See <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span> for toxicity information.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain where treatment with an opioid is appropriate and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, even at recommended doses [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>], reserve acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics]:</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is contraindicated in:</p><p>Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>WARNINGS</h2><h3>Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL and confusion with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution of different concentrations, when prescribing, dispensing, and administering acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. A household teaspoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the risk of mistakenly using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, it is strongly recommended that caregivers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Health care providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution contains codeine, a Schedule V controlled substance. As an opioid, acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see <span class="Bold">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span>].</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, and monitor all patients receiving acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients</span>]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)</h3><p class="First">To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status [see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>]. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is essential [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>]. Overestimating the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of codeine.</p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>].</p><h3>Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Codeine and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children</h3><p class="First">Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine. Codeine is subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to an increased exposure to the active metabolite morphine. Based upon postmarketing reports, children less than 12 years old appear to be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine, particularly if there are risk factors for respiratory depression. For example, many reported cases of death occurred in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to its respiratory depressant effect.</p><p>Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:</p><p><span class="Italics">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution.</p><p><span class="Italics">CYP2D6 Genetic Variability: Ultra-rapid metabolizer</span></p><p>Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (e.g.,gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican).</p><p>These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) [see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>]. Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.</p><h3>Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes</h3><p class="First">The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, codeine, and the active metabolite, morphine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction</span></p><p>The concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors , such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents(e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations with subsequently greater metabolism by cytochrome P450 2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.</p><p>The concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor may result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via 2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels. This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</p><p>Follow patients receiving acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution are used in conjunction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>].</p><p>If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary or if a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider dosage reduction of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.</p><p>If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary or if a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage until stable drug effects are <span class="Bold">achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal (see</span> <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span><span class="Bold">).</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors</span></p><p>The concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with all cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine) may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations and a decrease in active metabolite morphine plasma concentration which could result in an analgesic efficacy reduction or symptoms of opioid withdrawal.</p><p>Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in codeine plasma concentration and an increase in active metabolite morphine plasma concentration which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression.</p><p>Follow patients receiving acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6.</p><p>If concomitant use with a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, follow the patient for signs of reduced efficacy or opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage. After stopping use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor, consider reducing the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage and follow the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression or sedation [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>].</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products.</p><p>The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.</p><p>Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>].</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients, Drug Interactions</span>].</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:</span></p><p>Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachetic, or Debilitated Patients:</span></p><p>Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</span>].</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution and when acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</span>]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, codeine’s active metabolite including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution may cause severe hypotension including hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. In patients with circulatory shock acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution may cause vasodilatation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution for patients with acetaminophen allergy [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers</span>].</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The administration of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution or other opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p><p>Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The codeine in acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution therapy.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span>]</p><p>Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>].</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution and know how they will react to the medication [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers</span>].</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).</p><p><span class="Bold">Medication Errors</span></p><p>Instruct patients how to measure and take the correct dose of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, and ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. A household teaspoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the risk of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, it is strongly recommended that caregivers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Healthcare providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage and when administering acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution to ensure the dose is measured and administered accurately [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p>If the prescribed concentration is changed, instruct patients on how to correctly measure the new dose to avoid errors which could result in accidental overdose and death.</p><p><span class="Bold">Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</span></p><p>Inform patients that the use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].

Advise caregivers of children 12 to 18 years of age receiving acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution to monitor for signs of respiratory depression [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants</span></p><p>Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Serotonin Syndrome</span></p><p>Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop.</p><p>Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">MAOI Interaction</span></p><p>Inform patients not to take acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Adrenal Insufficiency</span></p><p>Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Important Administration Instructions</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Important Discontinuation Instructions</span></p><p>In order to avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>]</p><p>Instruct patients how to properly take acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Maximum Daily Dose of Acetaminophen</span></p><p>Inform patients not to take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Advise patients to call their healthcare provider if they have taken more than the recommended dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypotension</span></p><p>Inform patients that acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS; Severe Hypotension</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Anaphylaxis</span></p><p>Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction, and if they develop signs of allergy such as a rash or difficulty breathing to stop taking acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution and seek medical attention. [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</span></p><p>Inform female patients of reproductive potential that prolonged use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</span></p><p>Inform female patients of reproductive potential that acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution can cause fetal harm and to inform the prescriber of a known or suspected pregnancy [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Lactation</span></p><p>Advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Nursing Mothers</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Inform patients that chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility.

The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, and can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p>Narcotic analgesics should be avoided during labor if delivery of a premature infant is anticipated. If the mother has received narcotic analgesics during labor, newborn infants should be observed closely for signs of respiratory depression. Resuscitation may be required [see <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>]. The effect of codeine, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Codeine and its active metabolite, morphine, are present in human milk. There are published studies and cases that have reported excessive sedation, respiratory depression, and death in infants exposed to codeine via breast milk. Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine achieve higher than expected serum levels of morphine, potentially leading to higher levels of morphine in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants. In women with normal codeine metabolism (normal CYP2D6 activity), the amount of codeine secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent.</p><p>There is no information on the effects of the codeine on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effect on nursing infants is not known.

In most of the reported cases, these events followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 or high morphine concentrations). Children with sleep apnea may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.</p><p>Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death:</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and central nervous system depression [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p>These drugs are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc. at 1-800-262-9010 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or <span class="Italics">www.fda.gov/medwatch</span>.</p><p>The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><p>The following adverse reactions associated with the use of codeine were identified in postmarketing reports.

Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see WARNINGS].</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution</span></p><p>Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution is for oral use only. Abuse of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent use of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.</p><p>Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</p><p>When discontinuing acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS</span>]</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy</span>].</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from codeine or acetaminophen.</p><h3>Clinical Presentation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Codeine</span></p><p>Acute overdosage with codeine can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen</span></p><p>Dose-dependent, potentially fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious adverse effect of acetaminophen. Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and coagulation defects may also occur.</p><p>Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include; anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, pallor and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.</p><h3>Treatment of Overdose</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Codeine</span></p><p>In case of codeine overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or serious arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to codeine overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen</span></p><p>Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal should be administered just prior to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease systemic absorption if acetaminophen ingestion is known or suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation.</p><p>Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving liver injury is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.</p><p>Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe intoxication. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose-dependent and occurs early in the course of intoxication.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</span></p><p>Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, and with other acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solutions of different concentrations, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume.</p><p>Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the risk of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, it is strongly recommended that caregivers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Health care providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution and adjust the dosage accordingly [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Initial Dosage</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Initiating Treatment with Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution</span></p><p>Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg are associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions and are not associated with greater efficacy.</p><p>Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution contains 120 mg of acetaminophen and 12 mg of codeine phosphate per 5 mL (teaspoonful) and is given orally.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>15 mL (1 tablespoonful) every 4 hours as needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Opioids to Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution</span></p><p>There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</span></p><p>Individually titrate acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see WARNINGS]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.</p><p>If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution</span></span></p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</p><p>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</p><p>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on acetaminophen and codeine phosphate oral solution who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g. no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</p><p>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</p><p>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</span>].</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution, USP is supplied in in 16 fl oz bottles, and 5 mL unit dose, 10 mL unit dose, 12.5 mL unit dose and 15 mL unit dose in tray of ten cups.</p><p><span class="Bold">STORAGE</span></p><p>Store at 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p>Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container with a child-resistance closure.</p><p>Store Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution securely and dispose of properly [see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients</span>].</p><p>Manufactured by:</p><p>Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc.</p><p>Amityville, NY 11701</p><p>Rev.079:14 09/19</p><h2>Medication Guide</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MEDICATION GUIDE</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate (a seet’ a min’ oh fen and koe’ deen fos’fate)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Oral Solution,</span> <span class="Bold"></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution is:</span></p><p class="First">Important information about Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Important Information Guiding Use in Pediatric Patients:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Do not take Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution if you have:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Before taking Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution, tell your healthcare provider if you have a history of:</span></p><p>Have been told by your healthcare provider that you are a “rapid metabolizer” of certain medicines.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tell your healthcare provider if you are:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">When taking Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">While taking Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution DO NOT:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The possible side effects of Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Get emergency medical help if you have:</span></p><p>These are not all the possible side effects of Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Oral Solution.
