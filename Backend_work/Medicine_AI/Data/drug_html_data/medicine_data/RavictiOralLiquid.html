</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ravicti Oral Liquid</h2><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">RAVICTI is indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) who cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone. RAVICTI must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (e.g., essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, protein-free calorie supplements).</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>RAVICTI is not indicated for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia in patients with UCDs because more rapidly acting interventions are essential to reduce plasma ammonia levels.</li>
<li>The safety and efficacy of RAVICTI for the treatment of <span class="Italics">N</span>-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency has not been established.</li>
</ul><h2>Ravicti Oral Liquid Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">RAVICTI should be prescribed by a physician experienced in the management of UCDs.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Instruct patients to take RAVICTI with food or formula and to administer directly into the mouth via oral syringe or dosing cup.</li>
<li>Instruct that RAVICTI should be administered just prior to breastfeeding in infants who are breastfeeding.</li>
<li>For patients who cannot swallow, see the instructions on administration of RAVICTI by nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</li>
<li>For patients who require a volume of less than 1 mL per dose via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, the delivered dose may be less than anticipated. Closely monitor these patients using ammonia levels <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</li>
<li>The recommended dosages for patients switching from sodium phenylbutyrate to RAVICTI and patients naïve to phenylbutyric acid are different <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]</span>. For both subpopulations:
<ul class="Circle">
<li>Patients 2 years of age and older: Give RAVICTI in 3 equally divided dosages, each rounded up to the nearest 0.5 mL</li>
<li>Patients less than 2 years: Give RAVICTI in 3 or more equally divided dosages, each rounded up to the nearest 0.1 mL.</li>
<li>The maximum total daily dosage is 17.5 mL (19 g).</li>
<li>RAVICTI must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (e.g., essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, protein-free calorie supplements).</li>

</ul><h3>Switching From Sodium Phenylbutyrate to RAVICTI</h3><p class="First">Patients switching from sodium phenylbutyrate to RAVICTI should receive the dosage of RAVICTI that contains the same amount of phenylbutyric acid. The conversion is as follows:</p><p><span class="Italics">Total daily dosage of RAVICTI (mL) = total daily dosage of sodium phenylbutyrate tablets (g) × 0.86</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Total daily dosage of RAVICTI (mL) = total daily dosage of sodium phenylbutyrate powder (g) × 0.81</span></p><h3>Initial Dosage in Phenylbutyrate-Naïve Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage range, based upon body surface area, in patients naïve to phenylbutyrate (PBA) is 4.5 to 11.2 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day (5 to 12.4 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). For patients with some residual enzyme activity who are not adequately controlled with protein restriction, the recommended starting dosage is 4.5 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.</p><p>In determining the starting dosage of RAVICTI in treatment-naïve patients, consider the patient's residual urea synthetic capacity, dietary protein requirements, and diet adherence. Dietary protein is approximately 16% nitrogen by weight. Given that approximately 47% of dietary nitrogen is excreted as waste and approximately 70% of an administered PBA dose will be converted to urinary phenylacetylglutamine (U-PAGN), an initial estimated RAVICTI dose for a 24-hour period is 0.6 mL RAVICTI per gram of dietary protein ingested per 24-hour period. The total daily dosage should not exceed 17.5 mL.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment and Monitoring</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">During treatment with RAVICTI, patients should be followed clinically and with plasma ammonia levels to determine the need for dosage titration. Closely monitor plasma ammonia levels during treatment with RAVICTI and when changing the dosage of RAVICTI.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The methods used for measuring plasma ammonia levels vary among individual laboratories and values obtained using different assay methods may not be interchangeable. Normal ranges and therapeutic target levels for plasma ammonia depend upon the assay method used by the individual laboratory. During treatment with RAVICTI, refer to the assay-specific normal ranges and to the therapeutic target ranges for plasma ammonia.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Normal Plasma Ammonia</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In patients treated with RAVICTI who experience neurologic symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, headache, somnolence or confusion) in the absence of high plasma ammonia or other intercurrent illness to explain these symptoms, consider reducing the RAVICTI dosage and clinically monitor patients for potential neurotoxicity from high phenylacetate (PAA) concentrations. If available, obtain measurements of plasma PAA concentrations and plasma phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) to calculate the ratio of plasma PAA to PAGN which may help to guide RAVICTI dosing. The PAA to PAGN ratio has generally been less than 1 in patients with UCDs who did not have significant plasma PAA accumulation. In general, a high PAA to PAGN ratio may indicate a slower or less efficient conjugation reaction to form PAGN, which may lead to increases in PAA without further conversion to PAGN <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Elevated Plasma Ammonia</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In patients 6 years and older, when plasma ammonia is elevated, increase the RAVICTI dosage to maintain fasting plasma ammonia to less than half the upper limit of normal (ULN). In infants and pediatric patients below 6 years of age, if obtaining fasting ammonia is problematic due to frequent feedings, adjust the RAVICTI dosage to keep the first ammonia of the morning below the ULN for age. If available, the ratio of PAA to PAGN in the same plasma sample may provide additional information to assist in dosage adjustment decisions <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Dietary Protein Intake</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">If available, urinary phenylacetylglutamine (U-PAGN) measurements may be used to help guide RAVICTI dosage adjustment. Each gram of U-PAGN excreted over 24 hours covers waste nitrogen generated from 1.4 grams of dietary protein. If U-PAGN excretion is insufficient to cover daily dietary protein intake and the fasting ammonia is greater than half the ULN, the RAVICTI dosage should be increased. The amount of dosage adjustment should factor in the amount of dietary protein that has not been covered, as indicated by the 24-hour U-PAGN output, and the estimated RAVICTI dose needed per gram of dietary protein ingested and the maximum total daily dosage (i.e., 17.5 mL).</span></p><p>Consider a patient's use of concomitant medications, such as probenecid, when making dosage adjustment decisions based on U-PAGN. Probenecid may result in a decrease of the urinary excretion of PAGN <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dosage is at the lower end of the recommended dosing range (4.5 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day) and the dosage should be kept at the lowest necessary to control the patient's plasma ammonia <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Preparation for Nasogastric Tube or Gastrostomy Tube Administration</h3><p class="First">It is recommended that all patients who can swallow take RAVICTI orally, even those with nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tubes. However, for patients who cannot swallow, a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube may be used to administer RAVICTI as follows:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Utilize an oral syringe to withdraw the prescribed dosage of RAVICTI from the bottle.</li>
<li>Place the tip of the syringe into the nasogastric/gastrostomy tube.</li>
<li>Utilizing the plunger of the syringe, administer RAVICTI into the tube.</li>
<li>Flush once with 10 mL of water or formula and allow the flush to drain.</li>
<li>If needed, flush a second time with an additional 10 mL of water or formula to clear the tube.</li>
</ul><p>For patients who require a volume of less than 1 mL per dose via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, the delivered dosage may be less than anticipated due to adherence of RAVICTI to the plastic tubing. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored using ammonia levels following initiation of RAVICTI dosing or dosage adjustments.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oral liquid: colorless to pale yellow, 1.1 g/mL of glycerol phenylbutyrate (delivers 1.02 g/mL of phenylbutyrate).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">RAVICTI is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to phenylbutyrate. Signs of hypersensitivity include wheezing, dyspnea, coughing, hypotension, flushing, nausea, and rash.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Neurotoxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Increased exposure to PAA, the major metabolite of RAVICTI, may be associated with neurotoxicity in patients with UCDs. In a study of adult cancer patients, subjects received sodium phenylacetate administered as a 1-hour infusion twice daily at two dose levels of 125 and 150 mg/kg for a 2-week period. Of 18 subjects enrolled, 7 had a history of primary central nervous system tumor. Signs and symptoms of potential PAA neurotoxicity, which were reversible, were reported at plasma PAA concentrations above 500 micrograms/mL and included somnolence, fatigue, lightheadedness, headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, disorientation, impaired memory, and exacerbation of preexisting neuropathy. PAA concentrations were not measured when symptoms resolved.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In healthy subjects, after administration of 4 mL and 6 mL RAVICTI 3 times daily (13.2 g/day and 19.8 g/day, respectively) for 3 days, a dose-dependent increase in non-serious nervous system adverse reactions were observed. In subjects who had nervous system adverse reactions, plasma PAA concentrations, which were measured on Day 3 per protocol and not always at onset of symptoms, ranged from 8 to 56 micrograms/mL with 4 mL RAVICTI 3 times daily and from 31 to 242 micrograms/mL with 6 mL RAVICTI 3 times daily.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In clinical trials in patients with UCDs who had been on sodium phenylbutyrate prior to administration of RAVICTI, adverse reactions of headache, fatigue, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, seizures, tremor and/or dizziness were reported. No correlation between plasma PAA concentration and neurologic symptoms was identified but plasma PAA concentrations were generally not consistently measured at the time of neurologic symptom occurrence <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">If symptoms of vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence or confusion are present in the absence of high ammonia or other intercurrent illness which explains these symptoms, consider the potential for PAA neurotoxicity which may need reduction in the RAVICTI dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Pancreatic Insufficiency or Intestinal Malabsorption</h3><p class="First">Exocrine pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze RAVICTI in the small intestine, separating the active moiety, phenylbutyrate, from glycerol. This process allows phenylbutyrate to be absorbed into the circulation. Low or absent pancreatic enzymes or intestinal disease resulting in fat malabsorption may result in reduced or absent digestion of RAVICTI and/or absorption of phenylbutyrate and reduced control of plasma ammonia. Monitor ammonia levels closely in patients with pancreatic insufficiency or intestinal malabsorption.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>Assessment of adverse reactions was based on exposure of 45 adult patients (31 female and 14 male) with UCD subtype deficiencies of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC, n=40), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS, n=2), and argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS, n=1) in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled (RAVICTI vs sodium phenylbutyrate), crossover, 4-week study (Study 1) that enrolled patients 18 years of age and older <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>. One of the 45 patients received only sodium phenylbutyrate prior to withdrawing on day 1 of the study due to an adverse reaction.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 10% of patients) reported during short-term treatment with RAVICTI were diarrhea, flatulence, and headache. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions occurring in 2 or more patients treated with RAVICTI or sodium phenylbutyrate (incidence of at least 4% in either treatment arm).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>RAVICTI has been evaluated in 77 patients with UCDs (51 adult and 26 pediatric patients ages 2 years to 17 years) in 2 open-label long-term studies, in which 69 patients completed 12 months of treatment with RAVICTI (median exposure = 51 weeks). During these studies there were no deaths.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of adult patients were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dizziness, headache, and fatigue.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of pediatric patients ages 2 years to 17 years were upper abdominal pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and headache.</p><p>RAVICTI has been evaluated in 17 patients with UCDs ages 2 months to less than 2 years in 3 open-label studies. The median exposure was 6 months (range 0.2 to 20 months). Adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 2 years were neutropenia, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, pyrexia, hypophagia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, rash, and papule.</p><p>RAVICTI has been evaluated in 16 patients with UCDs less than 2 months of age (age range 0.1 to 2 months, median age 0.5 months) in a single, open-label study. The median exposure was 10 months (range 2 to 20 months). Adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of pediatric patients aged less than 2 months were vomiting, rash, gastroesophageal reflux, increased hepatic enzymes, feeding disorder (decreased appetite, hypophagia), anemia, cough, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphocytosis, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation, pyrexia, lethargy, and irritability/agitation.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of RAVICTI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Abnormal body odor, including from skin, hair and urine</li>
<li>Retching and gagging</li>
<li>Dysgeusia or burning sensation in mouth</li>
</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Ammonia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Corticosteroids</span></p><p>Use of corticosteroids may cause the breakdown of body protein and increase plasma ammonia levels. Monitor ammonia levels closely when corticosteroids and RAVICTI are used concomitantly.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Valproic Acid and Haloperidol</span></p><p>Hyperammonemia may be induced by haloperidol and by valproic acid. Monitor ammonia levels closely when use of valproic acid or haloperidol is necessary in patients with UCDs.</p><h3>Potential for Other Drugs to Affect RAVICTI</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Probenecid</span></p><p>Probenecid may inhibit the renal excretion of metabolites of RAVICTI including PAGN and PAA.</p><h3>Potential for RAVICTI to Affect Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs with narrow therapeutic index that are substrates of CYP3A4</span></p><p>RAVICTI is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 in humans. Concomitant use of RAVICTI may decrease the systemic exposure to drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4. Monitor for decreased efficacy of drugs with narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, quinidine, cyclosporine) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Midazolam</span></p><p>Concomitant use of RAVICTI decreased the systemic exposure of midazolam. Monitor for suboptimal effect of midazolam in patients who are being treated with RAVICTI.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to RAVICTI during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report any prenatal exposure to RAVICTI by calling the Pregnancy Registry at 1-855-823-2595 or visiting www.ucdregistry.com.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited available data with RAVICTI use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In an animal reproduction study, administration of oral glycerol phenylbutyrate to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2.7–times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients resulted in maternal toxicity, but had no effects on embryo-fetal development. In addition, there were no adverse developmental effects with administration of oral glycerol phenylbutyrate to pregnant rats during organogenesis at 1.9 times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients; however, maternal toxicity, reduced fetal weights, and variations in skeletal development were observed in pregnant rats administered oral glycerol phenylbutyrate during organogenesis at doses greater than or equal to 5.7 times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Data]</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Oral administration of glycerol phenylbutyrate during the period of organogenesis up to 350 mg/kg/day in rabbits produced maternal toxicity, but no effects on embryo-fetal development. The dose of 350 mg/kg/day in rabbits is approximately 2.7 times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients, based on combined area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUCs] for PBA and PAA. In rats, at an oral dose of 300 mg/kg/day of glycerol phenylbutyrate (1.9 times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients, based on combined AUCs for PBA and PAA) during the period of organogenesis, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed. Doses of 650 mg/kg/day or greater produced maternal toxicity and adverse effects on embryo-fetal development including reduced fetal weights and cervical ribs at the 7th cervical vertebra. The dose of 650 mg/kg/day in rats is approximately 5.7 times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients, based on combined AUCs for PBA and PAA. No developmental abnormalities, effects on growth, or effects on learning and memory were observed through maturation of offspring following oral administration in pregnant rats with up to 900 mg/kg/day of glycerol phenylbutyrate (8.5 times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients, based on combined AUCs for PBA and PAA) during organogenesis and lactation.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of RAVICTI in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including neurotoxicity and tumorigenicity in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with RAVICTI.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients 2 Years to 17 Years of Age</span></p><p>The safety and effectiveness of RAVICTI in patients 2 years to less than 18 years of age have been established in 3 clinical studies: 2 open-label, fixed-sequence, switchover clinical studies from sodium phenylbutyrate to RAVICTI, and 1 long-term, open label safety study <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients Less Than 2 Years of Age</span></p><p>The safety and effectiveness of RAVICTI in patients with UCDs less than 2 years of age have been established in 3 open-label studies. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (plasma ammonia), and safety were studied in 17 patients aged 2 months to less than 2 years of age and in 16 patients less than 2 months of age <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span></p><p>In a juvenile rat study with daily oral dosing performed on postpartum day 2 through mating and pregnancy after maturation, terminal body weight was dose-dependently reduced by up to 16% in males and 12% in females at 900 mg/kg/day or higher (3 times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients, based on combined AUCs for PBA and PAA). Learning, memory, and motor activity endpoints were not affected. However, fertility (number of pregnant rats) was decreased by up to 25% at 650 mg/kg/day or higher (2.6 times the dose of 6.87 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day in adult patients, based on combined AUCs for PBA and PAA).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of RAVICTI did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The efficacy and safety of RAVICTI in patients with renal impairment are unknown. Monitor ammonia levels closely when starting patients with impaired renal function on RAVICTI.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No studies were conducted in patients with UCDs and hepatic impairment. Because conversion of PAA to PAGN occurs in the liver, patients with hepatic impairment may have reduced conversion capability and higher plasma PAA and PAA to PAGN ratio <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Therefore, dosage for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment should be started at the lower end of the recommended dosing range and should be kept on the lowest dose necessary to control their ammonia levels <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">While there is no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials, PAA, a toxic metabolite of RAVICTI, can accumulate in patients who receive an overdose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.</p><h2>Ravicti Oral Liquid Description</h2><p class="First">RAVICTI (glycerol phenylbutyrate) is a clear, colorless to pale yellow oral liquid. It is insoluble in water and most organic solvents, and it is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and greater than 65% acetonitrile.</p><p>Glycerol phenylbutyrate is a nitrogen-binding agent. It is a triglyceride containing 3 molecules of PBA linked to a glycerol backbone, the chemical name of which is benzenebutanoic acid, 1′, 1′ ′ –(1,2,3-propanetriyl) ester with a molecular weight of 530.67. It has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">33</span>H<span class="Sub">38</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>. The structural formula is:</p><h2>Ravicti Oral Liquid - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">UCDs are inherited deficiencies of enzymes or transporters necessary for the synthesis of urea from ammonia (NH<span class="Sub">3</span>, NH<span class="Sub">4</span><span class="Sup">+</span>). Absence of these enzymes or transporters results in the accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the blood and brain of affected patients. RAVICTI is a triglyceride containing 3 molecules of PBA. PAA, the major metabolite of PBA, is the active moiety of RAVICTI. PAA conjugates with glutamine (which contains 2 molecules of nitrogen) via acetylation in the liver and kidneys to form PAGN, which is excreted by the kidneys (Figure 1). On a molar basis, PAGN, like urea, contains 2 moles of nitrogen and provides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: RAVICTI Mechanism of Action</span></p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacological Effects</span></p><p>In clinical studies, total 24-hour area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ammonia levels was comparable at steady state during the switchover period between RAVICTI and sodium phenylbutyrate <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>The effect of multiple doses of RAVICTI 13.2 g/day and 19.8 g/day (approximately 69% and 104% of the maximum recommended daily dosage) on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg), four-treatment-arm, crossover study in 57 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc, based on individual correction method (QTcI) for RAVICTI, was below 10 ms.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>RAVICTI is a pro-drug of PBA. Upon oral ingestion, PBA is released from the glycerol backbone in the gastrointestinal tract by lipases. PBA derived from RAVICTI is further converted by β-oxidation to PAA.</p><p>In healthy, fasting adult subjects receiving a single oral dose of 2.9 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of RAVICTI, peak plasma levels of PBA, PAA, and PAGN occurred at 2 hours, 4 hours, and 4 hours, respectively. Upon single-dose administration of RAVICTI, plasma concentrations of PBA were quantifiable in 15 of 22 participants at the first sample time postdose (0.25 hours). Mean maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) for PBA, PAA, and PAGN was 37.0 micrograms/mL, 14.9 micrograms/mL, and 30.2 micrograms/mL, respectively. In healthy subjects, intact glycerol phenylbutyrate was detected in plasma.

Median age at enrollment was 0.5 months (range: 0.1 to 2 months). Eight patients had OTC deficiency, 7 patients had ASS deficiency, and 1 patient had ASL deficiency. Ten of the 16 patients transitioned from sodium phenylbutyrate to RAVICTI within 3 days of treatment and their initial dosage of RAVICTI was calculated to deliver the same amount of phenylbutyrate as the sodium phenylbutyrate dosage administered prior to RAVICTI dosing. Three of the 16 patients were treatment-naïve and started RAVICTI at dosages of 9, 9.4, and 9.6 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. The remaining 3 of the 16 patients transitioned from intravenous sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate to RAVICTI within 3 days of treatment and their initial dosages of RAVICTI were 10.4, 10.9, and 10.9 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.</p><p>Of the 16 patients, 16, 14, 12, 6, and 3 patients were treated for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively.</p><p>After the initial 7-day transition period, patients received a mean RAVICTI dosage of 8 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day (8.8 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), with doses ranging from 3.1 to 12.7 mL/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day (3.4 to 14 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). The frequency of dosing varied throughout the study. The majority of patients were dosed three times per day with feeding. No patients discontinued during the 7-day transition phase. Ammonia values across different laboratories were normalized (transformed) to a common normal pediatric range of 28 to 57 micromol/L for comparability.</p><p>During the safety extension phase (months 1-24), venous ammonia levels were monitored monthly for the first 6 months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter until the patients terminated or completed the study. During the safety extension phase, 1 patient discontinued from the study due to an adverse event (increased hepatic enzymes), 2 patients were withdrawn from the study by their parent/guardian, and 4 patients discontinued from the study early to undergo a liver transplant (protocol-defined discontinuation criterion). The normalized ammonia levels in pediatric patients with available values (which varied by month of treatment) in Study 6 in patients less than 2 months of age are shown in Table 4.</p><p>Five patients (all less than 1 month of age) experienced a total of 7 hyperammonemic crises defined as in Study 4/4E and 5. Hyperammonemic crises were precipitated by upper respiratory tract infection (2 events), change in diet (1 event), or had no identified precipitating event (4 events).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">RAVICTI<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> (glycerol phenylbutyrate) oral liquid 1.1 g/mL is supplied in multi-use, 25-mL glass bottles.
