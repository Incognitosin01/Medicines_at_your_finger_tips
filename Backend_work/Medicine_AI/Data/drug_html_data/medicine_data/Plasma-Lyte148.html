</ul><h2>Plasma-Lyte 148 Description</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) is a sterile, nonpyrogenic isotonic solution in a single dose container for intravenous administration. Each 100 mL contains 526 mg of Sodium Chloride, USP (NaCl); 502 mg of Sodium Gluconate (C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>NaO<span class="Sub">7</span>); 368 mg of Sodium Acetate Trihydrate, USP (C<span class="Sub">2</span>H<span class="Sub">3</span>NaO<span class="Sub">2</span>•3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O); 37 mg of Potassium Chloride, USP (KCl); and 30 mg of Magnesium Chloride, USP (MgCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•6H<span class="Sub">2</span>O). It contains no antimicrobial agents. The pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid. The pH is 5.5 (4.0 to 8.0).</p><p>Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) administered intravenously has value as a source of water, electrolytes, and calories. One liter has an ionic concentration of 140 mEq sodium, 5 mEq potassium, 3 mEq magnesium, 98 mEq chloride, 27 mEq acetate, and 23 mEq gluconate. The osmolarity is 294 mOsmol/L (calc). Normal physiologic osmolarity range is approximately 280 to 310 mOsmol/L. The caloric content is 21 kcal/L.</p><p>The VIAFLEX plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride (PL 146 Plastic). The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, e.g., di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. However, the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p><h2>Plasma-Lyte 148 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) has value as a source of water and electrolytes. It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.</p><p>Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) produces a metabolic alkalinizing effect. Acetate and gluconate ions are metabolized ultimately to carbon dioxide and water, which requires the consumption of hydrogen cations.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Plasma-Lyte 148</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) is indicated as a source of water and electrolytes or as an alkalinizing agent.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the product.

Avoid use in patients with hypochloremic hypokalemic alkalosis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypocalcemia</span></p><p>Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) contains no calcium, and an increase in plasma pH due to its alkalinizing effect may lower the concentration of ionized (not-protein bound) calcium. Avoid Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) in patients with hypocalcemia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Potassium-containing solutions, including Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) may increase the risk of hyperkalemia.</p><p>Patient’s at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia include those:</p><p>Avoid Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) in patients with, or at risk for hyperkalemia If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium concentrations.</p><p>Although Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) has a potassium concentration similar to the concentration in plasma, it is insufficient to produce a useful effect in case of severe potassium deficiency; therefore, it is not indicated for correction of severe potassium deficiency.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with renal impairment, administration of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) may result in sodium and/or potassium or magnesium retention (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Avoid Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) in patients with severe renal impairment or conditions that may cause sodium and/or potassium retention or magnesium retention, fluid overload, or edema. If use cannot be avoided, monitor patients with severe renal impairment for development of these adverse reactions.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Products that Affect Fluid and/or Electrolyte Balance</span></p><p>Administration of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) to patients treated concomitantly with drugs associated with sodium and fluid retention may increase the risk of hypernatremia and volume overload. Avoid use of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) in patients receiving such products, such as corticosteroids or corticotropin. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum electrolytes, fluid balance and acid-base balance.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Drugs that Increase the Risk of Hyponatremia</span></p><p>Administration of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) in patients treated concomitantly with medications associated with hyponatremia may increase the risk of developing hyponatremia.</p><p>Avoid use of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) in patients receiving products, such as diuretics, and certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications. Drugs that increase the vasopressin effect reduce renal electrolyte free water excretion and may also increase the risk of hyponatremia following treatment with intravenous fluids. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Lithium</span></p><p>Renal clearance of lithium may be increased during administration of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP). Monitor serum lithium concentrations during concomitant use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Products that Increase the Risk of Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Because of its potassium content, avoid use of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) in patients receiving products that can cause hyperkalemia or increase the risk of hyperkalemia, such as potassium sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or the immunosuppressants tacrolimus and cyclosporine. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drugs with pH Dependent Renal Elimination</span></p><p>Due to its alkalinizing effect (formation of bicarbonate), Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) may interfere with the elimination of drugs with pH dependent renal elimination. Renal clearance of acidic drugs may be increased. Renal clearance of alkaline drugs may be decreased.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of positive test results using the Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span> EIA test in patients receiving Baxter gluconate containing PLASMA-LYTE solutions. These patients were subsequently found to be free of <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span> infection. Therefore, positive test results for this test in patients receiving Baxter gluconate containing PLASMA-LYTE solutions should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed by other diagnostic methods.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Studies with Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or effects on fertility.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP). It is also not known whether Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known where this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) is administered to a nursing mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The use of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) in pediatric patients is based on clinical practice.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Geriatric patients are at increased risk of developing electrolyte imbalances. Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Post-marketing Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Plasma-Lyte 148 Injection (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1, USP) were identified in clinical trials or postmarketing reports.
