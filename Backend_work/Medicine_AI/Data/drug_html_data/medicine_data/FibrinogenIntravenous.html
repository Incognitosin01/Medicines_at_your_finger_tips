This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fibrinogen, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fibrinogen or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fibrinogen injection in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of fibrinogen injection have not been performed in the geriatric population. However, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of fibrinogen</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you fibrinogen.

Blood tests will be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Fibrinogen may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have a rash, itching skin, difficulty with swallowing, dizziness, a fast heartbeat, lightheadedness or fainting, restlessness, trouble breathing, swelling in your face, hands, tongue, or throat, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Fibrinogen may increase your chance of having blood clotting problems. Tell your doctor right away if you have a sudden or severe headache, problems with vision or speech, chest pain, shortness of breath, or numbness or weakness while you are receiving fibrinogen.</p><p>Fibrinogen is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low.

Talk with your doctor about this risk if you are concerned.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Fibrinogen side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
