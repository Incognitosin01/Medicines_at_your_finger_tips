<li><span class="Bold">The use of benzodiazepines, including Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, for several days to weeks may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets or reduce the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</span></span></li>
</ul><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><h3>1.1 Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h3><p class="First">Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.</p><p>The efficacy of alprazolam in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder was demonstrated in 5 short-term, placebo-controlled trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>1.2 Panic Disorder</h3><p class="First">Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, USP are also indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.</p><p>The efficacy of alprazolam in the treatment of panic disorder was established in 2 short-term, placebo-controlled trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>Demonstrations of the effectiveness of alprazolam by systematic clinical study are limited to 4 months in duration for generalized anxiety disorder and 4 to 10 weeks duration for panic disorder; however, patients with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some who require doses greater than 4 mg per day. In such cases, the dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse reactions. In general, benzodiazepines should be prescribed for short periods. Reevaluate the need for continued therapy before extending the treatment period.</span></p><h3>2.1 Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Initiate treatment with a dose of 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg three times daily. The dose may be increased to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect, at intervals of 3 to 4 days, to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses. Use the lowest possible effective dose, and periodically reassess the need for continued treatment. The risk of dependence can increase with dose and duration of treatment.</span></p><h3>2.2 Panic Disorder</h3><p class="First">The successful treatment of many panic disorder patients has required the use of alprazolam at doses greater than 4 mg daily. In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of alprazolam in panic disorder, doses in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg daily were used. The mean dosage employed was approximately 5 mg to 6 mg daily. Among the approximately 1700 patients participating in the panic disorder development program, about 300 received alprazolam in dosages of greater than 7 mg per day, including approximately 100 patients who received maximum dosages of greater than 9 mg per day. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg a day to achieve a successful response.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Dose Titration</span></span></p><p>Initiate treatment with a dose of 0.5 mg three times daily. Depending on the response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day. Slower titration to the dose levels greater than 4 mg per day may be advisable to allow full expression of the pharmacodynamic effect of alprazolam. To lessen the possibility of interdose symptoms, the times of administration should be distributed as evenly as possible throughout the waking hours, (i.e., administered three or four times daily).</p><p>Generally, therapy should be initiated at a low dose to minimize the risk of adverse responses in patients especially sensitive to the drug. The dose should be advanced until an acceptable therapeutic response (i.e., a substantial reduction in or total elimination of panic attacks) is achieved, intolerance occurs, or the maximum recommended dose is attained.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Dose Maintenance</span></span></p><p>For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodically reassess treatment and consider a reduction of dosage. In a controlled postmarketing dose-response study, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg per day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total daily maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit. Because of the danger of withdrawal, avoid abrupt discontinuation of treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)</span></span><span class="Italics">, Drug Abuse and Dependence (</span><span class="Italics">9.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>The necessary duration of treatment for panic disorder patients responding to alprazolam is unknown. After a period of extended freedom from attacks, a carefully supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may often be difficult to accomplish without recurrence of symptoms and/or the manifestation of withdrawal phenomena.</p><h3>2.3 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Alprazolam Orally Disintegrating Tablets</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, there was no difference between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered and completely discontinued treatment with alprazolam; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. Reduce the dose by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.</span><br/></p><h3>2.4 Dosing in Special Populations</h3><p class="First">In elderly patients, in patients with advanced liver disease, or in patients with debilitating disease (e.g., severe pulmonary disease), the usual starting dose is 0.25 mg, given two or three times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. The elderly may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dose, the dose may be lowered.</p><h3>2.5 Instructions to be Given to Patients for Use/Handling Alprazolam Orally Disintegrating Tablets</h3><p class="First">Just prior to administration, with dry hands, remove the tablet from the bottle. Immediately place the alprazolam orally disintegrating<span class="Bold"> </span>tablet on top of the tongue where it will disintegrate and be swallowed with saliva. Administration with liquid is not necessary.</p><p>Discard any cotton that was included in the bottle and reseal the bottle tightly to prevent introducing moisture that might cause the tablets to disintegrate.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg scored orally disintegrating tablets.</span></p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute narrow angle glaucoma. Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets can exacerbate narrow angle closure. Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets may be used in patients with open angle glaucoma who are receiving appropriate therapy.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients treated with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and itraconazole), because these medications significantly impair the oxidative metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and can increase alprazolam exposures <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">), Warnings and Precautions (<span class="Italics">5.8</span></span><span class="Italics">), and Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7.4</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</span></p><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe alprazolam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of alprazolam than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking alprazolam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when alprazolam is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The use of benzodiazepines, including Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Before prescribing Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest possible dosage for the shortest duration; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.</span><br/></p><h3>5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use.<br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Underline XmChange">Acute Withdrawal Reactions</span><br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The continued use of benzodiazepines, including Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets for several days to weeks may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets after continued use (for several days to weeks), or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Underline XmChange">Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome</span><br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to alprazolam. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>. Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of dependence and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg per day and for long periods (more than 12 weeks). However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. In contrast, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg per day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than those treated with less than 4 mg per day.<br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Italics">The importance of dose and the risks of Alprazolam as a treatment for panic disorder</span><br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Because the management of panic disorder often requires the use of average daily doses of alprazolam above 4 mg, the risk of dependence among panic disorder patients may be higher than that among those treated for less severe anxiety. Experience in randomized placebo-controlled discontinuation studies of patients with panic disorder showed a high rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms in patients treated with alprazolam compared to placebo-treated patients.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Relapse or return of illness was defined as a return of symptoms characteristic of panic disorder (primarily panic attacks) to levels approximately equal to those seen at baseline before active treatment was initiated. Rebound refers to a return of symptoms of panic disorder to a level substantially greater in frequency, or more severe in intensity than seen at baseline. Withdrawal symptoms were identified as those which were generally not characteristic of panic disorder and which occurred for the first time more frequently during discontinuation than at baseline.<br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss. Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal.<br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In two controlled trials of 6 to 8 weeks duration where the ability of patients to discontinue medication was measured, 71% to 93% of patients treated with alprazolam tapered completely off therapy compared to 89% to 96% of placebo-treated patients. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose.<br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Seizures attributable to alprazolam were seen after drug discontinuance or dose reduction in 8 of 1980 patients with panic disorder or in patients participating in clinical trials where doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day for over 3 months were permitted. Five of these cases clearly occurred during abrupt dose reduction, or discontinuation from daily doses of 2 mg to 10 mg. Three cases occurred in situations where there was not a clear relationship to abrupt dose reduction or discontinuation. In one instance, seizure occurred after discontinuation from a single dose of 1 mg after tapering at a rate of 1 mg every 3 days from 6 mg daily. In two other instances, the relationship to taper is indeterminate; in both of these cases the patients had been receiving doses of 3 mg daily prior to seizure. The duration of use in the above 8 cases ranged from 4 to 22 weeks. There have been occasional voluntary reports of patients developing seizures while apparently tapering gradually from alprazolam. The risk of seizure seems to be greatest 24 to 72 hours after discontinuation <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.<br/></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">To discontinue treatment in patients taking alprazolam, the dosage should be reduced gradually. Decrease the daily dosage of alprazolam by no more than 0.5 mg every three days <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>. Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.</span><br/></p><h3>5.4 Suicide and Overdose</h3><p class="First">As with other psychotropic medications, the usual precautions with respect to administration of the drug and size of the prescription are indicated for severely depressed patients or those in whom there is reason to expect concealed suicidal ideation or plans. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients.</p><h3>5.5 Status Epilepticus</h3><p class="First">Withdrawal seizures have been reported in association with the discontinuation of alprazolam. In most cases, only a single seizure was reported; however, multiple seizures and status epilepticus were reported as well.</p><h3>5.6 Risk of Fetal Harm</h3><p class="First">Benzodiazepines can potentially cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. If alprazolam is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Because of experience with other members of the benzodiazepine class, alprazolam is assumed to be capable of causing an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, their use during the first trimester should almost always be avoided. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability of discontinuing the drug.</p><h3>5.7 CNS Depression and Impaired Performance</h3><p class="First">Because alprazolam has CNS depressant effects and has the potential to impair judgment, cognition, and motor performance, caution patients against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, until they are reasonably certain that alprazolam treatment does not affect them adversely. Caution patients about the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with alprazolam.</p><h3>5.8 Mania</h3><p class="First">Episodes of hypomania and mania have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam in patients with depression.</p><h3>5.9 Alprazolam Interaction with Drugs that Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A</h3><p class="First">The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam. Consequently, alprazolam should be avoided in patients receiving potent inhibitors of CYP3A. With drugs inhibiting CYP3A to a lesser but still significant degree, alprazolam should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction. For some drugs, an interaction with alprazolam has been quantified with clinical data; for other drugs, interactions are predicted from <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data and/or experience with similar drugs in the same pharmacologic class.</p><p>The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of alprazolam and/or related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Potent CYP3A Inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Azole antifungal agents - Ketoconazole and itraconazole are potent CYP3A inhibitors and have been shown <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations 3.98 fold and 2.70 fold, respectively. The coadministration of alprazolam with these agents is not recommended. Other azole-type antifungal agents should also be considered potent CYP3A inhibitors and the coadministration of alprazolam with them is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">CONTRAINDICATIONS (</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Drugs demonstrated to be CYP3A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving alprazolam</span></span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"> </span></span></p><p>Consider dose reduction of alprazolam during coadministration with the following drugs:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Nefazodone - Coadministration of nefazodone increased alprazolam concentration two-fold.</li>
<li>Fluvoxamine - Coadministration of fluvoxamine approximately doubled the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam, decreased clearance by 49%, increased half-life by 71%, and decreased measured psychomotor performance.</li>
<li>Cimetidine - Coadministration of cimetidine increased the maximum plasma concentration of alprazolam by 86%, decreased clearance by 42%, and increased half-life by 16%.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Other drugs possibly affecting alprazolam metabolism</span></span></p><p>Other drugs possibly affect alprazolam metabolism by inhibition of CYP3A <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">7.6</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>5.10 Interdose Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Early morning anxiety and emergence of anxiety symptoms between doses of alprazolam have been reported in patients with panic disorder taking prescribed maintenance doses of alprazolam. These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose. In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval. In these situations, it is recommended that the same total daily dose be given divided as more frequent administrations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>5.11 Uricosuric Effect</h3><p class="First">Alprazolam has a weak uricosuric effect. Although other medications with weak uricosuric effect have been reported to cause acute renal failure, there have been no reported instances of acute renal failure attributable to therapy with alprazolam.</p><h3>5.12 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness</h3><p class="First">It is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective dose to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation which may be a particular problem in elderly or debilitated patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal, hepatic or pulmonary function should be observed. There have been rare reports of death in patients with severe pulmonary disease shortly after the initiation of treatment with alprazolam. A decreased systemic alprazolam elimination rate (e.g., increased plasma half-life) has been observed in both alcoholic liver disease patients and obese patients receiving alprazolam <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><h3>6.1 Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">The most commonly reported (greater than or equal to 5% and ~ twice the rate of placebo) adverse reactions with alprazolam treatment are: sedation, impaired coordination, dysarthria, and increased libido.</p><p>The data cited in the two tables below are estimates of adverse reactions occurring in patients who participated in clinical trials under the following conditions: relatively short duration (four weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 4 mg per day of alprazolam (for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety) and short-term (up to ten weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 10 mg per day of alprazolam in patients with panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.</p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Comparison of the cited figures, however, can provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse reaction incidence in the population studied. Even this use must be approached cautiously, as a drug may relieve a symptom in one patient but induce it in others. (For example, an anxiolytic drug may relieve dry mouth [a symptom of anxiety] in some subjects but induce dry mouth in others.)</p><p>In addition to the relatively common (i.e., greater than 1%) adverse reactions described in the table above, the following adverse reactions have been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines: dystonia, irritability, concentration difficulties, anorexia, transient amnesia or memory impairment, loss of coordination, fatigue, seizures, sedation, slurred speech, jaundice, musculoskeletal weakness, pruritus, diplopia, dysarthria, changes in libido, menstrual irregularities, incontinence and urinary retention.</p><p>In addition to the relatively common (i.e., greater than 1%) adverse reactions described in the table above, the following adverse reactions have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam: seizures, hallucinations, depersonalization, taste alterations, diplopia, elevated bilirubin, elevated hepatic enzymes, and jaundice.</p><p>Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions, (</span><span class="Italics">5.4</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>6.2 Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of alprazolam. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Reported events include: liver enzyme elevations, hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, gynecomastia, and galactorrhea.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>7.1 Use with Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>If alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets are coadministered with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, carefully consider the pharmacology of the agents to be employed, particularly with compounds which might potentiate the action of benzodiazepines. The benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, produce additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with other psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, alcohol and other drugs which themselves produce CNS depression.</p><h3>7.2 Drugs Effecting Salivary Flow and Stomach pH</h3><p class="First">Because alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets disintegrate in the presence of saliva, and the formulation requires an acidic environment to dissolve, concomitant drugs or diseases that cause dry mouth or raise stomach pH might slow disintegration or dissolution, resulting in slowed or decreased absorption.</p><h3>7.3 Use with Imipramine and Desipramine</h3><p class="First">The steady state plasma concentrations of imipramine and desipramine can increase by approximately 30% and 20%, respectively, when administered concomitantly with alprazolam in doses up to 4 mg per day. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.</p><h3>7.4 Drugs that Inhibit Alprazolam Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A</h3><p class="First">The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A).

The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. If alprazolam is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Because of experience with other members of the benzodiazepine class, alprazolam is assumed to be capable of causing an increased risk of congenital abnormalities when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency, their use during the first trimester should almost always be avoided <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<span class="Italics">5.6</span></span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nonteratogenic Effects:</span> It should be considered that the child born of a mother who is receiving benzodiazepines may be at some risk for withdrawal symptoms from the drug during the postnatal period. Also, neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems have been reported in children born of mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines.</p><h3>8.2 Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The potential effect of alprazolam in labor and delivery in humans has not been studied. However, perinatal complications have been reported in neonates exposed to benzodiazepines late in pregnancy. The findings are suggestive of excess benzodiazepine exposure or withdrawal phenomena.</p><h3>8.3 Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Benzodiazepines are excreted in human milk. It should be assumed that alprazolam is excreted in human milk. Chronic administration of diazepam to nursing mothers has been reported to cause their infants to become lethargic and to lose weight. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from alprazolam, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken by mothers who must use alprazolam.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of alprazolam in individuals below 18 years of age have not been studied.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The elderly may be more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. They exhibit higher plasma alprazolam concentrations due to reduced clearance of the drug, compared with a younger population receiving the same doses. The smallest effective dose of alprazolam should be used in the elderly to preclude the development of ataxia and oversedation <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12</span><span class="Italics">)</span> and <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>Changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of benzodiazepines have been demonstrated in geriatric patients.

Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Both abuse and misuse may lead to addiction, and some individuals may develop addiction even when taking Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets as prescribed.</p><p>Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.<br/></p><p>The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo.<br/></p><p>The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol)<span class="Italics">.</span><br/></p><h3>9.3 Dependence</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Physical Dependence</span></p><p>Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p>To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets or reduce the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span><br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Acute Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms</span><br/></p><p>Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, cognitive disorder, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, homicidal thoughts, mania, psychosis, and suicidality.</p><p><span class="Italics">Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome</span><br/></p><p>Protracted withdrawal syndrome is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Tolerance</span><br/></p><p>Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets may produce tolerance from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance may develop within days or weeks of the therapeutic effects of Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>10.1 Human Clinical Experience</h3><p class="First">Manifestations of alprazolam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, diminished reflexes and coma. Death has been reported in association with overdoses of alprazolam by itself, as it has with other benzodiazepines. In addition, fatalities have been reported in patients who have overdosed with a combination of a single benzodiazepine, including alprazolam, and alcohol; alcohol levels seen in some of these patients have been lower than those usually associated with alcohol-induced fatality.</p><h3>10.2 Management of Overdose</h3><p class="First">For the most up to date information on management of alprazolam overdose, contact a certified poison center in your area (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org). In case of an overdose, provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdose. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures.</p><p>Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway, ventilation and intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, respiratory depression, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. <span class="Bold">The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose.</span> The complete flumazenil package insert including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS should be consulted prior to use.</p><h2>Alprazolam ODT Description</h2><p class="First">Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, USP contain alprazolam, USP which is a triazolo analog of the 1,4 benzodiazepine class of central nervous system-active compounds.</p><p>Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, USP are an orally administered formulation of alprazolam which rapidly disintegrates on the tongue and does not require water to aid dissolution or swallowing.</p><p>The chemical name of alprazolam is 8-Chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-<span class="Italics">s</span>-triazolo [4,3-α] [1,4] benzodiazepine.

Benzodiazepines bind to gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the brain and enhance GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition; such actions may be responsible for the efficacy of alprazolam in anxiety disorder and panic disorder.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Following oral administration, alprazolam is readily absorbed. The peak plasma concentration is reached about 1.5 to 2 hours after administration of alprazolam given with or without water. When taken with water, mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> occurs about 15 minutes earlier than when taken without water with no change in C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC. Plasma levels are proportional to the dose given; over the dose range of 0.5 mg to 3 mg, peak levels of 8 to 37 ng/mL are observed. The elimination half-life of alprazolam is approximately 12.5 hours (range 7.9 to 19.2 hours) after administration of alprazolam in healthy adults.</p><p>Food decreased the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> by about 25% and increased the mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> by 2 hours from 2.2 hours to 4.4 hours after the ingestion of a high-fat meal. Food did not affect the extent of absorption (AUC) or the elimination half-life.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, alprazolam is bound (80 percent) to human serum protein. Serum albumin accounts for the majority of the binding.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Metabolism/Elimination</span></span></p><p>Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), to two major metabolites in the plasma: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam. The plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam relative to unchanged alprazolam concentration were always less than 4%. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced seizure inhibition are 0.20 and 0.66, respectively, for 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. Such low concentrations and the lesser potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam suggest that they are unlikely to contribute much to the pharmacological effects of alprazolam. The benzophenone metabolite is essentially inactive.</p><p>Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></span></p><p>Changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of benzodiazepines have been reported in a variety of disease states including alcoholism, impaired hepatic function and impaired renal function. Changes have also been demonstrated in geriatric patients. A mean half-life of alprazolam of 16.3 hours has been observed in healthy elderly subjects (range: 9.0 to 26.9 hours, n=16) compared to 11.0 hours (range: 6.3 to 15.8 hours, n=16) in healthy adult subjects. In patients with alcoholic liver disease, the half-life of alprazolam ranged between 5.8 and 65.3 hours (mean: 19.7 hours, n=17) as compared to between 6.3 and 26.9 hours (mean=11.4 hours, n=17) in healthy subjects. In an obese group of subjects, the half-life of alprazolam ranged between 9.9 and 40.4 hours (mean=21.8 hours, n=12) as compared to between 6.3 and 15.8 hours (mean=10.6 hours, n=12) in healthy subjects.</p><p>Because of its similarity to other benzodiazepines, it is assumed that alprazolam undergoes transplacental passage and that it is excreted in human milk.</p><p>Race - Maximal concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and half-life of alprazolam are approximately 15% and 25% higher in Asians compared to Caucasians.</p><p>Pediatrics - The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam in pediatric patients have not been studied.</p><p>Gender - Gender has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam.</p><p>Cigarette Smoking - Alprazolam concentrations may be reduced by up to 50% in smokers compared to non-smokers.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></span></p><p>Alprazolam is primarily eliminated by metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Most of the interactions that have been documented with alprazolam are with drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A.</p><p>Compounds that are potent inhibitors of CYP3A would be expected to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations. Drug products that have been studied <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>, along with their effect on increasing alprazolam AUC, are as follows: ketoconazole, 3.98 fold; itraconazole, 2.70 fold; nefazodone, 1.98 fold; fluvoxamine, 1.96 fold; and erythromycin, 1.61 fold <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span><span class="Italics">4</span><span class="Italics">), Warnings and Precautions (<span class="Italics">5.8</span></span><span class="Italics">),</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>CYP3A inducers would be expected to decrease alprazolam concentrations and this has been observed <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>. The oral clearance of alprazolam (given in a 0.8 mg single dose) was increased from 0.90 ± 0.21 mL/min/kg to 2.13 ± 0.54 mL/min/kg and the elimination t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> was shortened (from 17.1 ± 4.9 to 7.7 ± 1.7 h) following administration of 300 mg/day carbamazepine for 10 days <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. However, the carbamazepine dose used in this study was fairly low compared to the recommended doses (1000 mg to 1200 mg/day); the effect at usual carbamazepine doses is unknown.</p><p>The ability of alprazolam to induce or inhibit human hepatic enzyme systems has not been determined. However, this is not a property of benzodiazepines in general. Further, alprazolam did not affect the prothrombin or plasma warfarin levels in male volunteers administered sodium warfarin orally.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed during 2-year bioassay studies of alprazolam in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg per day (30 times the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg per day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and in mice at doses up to 10 mg/kg per day (5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><p>Alprazolam also was not mutagenic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the DNA Damage/Alkaline Elution Assay or the Ames Assay, and was negative in the rat micronucleus test.</p><p>Alprazolam produced no impairment of fertility in rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg per day, which is 5 times the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg per day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h3>13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">When rats were treated with oral alprazolam doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg per day (3 to 30 times the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg per day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) for 2 years, a tendency for a dose related increase in the number of cataracts was observed in females, and a tendency for a dose related increase in corneal vascularization was observed in males. These lesions did not appear until after 11 months of treatment.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>14.1 Anxiety Disorders</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of alprazolam in the treatment of anxiety symptoms was demonstrated in five short-term (4 weeks), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The studies included patients with a diagnosis of anxiety or anxiety with associated depressive symptomatology. Alprazolam doses ranged from 0.5 mg to 4 mg per day. The mean daily doses ranged from 1.6 mg to 2.4 mg. Treatment with alprazolam was statistically significantly superior to placebo treatment, as measured by the following psychometric instruments: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Physician’s Global Impressions, Target Symptoms, Patient’s Global Impressions and Self-Rating Symptom Scale.</p><h3>14.2 Panic Disorder</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of alprazolam in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in three short-term (up to 10 weeks), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients in the studies had diagnoses corresponding closely to DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia).</p><p>The average dose of alprazolam was 5 mg to 6 mg per day in two of the studies, and the doses of alprazolam were fixed at 2 mg and 6 mg per day in the third study. In all three studies, alprazolam was superior to placebo on a variable defined as "the number of patients with zero panic attacks" (range, 37 to 83% met this criterion), as well as on a global improvement score. In two of the three studies, alprazolam was superior to placebo on a variable defined as "change from baseline on the number of panic attacks per week" (range, 3.3 to 5.2), and also on a phobia rating scale. A subgroup of patients who were improved on alprazolam during short-term treatment in one of these trials was continued on an open basis up to 8 months, without apparent loss of benefit.</p><h2>16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alprazolam orally disintegrating tablets, USP are supplied as follows:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">0.25 mg - Each white to off-white, round tablet imprinted with  on one side and 019 and bisect on the other side contains 0.25 mg of Alprazolam, USP.
