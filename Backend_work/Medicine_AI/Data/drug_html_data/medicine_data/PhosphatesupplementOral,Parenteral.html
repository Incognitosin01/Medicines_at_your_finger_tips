</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for phosphate supplement</h2><p>Phosphates are used as dietary supplements for patients who are unable to get enough phosphorus in their regular diet, usually because of certain illnesses or diseases. Phosphate is the drug form (salt) of phosphorus. Some phosphates are used to make the urine more acid, which helps treat certain urinary tract infections. Some phosphates are used to prevent the formation of calcium stones in the urinary tract.</p><p>Injectable phosphates are to be administered only by or under the supervision of your health care professional. Some of these oral preparations are available only with a prescription. Others are available without a prescription; however, your health care professional may have special instructions on the proper dose of phosphate supplement for your medical condition. You should take phosphates only under the supervision of your health care professional.</p><h2>Importance of Diet</h2><p>For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.</p><p>The best dietary sources of phosphorus include dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, and cereal products.</p><p>The daily amount of phosphorus needed is defined in several different ways.</p><ul>For U.S.—
<li>Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).</li>
<li>Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).</li>
</ul><ul>For Canada—
<li>Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.</li>
</ul><p>Normal daily recommended intakes for phosphorus are generally defined as follows:</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using phosphate supplement</h2><p>If you are taking a dietary supplement without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label. For these supplements, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Problems in children have not been reported with intake of normal daily recommended amounts. However, use of enemas that contain phosphates in children has resulted in high blood levels of phosphorus.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Problems in older adults have not been reported with intake of normal daily recommended amounts.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>It is especially important that you are receiving enough vitamins and minerals when you become pregnant and that you continue to receive the right amount of vitamins and minerals throughout your pregnancy. The healthy growth and development of the fetus depend on a steady supply of nutrients from the mother. However, taking large amounts of a dietary supplement in pregnancy may be harmful to the mother and/or fetus and should be avoided.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>It is especially important that you receive the right amount of vitamins and minerals so that your baby will also get the vitamins and minerals needed to grow properly. However, taking large amounts of a dietary supplement while breast-feeding may be harmful to the mother and/or baby and should be avoided.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these dietary supplements, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using dietary supplements in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of phosphate supplement</h2><p>For patients taking the <i>tablet form</i> of phosphate supplement:</p><ul>
<li>Do not swallow the tablet. Before taking, dissolve the tablet in ¾ to 1 glass (6 to 8 ounces) of water. Let the tablet soak in water for 2 to 5 minutes and then stir until completely dissolved.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the <i>capsule form</i> of phosphate supplement:</p><ul>
<li>Do not swallow the capsule. Before taking, mix the contents of 1 capsule in one-third glass (about 2½ ounces) of water or juice or the contents of 2 capsules in two-thirds glass (about 5 ounces) of water and stir well until dissolved.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the <i>powder form</i> of phosphate supplement:</p><ul>
<li>Add the entire contents of 1 bottle (2¼ ounces) to enough warm water to make 1 gallon of solution or the contents of one packet to enough warm water to make 1/3 of a glass (about 2.5 ounces) of solution. Shake the container for 2 or 3 minutes or until all the powder is dissolved.</li>
<li>Do not dilute solution further.</li>
<li>This solution may be chilled to improve the flavor; do not allow it to freeze.</li>
<li>Discard unused solution after 60 days.</li>
</ul><p><i>Take phosphate supplement immediately after meals or with food</i> to lessen possible stomach upset or laxative action.</p><p>To help prevent kidney stones, <i>drink at least a full glass (8 ounces) of water every hour during waking hours</i>, unless otherwise directed by your health care professional.</p><p><i>Take phosphate supplement only as directed</i>. Do not take more of it and do not take it more often than recommended on the label, unless otherwise directed by your health care professional.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>For potassium phosphates
