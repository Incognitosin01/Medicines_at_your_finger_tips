Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease, is an X-linked inherited disorder of blood coagulation characterized by insufficient or abnormal synthesis of the clotting protein factor IX. Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor which is synthesized in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Activated factor IX (IXa) in combination with factor VII:C activates factor X to Xa, resulting ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and the formation of a fibrin clot. The infusion of exogenous factor IX to replace the deficiency present in hemophilia B temporarily restores hemostasis. Factor IX is conjugated to a 40-kDa polyethylene glycol molecule, which slows down its removal from the circulation.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p><i>Single dose</i>: V<sub>d</sub>: Children ≤6 years of age: 72.3 mL/kg; Children 7 to 12 years: 68.3 mL/kg; Adolescents 13 to 17 years: 58.6 mL/kg; Adults: 47 mL/kg.</p><p><i>After multiple once-weekly prophylactic doses (steady state)</i>: V<sub>dss</sub>: Adolescents 13 to 17 years: 60.5 mL/kg; Adults: 65.8 mL/kg</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p><i>Single dose:</i> Children ≤6 years of age: 69.6 hours; Children 7 to 12 years: 76.3 hours; Adolescents 13 to 17 years: 89.4 hours; Adults: 83 hours.</p><p><i>After multiple once-weekly prophylactic doses (steady state)</i>: Adolescents 13 to 17 years: 103.1 hours; Adults: 114.9 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Factor IX deficiency:</b> On-demand treatment and control of bleeding and perioperative management of bleeding in patients with factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B)</p><p>Limitations of use: Not indicated for the treatment of other factor deficiencies (eg, factor II, VII, VIII, X), for the treatment of hemophilia A patients with inhibitors to factor VIII, the reversal of coumarin-induced anticoagulation, or for the treatment of bleeding because of low levels of liver-dependent coagulation factors.

Diluent and factor IX should come to room temperature (if refrigerated) before combining.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: For IV infusion only. Solution should be infused at room temperature. Infuse slowly over 1 to 4 minutes based on patient response and comfort. With patients who have had allergic reactions during factor IX infusion, administration of hydrocortisone prior to infusion may be necessary (WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in the original packaging for ≤24 months from the date of manufacture until the expiration date stated on the label. Protect from light; do not freeze. May be stored at room temperature ≤30°C (86°F) for ≤6 months within the 24-month time period. Do not return to the refrigerator. Do not use after the end of the 6-month period at room temperature storage, or after the expiration date stated on the vial, whichever occurs earlier. Use within 4 hours after reconstitution when stored at room temperature; discard any unused product.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Pegloticase: May diminish the therapeutic effect of PEGylated Drug Products.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Pegvaliase: PEGylated Drug Products may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Pegvaliase. Specifically, the risk of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions may be increased. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Pruritus (3%)</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reaction (1%)</p><p>Local: Injection site reaction (4%)</p><p>Frequency not defined:</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Antibody formation: The development of factor IX antibodies (or inhibitors) has been reported with factor IX therapy (usually occurs within the first 10 to 20 exposure days); the risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions occurring may be greater in these patients. When clinical response is suboptimal, the patient has reached a specified number of exposure days, or patient is to undergo surgical procedure, screen for inhibitors. Patients with severe hemophilia compared to those with mild or moderate hemophilia are more likely to develop inhibitors (WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Observe patients for signs/symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the initial exposure. Due to potential for allergic reactions, the initial ~10 to 20 administrations should be performed under appropriate medical supervision. Hypersensitivity reactions may be associated with factor IX inhibitor development; patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for factor IX inhibitors. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue immediately; in the case of severe allergic reactions, consider the use of alternative hemostatic measures (WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><p>• Nephrotic syndrome: Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in hemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions. Safety and efficacy in this situation have not been established.</p><p>• Thrombotic events: Observe closely for signs or symptoms of intravascular coagulation or thrombosis; risk is generally associated with the use of factor IX complex concentrates (containing therapeutic amounts of additional factors); however, potential risk exists with use of factor IX products (containing only factor IX). Use with caution when administering to patients with liver disease, postoperatively, neonates, or patients at risk of thromboembolic phenomena, disseminated intravascular coagulation or patients with signs of fibrinolysis due to the potential risk of thromboembolic complications.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with extreme caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of thromboembolic complications.</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Hamster protein: May contain trace amounts of Chinese hamster proteins; hypersensitivity to these proteins may develop.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Clinical response: Response to factor IX administration may vary. If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, determine plasma level of factor IX and follow with a sufficient dose to achieve satisfactory clinical response. If plasma levels of factor IX fail to increase as expected or bleeding continues, suspect the presence of an inhibitor; test as appropriate.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Heart rate and blood pressure (before and during IV administration); signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction; signs of bleeding, hemoglobin, hematocrit; factor IX levels (by chromogenic assay or selected one-stage clotting assay if available); development of factor IX inhibitors</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Pregnant hemophilia B carriers may have an increased bleeding risk following abortion, invasive procedures, miscarriage, and delivery; close surveillance is recommended. Factor IX levels should be monitored at the first antenatal visit, once or twice during the third trimester, prior to surgical or invasive procedures, and at delivery. Although factor IX levels remain stable during pregnancy, factor IX replacement is recommended if concentrations are &lt;0.5 IU/mL and any of the following occur: need for invasive procedures (including delivery), spontaneous miscarriage, insertion and removal of epidural catheters, or active bleeding. Hemostatic factor IX concentrations should be maintained for at least 3 to 5 days following invasive procedures or postpartum. If replacement with a factor IX concentrate is indicated to increase factor IX during pregnancy, a recombinant product is preferred (NHF 2017; RCOG [Pavord 2017]; WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat hemophilia.</p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent bleeding.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
