The structural formula is:</p><p></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level.</p><p>The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.</p><p>Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Estrogen drug products are absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and the gastrointestinal tract after release from the drug formulation.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the gut followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Special Populations</span></p><p>No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in special populations, including patients with renal or hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John’s Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may<span class="Bold"> </span>result in side effects.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Women’s Health Initiative Studies</span></p><p>The WHI enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE (0.625 mg)-alone or in combination with MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases.

The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to 12-times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than one year.

In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.

Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.</p><p>The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin therapy has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.</p><p>All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations.

The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years]vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use  (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27-1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.</p><h3>3. Probable Dementia</h3><p class="First">In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.</p><p>After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years<span class="Sup">10</span> [see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use</span>].      </p><p>In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.</p><p>After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years <span class="Sup">10</span> [see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span><span class="Bold"> </span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use</span>].</p><p>When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women <span class="Sup">10</span> [see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use].</p><h3>4. Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.</p><h3>5. Hypercalcemia</h3><p class="First">Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.</p><h3>6. Visual Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.</p><h3>7. Anaphylactic Reaction and Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Cases of anaphylaxis, which develop within minutes to hours after taking orally-administered estrogen and require emergency medical management, have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Skin (hives, pruritis, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) involvement has been noted.</p><p>Angioedema involving the tongue, larynx, face, hands and feet requiring medical intervention has occurred postmarketing in patients taking orally-administered estrogen. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur. Patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction with or without angioedema after treatment with oral estrogen should not receive oral estrogen again.</p><h3>8. Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema<span class="Bold">.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>A.

Patient Information</h3><p class="First">Physicians are advised to discuss the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet with women for whom they prescribe ESTRACE (estradiol vaginal cream, USP, 0.01%).</p><h3>C. Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Serum FSH and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.</p><h3>D. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><h3>E. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term continuous administration of estrogen, with and without progestin, in women with and without a uterus, has shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. (See <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNINGS</span><span class="Bold">,</span> <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span><span class="Bold"> </span>and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.)</p><p>Long term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.</p><h3>F. Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">ESTRACE should not be used during pregnancy [see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="Bold">]</span>.</p><p>There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins as an oral contraceptive inadvertently during early pregnancy.</p><h3>G. Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">ESTRACE should not be used during lactation. Estrogen administration to nursing women has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the breast milk. Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of women receiving estrogen therapy. Caution should be exercised when ESTRACE is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>H. Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"> ESTRACE Vaginal Cream is not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population.</p><h3>I. Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients involved in studies utilizing ESTRACE  to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to ESTRACE.</p><p><span class="Italics">The Women’s Health Initiative Study</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg]-alone versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age [see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span><span class="Bold"> </span>and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span><span class="Bold">].</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age [see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">The Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study</span></p><p>In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo [see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span> and WARNINGS].</p><p>Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women <span class="Sup">10</span> [see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNINGS</span><span class="Bold">,</span> <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>.</p><p>Systemic absorption may occur with the use of ESTRACE. The warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions associated with oral estrogen treatment should be taken into account.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been reported with estrogen and/or progestin therapy.</p><h3>1. Genitourinary System</h3><p class="First">Abnormal uterine bleeding or spotting; dysmenorrhea or pelvic pain, increase in size of uterine leiomyomata; vaginitis, including vaginal candidiasis; change in cervical secretion; cystitis-like syndrome; application site reactions of vulvovaginal discomfort including burning and irritation; genital pruritus; ovarian cancer; endometrial hyperplasia; endometrial cancer.</p><h3>2. Breasts</h3><p class="First">Tenderness, enlargement, pain, nipple discharge, fibrocystic breast changes; breast cancer.</p><h3>3. Cardiovascular</h3><p class="First">Deep and superficial venous thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; myocardial infarction; stroke; increase in blood pressure.</p><h3>4.

Miscellaneous</h3><p class="First">Increase or decrease in weight; glucose intolerance; edema; arthralgias; leg cramps; changes in libido; urticaria; exacerbation of asthma; increased triglycerides; hypersensitivity.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, abdominal pain, drowsiness and fatigue, and withdrawal bleeding may occur in women. Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of ESTRACE therapy together with institution of appropriate symptomatic care.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">Use of ESTRACE alone or in combination with a progestin, should be limited to the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should reevaluate periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary. For treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the lowest dose and regimen that will control symptoms should be chosen and medication should be discontinued as promptly as possible. For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, including directed and random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.</p><p>Usual Dosage: The usual dosage range is 2 to 4 g (marked on the applicator) daily for one or two weeks, then gradually reduced to one half initial dosage for a similar period. A maintenance dosage of 1 g, one to three times a week, may be used after restoration of the vaginal mucosa has been achieved.</p><p><span class="Bold">NOTE: The number of doses per tube will vary with dosage requirements and patient handling.</span></p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ESTRACE (estradiol vaginal cream, USP, 0.01%).</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N</span> 0430-3754-14: Tube containing 1 ½ oz (42.5 g) with a calibrated plastic applicator for delivery of 1, 2, 3, or 4 g.</p><p><span class="Bold">S</span><span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">o</span><span class="Bold">r</span><span class="Bold">e</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">at</span> <span class="Bold">r</span><span class="Bold">o</span><span class="Bold">o</span><span class="Bold">m</span> <span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">e</span><span class="Bold">m</span><span class="Bold">p</span><span class="Bold">er</span><span class="Bold">a</span><span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">u</span><span class="Bold">r</span><span class="Bold">e</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">20°</span> <span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">o 25°C</span> <span class="Bold">(</span><span class="Bold">59°</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">o</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">77°</span><span class="Bold">F</span><span class="Bold">)</span><span class="Bold">.</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">P</span><span class="Bold">r</span><span class="Bold">o</span><span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">ec</span><span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">f</span><span class="Bold">r</span><span class="Bold">o</span><span class="Bold">m</span> <span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">e</span><span class="Bold">m</span><span class="Bold">p</span><span class="Bold">er</span><span class="Bold">a</span><span class="Bold">t</span><span class="Bold">u</span><span class="Bold">re</span><span class="Bold">s in</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">e</span><span class="Bold">x</span><span class="Bold">c</span><span class="Bold">e</span><span class="Bold">ss of</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">40°C</span> <span class="Bold">(</span><span class="Bold">104°</span> <span class="Bold">F</span><span class="Bold">)</span><span class="Bold">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Keep ESTRACE Vaginal Cream out of the reach of children.</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
