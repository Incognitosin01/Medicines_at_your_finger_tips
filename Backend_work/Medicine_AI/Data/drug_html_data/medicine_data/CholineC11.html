</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Choline C 11</h2><p class="First">Choline C11 Injection is indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence and non-informative bone scintigraphy, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In these patients, <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET imaging may help identify potential sites of prostate cancer recurrence for subsequent histologic confirmation. Suspected prostate recurrence is based upon elevated blood prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels following initial therapy. In clinical studies, images were produced with PET/CT coregistration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitation of Use</span>: <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET imaging is not a replacement for histologic verification of recurrent prostate cancer.</p><h2>Choline C 11 Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Radiation Safety - Drug Handling</h3><p class="First">Choline C 11 Injection is a radioactive drug and should be handled with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure during administration. Use waterproof gloves and effective shielding when handling Choline C 11 Injection. Radiopharmaceuticals, including Choline C 11 Injection, should only be used by or under the control of physicians who are qualified by specific training and experience in the safe use and handling of radioactive materials, and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate governmental agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides.</p><h3>Recommended Dose and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose is 370 to 740 MBq (10 to 20 mCi) administered as a bolus intravenous injection. The radioactivity dose (370 to 740 MBq, 10 to 20 mCi) is chosen based on patient body dimensions and the characteristics of the image acquisition system.</p><h3>Patient Preparation</h3><p class="First">Prior to administration of Choline C 11 Injection:</p><h3>Radiation Dosimetry</h3><p class="First">The estimated radiation absorbed doses for adults from intravenous injection of Choline C 11 Injection are shown in Table 1. These estimates are calculated from data in Tolvanen<span class="Sup">1</span> and using OLINDA/EXM (Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment/Exponential Modeling) software from Vanderbilt University.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">Adrenals</p><p class="First">3.59</p><p class="First">Bone - Osteogenic Cells</p><p class="First">4.81</p><p class="First">Bone - Red Marrow</p><p class="First">1.90</p><p class="First">Brain</p><p class="First">1.16</p><p class="First">Breast</p><p class="First">1.39</p><p class="First">Gallbladder Wall</p><p class="First">4.54</p><p class="First">GI<span class="Sup">a</span>- Lower Large Intestine Wall</p><p class="First">1.81</p><p class="First">GI<span class="Sup">a</span>- Small Intestine</p><p class="First">2.35</p><p class="First">GI<span class="Sup">a</span>- Stomach Wall</p><p class="First">6.00</p><p class="First">GI<span class="Sup">a</span>- Upper Large Intestine Wall</p><p class="First">6.41</p><p class="First">Heart wall</p><p class="First">3.43</p><p class="First">Kidneys</p><p class="First">20.62</p><p class="First">Liver</p><p class="First">20.11</p><p class="First">Lungs</p><p class="First">4.59</p><p class="First">Muscle</p><p class="First">2.54</p><p class="First">Ovaries</p><p class="First">2.02</p><p class="First">Pancreas</p><p class="First">29.19</p><p class="First">Skin</p><p class="First">1.22</p><p class="First">Spleen</p><p class="First">9.16</p><p class="First">Testes</p><p class="First">1.36</p><p class="First">Thymus</p><p class="First">1.69</p><p class="First">Thyroid</p><p class="First">1.49</p><p class="First">Urinary Bladder Wall</p><p class="First">3.41</p><p class="First">Uterus</p><p class="First">1.96</p><p class="First">Total body</p><p class="First">2.97</p><p class="First">Effective Dose (Ã¬Sv/MBq)<span class="Sup">c</span></p><p class="First">4.35</p><p>The effective dose resulting from a 740 MBq (20 mCi) dosage of Choline C 11 Injection is 3.22 mSv in an adult, (740 x 4.35 = 3219 mSv = 3.2 mSv). The use of a CT scan to calculate attenuation correction for reconstruction of 11C-choline images (as done in PET/ CT imaging) will add radiation exposure. Based upon current scanning techniques, an effective dose of 5.8 mSv would be added from CT scanning. The actual radiation dose is operator, scanner, and patient dependent. The total radiation exposure from 11C-choline administration and subsequent scan on a PET/CT scanner is estimated to be 9.0 mSv (3.2 mSv + 5.8 mSv).</p><h3>Imaging Guidelines</h3><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Choline C11 Injection contains 148 MBq to 1225 MBq (4 mCi to 33.1 mCi) per milliliter of <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline at End of Synthesis (EOS) calibration time in aqueous 0.9% sodium chloride solution (approximately 10 mL volume).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Imaging Errors</h3><p class="First">Imaging errors have been reported with <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET and PET/CT imaging. A negative image does not rule out the presence of recurrent prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of recurrent cancer. <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer (such as lung carcinoma and brain tumors). Clinical correlation, including histopathological evaluation of the suspected recurrence site, is essential to proper use of the PET imaging information.</p><h3>Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">As with any injectable drug product, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis may occur. Emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel should be immediately available.</p><h3>Radiation Risks</h3><p class="First">Choline C 11 Injection contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. Safe handling should be ensured to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and health care workers <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Exclusive of an uncommon, mild injection site reaction, no adverse reactions to <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline have been reported.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Colchicine and androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs have been reported to interfere with choline-based PET imaging <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>The impact of androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs upon <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET imaging may depend upon the hormonal responsiveness of a patient's recurrent prostate cancer. Clinical studies have not established this relationship but published reports suggest <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET imaging may be productive in patients with "hormone resistant" recurrent prostate cancer even if the patients are receiving anti- androgen therapy. Imaging may prove unproductive or misleading due to failed or insufficient <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline uptake in patients with hormone-responsive cancer if the patients are receiving androgen-deprivation therapy.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no adequate and well controlled studies with Choline C11 Injection in pregnant women and the fetal radiation dose from a <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET imaging study is unknown. It is not known whether Choline C11 Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline.</p><p>All radiopharmaceuticals, including Choline C11 Injection, have a potential to cause fetal harm. The likelihood of fetal harm depends on the stage of fetal development and the magnitude of the radiopharmaceutical dose. Assess pregnancy status before administering Choline C11 Injection to a female of child bearing potential. Choline C11 Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Choline C11 Injection is not indicated for use in women. It is not known whether Choline C11 Injection is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for radiation exposure to nursing infants from Choline C11 Injection, nursing mothers should use alternative infant nutrition sources (e.g., stored breast milk or infant formula) and pump and discard breast milk for 8 hours (&gt;10 half lives of radioactive decay for <span class="Sup">11</span>C isotope) after administration of the drug or avoid use of the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Choline C11 Injection have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h2>Choline C 11 Description</h2><h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3><p class="First">Choline C11 Injection is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical that is used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with PET imaging. The active ingredient, <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline, has the molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">4</span>CH<span class="Sub">14</span>NOCl with a molecular weight of 138.63 g and has the following chemical structure:</p><p>Choline C11 Injection is provided as a ready to use sterile, pyrogen-free, clear and colorless solution. Each milliliter contains 148 MBq to 1225 MBq (4 mCi to 33.1 mCi) of <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline at EOS calibration time in aqueous 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The pH of the solution is between 4.5 and 7.5.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><p class="First">Carbon 11 is a cyclotron-produced radionuclide that decays to Boron 11 by positron emission and has a physical half life of 20.4 minutes (Table 2).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Radiation / Emission</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">% Per Disintegration</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Energy</span></p><p class="First">Positron (Â®+)</p><p class="First">99.76</p><p class="First">960.2 keV (Max.)</p><p class="First">Gamma (Â±)*</p><p class="First">199.5</p><p class="First">511 keV</p><p>The specific gamma ray constant (point source air kerma coefficient) for 11C-choline is 5.8 R/mCi-hr at 1 cm.

Choline is involved in synthesis of the structural components of cell membranes, as well as modulation of trans- membrane signaling. Increased phospholipid synthesis (i.e., increased uptake of choline) has been associated with cell proliferation and the transformation process that occurs in tumor cells.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a study of men with prostatic hyperplasia or primary prostate cancer, PET imaging showed <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline radioactivity accumulated rapidly within the prostate; uptake appeared to peak by five minutes following injection of the drug and activity was retained over the subsequent 30 minute scanning period. Little uptake was observed in the bladder and rectum.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span>: <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline distributes mainly to the pancreas, kidneys, liver, spleen and colon <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>. Based upon the relatively low urinary excretion of radioactivity, renal distribution is predominantly to the organ itself, rather than via formation of urine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span>: Following intravenous administration, <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline undergoes metabolism resulting in the detection of <span class="Sup">11</span>Câbetaine as the major metabolite in blood. In a study of patients with prostate cancer or brain disorders, the fractional activities of <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline and <span class="Sup">11</span>C-betaine in human arterial plasma appeared to reach a plateau within 25 minutes, with <span class="Sup">11</span>Câbetaine representing 82% Â± 9% of the total <span class="Sup">11</span>C detected at that time point. A small amount of unmetabolized <span class="Sup">11</span>Câcholine was detected within the blood at the final sampling time point (40 minutes).</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span>: Urinary excretion of <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline was &lt; 2% of the injected radioactivity at 1.5 hours after injection of the drug. The rate of <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline excretion in urine was 0.014 mL/min.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long term studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Choline C 11 Injection. The mutagenic potential of Choline C 11 Injection has not been adequately evaluated; however, any radiopharmaceutical, including Choline C 11 Injection, has the potential to be mutagenic. The effect of Choline C 11 Injection on fertility has not been evaluated.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">A systematic review of published reports identified four studies that contained data sufficient to compare <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET imaging to histopathology (truth standard) among patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence and non-informative conventional imaging (for most patients, CT or MRI). In general, the suspected recurrence criteria consisted of at least two sequential PSA levels of &gt; 0.2 ng/mL for men who had undergone prostatectomy and PSA levels of â¥ 2 ng/mL above the post-therapy nadir for men who had undergone radiotherapy. The studies were predominantly single clinical site experiences and image acquisition generally surveyed radioactivity distribution from the base of the pelvis to the base of the skull.</p><p>Prospective studies: Two studies examined the ability of <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT to detect prostate cancer in pelvic and/or retroperitoneal lymph nodes among patients who had previously undergone radical prostatectomy. Both studies used a truth standard of lymph node histopathology. <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline images were interpreted by readers masked to clinical information; surgical resection of lymph nodes was performed by surgeons aware of the <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT results.</p><p>In Study One<span class="Sup">3</span>, 25 patients who underwent <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT and conventional imaging (CT or MRI) were scheduled to undergo pelvic or pelvic plus retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy following the imaging identification of suspected lymph node metastases. The median PSA was 2.0 ng/mL (range 0.2 to 23.1 ng/mL). The study excluded subjects with metastatic disease detected by bone scintigraphy or isolated prostatic fossa recurrence. Among the 25 patients, 21 had positive <span class="Sup">11</span>Câcholine PET/CT scans; histopathology verified cancer in 19 of these patients. Lymph node histopathology detected no cancer among the four patients who had surgery based only on positive conventional imaging; <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT was negative in all four patients. The study report included information for patients who had non-informative conventional imaging (CT or MRI, bone scintigraphy and transrectal ultrasound), as shown in Table 5.</p><p>In Study Two<span class="Sup">4</span>, 15 patients were scheduled to undergo pelvic or pelvis plus retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy solely based upon positive <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT imaging in the setting of negative conventional imaging (ultrasound and/or CT and/or MRI and/or bone scintigraphy). The median PSA was 2.0 ng/mL (range 1.0 to 8.0 ng/mL); all patients had previously undergone radical prostatectomy. Eight of the 15 patients had cancer verified by lymph node histology; histology detected no cancer in seven patients.</p><p>Retrospective Studies: Two studies were retrospective reviews of patients who underwent <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT and had histopathology obtained from biopsy of the prostatic fossa or other suspected recurrence sites.</p><p>In Study Three<span class="Sup">5</span>, <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT imaging was performed among 36 patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence and 13 subjects without suspected recurrence (controls). Prostatic fossa biopsies were performed among the patients with suspected recurrence. All the patients and control subjects had previously undergone radical prostatectomy; patient with suspected recurrence had no evidence of cancer using conventional clinical evaluations, including trans-rectal ultrasound and bone scintigraphy. PET/CT scans were interpreted by readers masked to clinical information. Median PSA was 2.0 ng/mL (range 0.3 - 12.1 ng/mL) for patients with suspected recurrence and 0.1 ng/mL (range 0.0 - 0.2 ng/mL) in control subjects. Prostatic fossa biopsy showed cancer in 33 of the 36 patients with suspected recurrence. PET/CT scans were positive in 25 of the 36 patients; two patients had false positive scans (one scan in a control subject and one scan in a suspected recurrence subject who had no cancer detected on prostatic fossa biopsy). Among the 13 control subjects, 12 had negative PET/CT scans.</p><p>In Study Four<span class="Sup">6,7</span>, 34 patients with negative conventional imaging underwent <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT and subsequently had biopsies of suspected recurrence sites. The median PSA level of the 34 patients was 3.9 ng/mL (range 0.2 to 65.0 ng/mL); 22 of the patients had previously undergone radical prostatectomy and 12 had received other therapy (radiotherapy, anti-androgen therapy or cryotherapy). <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT images were positive in 30 patients and negative in four patients. Cancer was verified by histopathology in 29 patients; 25 had positive PET/CT images and four had negative PET/CT images. Five patients with positive PET/CT images did not have cancer confirmed with histopathology.</p><p>As shown in Table 5, within each study at least half the patients with non-informative conventional imaging had positive <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT images and histologically verified recurrent prostate cancer.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients, n</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Total</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">True Positive</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">False Positive</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">True Negative</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">False Negative</span></p><p class="First">One</p><p class="First">13</p><p class="First">11</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">ND*</p><p class="First">ND*</p><p class="First">Two</p><p class="First">15</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">ND*</p><p class="First">ND*</p><p class="First">Three</p><p class="First">36</p><p class="First">23</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">Four</p><p class="First">34</p><p class="First">25</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">4</p><p>In Studies Three and Four, PSA levels were generally lower for patients with negative <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET/CT results than for patients with positive results. In Study Three, the median PSA was 2.6 ng/mL (range 0.6 - 12.1 ng/mL) among the 23 patients with true positive images; nine out of 11 patients with false negative or false positive images had PSA levels &lt; 2 ng/mL. In Study Four, the median PSA was 4.2 ng/mL (range 0.2 - 65.0 ng/mL) among the 25 patients with true positive images; PSA levels &lt; 2 ng/mL were observed in four of the nine patients with false negative or false positive images. These data, combined with other published reports, suggest that <span class="Sup">11</span>C-choline PET imaging performance may be more reliable among patients with blood PSA levels &gt; 2 ng/mL, compared to patients with lower levels.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How is Choline C 11 Supplied</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Choline C 11 Injection is packaged in a multi-dose glass vial containing between 148 MBq to 1225 MBq (4 mCi to 33.1 mCi) of <span class="Sup">11</span>C- choline at EOS calibration time in aqueous 0.9% sodium chloride solution (approximately 10 mL volume).</p><p>NDC 73410-004-01</p><h3>Storage and Handling</h3><p class="First">Store Choline C 11 Injection at 25Â°C (77Â°F); excursions permitted to 15 to 30Â°C (59 to 86Â°F) (see USP Controlled Room Temperature).
