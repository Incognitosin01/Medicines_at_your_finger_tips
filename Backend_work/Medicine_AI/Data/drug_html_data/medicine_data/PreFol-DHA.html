Do not take this product if you are presently taking mineral oil, unless directed by a doctor.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Daily ingestion of more than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids (ALA, EPA, and DHA) from fish oils may have potential antithrombotic activities, or effects, and may increase bleeding times. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids - including DHA, should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diatheses, including those taking anticoagulants.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause</span> <span class="Bold">of fatal poisoning in children under 6. KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF REACH OF</span> <span class="Bold">CHILDREN. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control</span> <span class="Bold">center immediately.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOYBEAN OIL AND FISH OIL.</span></p><h2>CAUTION:</h2><p class="First">Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS: General:</h2><p class="First">Folates (including folic acid and reduced folates), when administered as a single agent in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure the detection of B12 deficiency (specifically, the administration of folic acid may reverse the hematological manifestations of B12 deficiency, including pernicious anemia, while not addressing the neurological manifestations). Reduced folates may be less likely than folic acid to mask vitamin B12 deficiency. Folate therapy alone is inadequate for the treatment of B12 deficiency.</p><h2>PATIENT INFORMATION:</h2><p class="First">PreFol-DHA™ is a prescription vitamin for use only under the direction and supervision of a licensed physician.</p><h2>INTERACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Pyridoxine hydrochloride should not be given to patients receiving the drug levodopa, because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine hydrochloride. However, pyridoxine hydrochloride may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa. Drugs which may interact with folate include:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Antiepileptic drugs (AED): The AED class including, but not limited to, phenytoin, carbamazepine, primidone, valproic acid, phenobarbital and lamotrigine have been shown to impair folate absorption and increase the metabolism of circulating folate. Additionally, concurrent use of folic acid has been associated with enhanced phenytoin metabolism, lowering the levels of this AED in the blood and allowing breakthrough seizures to occur.</li>
<li>Capecitabine: Folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) may increase the toxicity of Capecitabine.</li>
<li>Cholestyramine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Colestipol: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Cycloserine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitors (DHFRI): DHFRIs block the conversion of folic acid to its active forms, and lower plasma and red blood cell folate levels. DHFRIs include aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, triamterene, and trimethoprim.</li>
<li>Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine exerts a noncompetitive inhibition of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate active transport in the intestine.</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Isotretinoin: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking isotretinoin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit some folate dependent enzymes in laboratory experiments. NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and sulindac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Oral Contraceptives: Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Methylprednisolone: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted after treatment with methylprednisolone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Pancreatic Enzymes: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking pancreatic extracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Pentamidine: Reduced folate levels have been seen with prolonged intravenous pentamidine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Smoking and alcohol: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Sulfasalazine: Inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes decreases serum folate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Warfarin can produce significant impairment in folate status after a 6 - month therapy.</p>
</li>

Paresthesia, somnolence, nausea and headaches have been reported with pyridoxine hydrochloride.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">Before, during, and or after pregnancy, one tablet daily or as prescribed by a physician.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">PreFol-DHA™ is dispensed in bottles of 30 softgel capsules.<br/>
