The active agent, cloxacillin benzathine, is a sparingly soluble salt of the semisynthetic penicillin, cloxacillin. Cloxacillin is a derivative of 6-aminopenicillanic acid, and therefore is chemically related to other penicillins. It has, however, the antibacterial properties described below, which distinguish it from certain other penicillins.</p><p>Each 10 mL disposable syringe contains cloxacillin benzathine equivalent to 500 mg of cloxacillin activity in a stable peanut oil gel. This product was manufactured by a non-sterilizing process.</p><h2>Storage:</h2><p class="First">Do not store above 25°C (77°F). Do not freeze.</p><h2>Action:</h2><p class="First">In the non-lactating mammary gland, Dry-Clox (cloxacillin benzathine) provides bactericidal levels of the active antibiotic, cloxacillin, for a prolonged period of time. This prolonged activity is due to the low solubility of the cloxacillin benzathine and to the slow-release oil-gel base. This prolonged contact between the antibiotic and the pathogenic organism enhances the probability of a bacteriological cure.</p><p>Cloxacillin is not destroyed by the enzyme, penicillinase, and therefore, is active against penicillin-resistant strains of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span>. It is also active against non-penicillinase-producing <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> as well as <span class="Italics">Streptococcus agalactiae</span>.</p><p>The class disc, Methicillin 5 mcg, should be used to estimate the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility of bacteria to cloxacillin.</p><h2>Indications:</h2><p class="First">For the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows during the dry period.</p><p>Dry-Clox has been shown by extensive clinical studies to be efficacious in the treatment of mastitis in dry cows, when caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus agalactiae</span> and <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> including penicillin-resistant strains.</p><p>Treatment of the dry cow with Dry-Clox is indicated in any cow known to harbor any of these organisms in the udder at drying off, or which has had repeated attacks of mastitis during the previous lactation, or is affected with mastitis at drying off, if caused by susceptible organisms.</p><h2>Dosage for Dry Cows:</h2><p class="First">Infuse the contents of one syringe (10 mL) into each infected quarter following the last milking or early in the dry period. See Directions for Use.</p><h2>Directions for Use:</h2><p class="First">Dry-Clox (cloxacillin benzathine) is for use in dry cows only. Administer immediately after the last milking, or early in the dry period. <span class="Bold">Use no later than 30 days prior to calving.</span></p><p>Completely milk out all four quarters. The udder and teats should be thoroughly washed with warm water containing a suitable dairy antiseptic and dried, preferably using individual paper towels. Carefully scrub the teat end and orifice with 70% alcohol, using a separate swab for each teat. <span class="Bold">Allow to dry.</span></p><p>Dry-Clox is packaged with the Opti-Sert<span class="Sup">®</span> Protective Cap.</p><p><span class="Bold">For partial insertion:</span> Twist off upper portion of the Opti-Sert Protective Cap to expose 3–4 mm of the syringe tip.</p><p><span class="Bold">For full insertion:</span> Remove protective cap to expose the full length of the syringe tip.</p><p>Insert syringe tip into the teat canal and expel the entire contents of syringe into the quarter. Withdraw the syringe and gently massage the quarter to distribute the medication.</p><p>Do not infuse contents of the mastitis syringe into the teat canal if the Opti-Sert Protective Cap is broken or damaged.</p><h2>Precautions:</h2><p class="First">Because it is a derivative of 6-aminopenicillanic acid, Dry-Clox has the potential for producing allergic reactions. Such reactions are rare; however, should they occur, the subject should be treated with antihistamines or pressor amines, such as epinephrine.</p><h2>Residue Warnings:</h2><p class="First">1. <span class="Bold">For use in dry cows only.</span></p><p>2. Not to be used within 30 days of calving.</p><p>3. Any animal infused with this product must not be slaughtered</p><p>for food until 30 days after the latest infusion.</p><h2>How Supplied</h2><p class="First">Dry-Clox (cloxacillin benzathine) Intramammary Infusion is supplied as 10 mL syringes containing 500 mg of cloxacillin activity per syringe.
