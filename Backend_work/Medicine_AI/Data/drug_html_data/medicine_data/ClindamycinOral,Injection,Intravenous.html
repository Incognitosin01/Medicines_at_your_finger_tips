Colectomy has been required with some antibiotic-resistant CDAD infections, and clindamycin therapy has been associated with fatal colitis. CDAD onset may occur more than 2 months after cessation of antibiotics. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial treatment. Clindamycin should be reserved for serious infections where less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate. Do not use clindamycin to treat nonbacterial infections (eg, most upper respiratory tract infections). Consider discontinuation of ongoing antibiotic treatment not directed against C difficile if CDAD is suspected or confirmed. Supportive treatment may include fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation when clinically indicated .</p><p>Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening.
