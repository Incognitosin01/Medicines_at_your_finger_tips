Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).</p><p>Extended-release carbidopa and levodopa (Rytary®) is also used to treat parkinsonism caused by encephalitis, or parkinsonism caused by carbon monoxide or manganese poisoning.</p><p>Dopamine is a naturally occurring substance in the brain that helps provide control of movement and activities such as walking and talking. In patients with Parkinson's disease, there is not enough dopamine in some parts of the brain. Levodopa enters the brain and helps replace the missing dopamine, which allows people to function better. By increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain, levodopa helps control symptoms and helps you to perform daily activities such as dressing, walking, and handling utensils.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Sinemet 100/10</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Rytary® in the elderly.</p><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Lodosyn® have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of Lodosyn® in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Lodosyn®.</p><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of carbidopa and levodopa combination in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.
