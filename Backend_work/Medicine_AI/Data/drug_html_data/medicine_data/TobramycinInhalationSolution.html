</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Tobramycin Inhalation Solution</h2><p class="First">Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is indicated for the management of cystic fibrosis in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients under the age of 6 years, patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>) &lt;25% or &gt;75% predicted, or patients colonized with <span class="Italics">Burkholderia cepacia</span> <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h2>Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tobramycin Inhalation Solution</span> <span class="Bold">is for oral inhalation only</span> <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. The recommended dosage of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for both adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is one single-dose ampule (300 mg) administered twice daily for 28 days. Dosage is not adjusted by weight. All patients should be administered 300 mg twice daily.<br/>
<br/>
Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is administered twice daily in alternating periods of 28 days. After 28 days of therapy, patients should stop Tobramycin Inhalation Solution therapy for the next 28 days, and then resume therapy for the next 28 day on/28 day off cycle. The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible; they should not be taken less than 6 hours apart.<br/>
<br/>
If patients miss a dose, they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 6 hours prior to their next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, wait until their next scheduled dose.</p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is administered by oral inhalation over an approximately 15-minute period, using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor. Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer. Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is <span class="Italics">not</span> for subcutaneous, intravenous or intrathecal administration.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to administration of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, read the Patient Information/Instructions for Use for Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for detailed information on how to use Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use and care of the PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer and DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide air compressor. Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is inhaled while the patient is sitting or standing upright and breathing normally through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. Nose clips may help the patient breathe through the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Instruct patients on multiple therapies to take their medications, prior to inhaling Tobramycin Inhalation Solution or as directed by their physician.<br/>
<br/>
Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should not be used if it is cloudy, if there are particles in the solution, or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, USP is supplied as a sterile inhalational solution for nebulization in single-dose 5 mL ampules. Each 5 mL ampule contains 300 mg of tobramycin USP.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. In clinical studies with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, changes in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> measured after the inhaled dose were similar in Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and placebo groups. Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should be treated as medically appropriate.</p><h3>Ototoxicity</h3><p class="First">Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity, has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides.<br/>
<br/>
Transient tinnitus occurred in eight Tobramycin Inhalation Solution treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation. Ototoxicity, as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations, did not occur with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution therapy during clinical studies, however in postmarketing experience, patients receiving Tobramycin Inhalation Solution have reported hearing loss. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or dizziness. Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels. If ototoxicity is noted, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing Tobramycin Inhalation Solution.</p><h3>Nephrotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician. If nephrotoxicity develops, the patient should be managed as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing Tobramycin Inhalation Solution.</p><h3>Neuromuscular Disorders</h3><p class="First">Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. Neuromuscular blockade, respiratory failure, and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson’s disease. Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary.</p><h3>Embryo-fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides cross the placenta, and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed <span class="Italics">in utero</span>. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Patients who use Tobramycin Inhalation Solution during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving concomitant Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class. Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Bronchospasm <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Ototoxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Nephrotoxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>

<li>Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>
<br/>
Tobramycin Inhalation Solution was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years. Patients received Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;5% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution patients during the two Phase 3 studies.</p><p>Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5% of patients treated with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Ear and Labyrinth Disorders:</span></span> Tinnitus<br/>

<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><br/>
Infections and Infestations:</span></span> Laryngitis<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Voice Alteration and Tinnitus<br/></span><br/>
Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients. Thirty-three patients (13%) treated with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution complained of voice alteration compared to 17 (7%) placebo patients. Voice alteration was more common in the on-drug periods.<br/>
<br/>
Eight patients from the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group (3%) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients. All episodes were transient, resolved without discontinuation of the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution treatment regimen, and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms. Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity, and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss. The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and placebo groups.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Changes in Serum Creatinine<br/></span><br/>
Nine (3%) patients in the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group and nine (3%) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50% over baseline. In all nine patients in the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group, creatinine decreased at the next visit.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><br/>
Ear and Labyrinth Disorders<br/></span></span><br/>

Decreased appetite</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs with Neurotoxic, Nephrotoxic or Ototoxic Potential</h3><p class="First">Concurrent and/or sequential use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution with other drugs with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic, or ototoxic potential should be avoided.</p><h3>Diuretics</h3><p class="First">Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue. Tobramycin Inhalation Solution should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid, furosemide, urea, or intravenous mannitol. The interaction between inhaled mannitol and Tobramycin Inhalation Solution has not been evaluated.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span><br/>
Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm. Published literature reports that use of streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, can cause total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span> Although there are no available data on Tobramycin Inhalation Solution use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</span> In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there were no adverse developmental outcomes; however, ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.<br/>
<br/>
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk<br/></span><br/>
Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data<br/></span><br/>
No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (tobramycin administered by inhalation). However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 (rat) or 20 (rabbit) mg/kg/day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Doses of tobramycin ≥40 mg/kg/day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes. Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span><br/>
There are no data on the presence of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk. However, systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</span> The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tobramycin Inhalation Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Tobramycin Inhalation Solution or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First">Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established. The use of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution is not indicated in children &lt;6 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1) and Dosage and Administration (2)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution did not include patients aged 65 years and over. Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Signs and symptoms of acute toxicity from overdosage of intravenous (IV) tobramycin might include dizziness, tinnitus, vertigo, loss of high-tone hearing acuity, respiratory failure, neuromuscular blockade, and renal impairment. Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin. Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration. Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage.<br/>
<br/>
Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken.<br/>
<br/>
In all cases of suspected overdosage, physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment. In the case of any overdosage, the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered.<br/>
<br/>
Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body.</p><h2>Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, USP is a sterile, clear, slightly yellow, non-pyrogenic, aqueous solution with the pH and salinity adjusted specifically for administration by a compressed air driven reusable nebulizer. Tobramycin USP is a white or almost white powder. The chemical formula for tobramycin is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">37</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">9</span> and the molecular weight is 467.52 g/mol. Tobramycin is O-3-amino-3-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-[2,6-diamino-2,3,6­trideoxy-α-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1→6)]-2-deoxy-L-streptamine. The structural formula for tobramycin is:<br/>
<br/>
Each single-dose 5 mL ampule contains 300 mg tobramycin USP and 11.25 mg sodium chloride in water for injection. Sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide are added to adjust the pH to 6.0. Nitrogen is used for sparging. All ingredients meet USP requirements. The formulation contains no preservatives.</p><h2>Tobramycin Inhalation Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption<br/></span><br/>
Tobramycin Inhalation Solution contains tobramycin, a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes. <span class="Sup">(1)</span> The bioavailability of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology. <span class="Sup">(2)</span> Following administration of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Serum Concentrations<br/></span><br/>
The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300-mg dose of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution by cystic fibrosis patients was 0.95 mcg/mL. After 20 weeks of therapy on the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution regimen, the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1.05 mcg/mL.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Sputum Concentrations<br/></span><br/>
Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300-mg dose of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution by cystic fibrosis patients, the average concentration of tobramycin was 1,237 mcg/g (range 35 to 7,417 mcg/g) in sputum. Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum; after 20 weeks of therapy with the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution regimen, the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1,154 mcg/g (range 39 to 8,085 mcg/g) in sputum. Two hours after inhalation, sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14% of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Distribution<br/></span><br/>
Following administration of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways. Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Elimination<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Metabolism<br/></span><br/>
Tobramycin is not metabolized.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Excretion<br/></span><br/>
The elimination half-life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous (IV) administration and inhalation, respectively. Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration. Unabsorbed tobramycin, following Tobramycin Inhalation Solution administration, is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action<br/></span><br/>
Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by <span class="Italics">Streptomyces tenebrarius</span>.<span class="Sup">(1)</span> It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death.<span class="Sup">(3)</span></p><p>Tobramycin has <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> activity against gram-negative bacteria including <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>. It is bactericidal <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Resistance<br/></span><br/>
Treatment for 6 months with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> isolates tested; however, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were noted in some patients. The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> in cystic fibrosis patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Susceptibility Test Methods<br/></span><br/>
Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined. The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. If decreased susceptibility is noted, the results should be reported to the clinician.<br/>
<br/>
Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution. The relationship between <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution therapy is not clear.<br/>
<br/>
A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> and each morphotype may have a different level of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility to tobramycin.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">A two-year rat inhalation toxicology study to assess carcinogenic potential of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution has been completed. Rats were exposed to Tobramycin Inhalation Solution for up to 1.5 hours per day for 95 weeks. The clinical formulation of the drug was used for this carcinogenicity study. Serum levels of tobramycin of up to 35 mcg/mL were measured in rats, in contrast to the average 1 mcg/mL levels observed in cystic fibrosis patients in clinical trials. There was no drug-related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumor.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> tests. The Ames bacterial reversion test, conducted with 5 tester strains, failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains. Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test.<br/>
<br/>
Subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of tobramycin did not affect mating behavior or cause impairment of fertility in male or female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Two identically designed, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 24-week clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span>. Subjects who were less than 6 years of age, had a baseline creatinine of &gt;2 mg/dL, or had <span class="Italics">Burkholderia cepacia</span> isolated from sputum were excluded.<br/>
<br/>
All subjects had baseline FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>% predicted between 25% and 75%. In these clinical studies, 258 patients received Tobramycin Inhalation Solution therapy on an outpatient basis (see Table 2) using a hand-held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide compressor.</p><p>All patients received either Tobramycin Inhalation Solution or placebo (saline with 1.25 mg quinine for flavoring) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients, which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy, β<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, cromolyn, inhaled steroids, and airway clearance techniques. In addition, approximately 77% of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa (PULMOZYME, Genentech).<br/>
<br/>
In each study, Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function. Improvement was demonstrated in the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>% predicted of about 11% relative to baseline (Week 0) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients. In Study 2, Tobramycin Inhalation Solution-treated patients had an average increase of about 7% compared to an average decrease of about 1% in placebo patients. Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>% predicted over 24 weeks for both studies.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Relative Change from Baseline in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>% Predicted<br/>
</span></p><p>In each study, Tobramycin Inhalation Solution therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> colony forming units (CFUs) in sputum during the on-drug periods. Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off-drug periods. Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle (see Figure 2).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Absolute Change from Baseline in Log<span class="Sub">10</span> CFUs<br/>
</span></p><p>Patients treated with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution were hospitalized for an average of 5.1 days compared to 8.1 days for placebo patients. Patients treated with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution required an average of 9.6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterial treatment compared to 14.1 days for placebo patients. During the 6 months of treatment, 40% of Tobramycin Inhalation Solution patients and 53% of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship between <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution therapy is not clear. However, four Tobramycin Inhalation Solution patients who began the clinical trial with <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> isolates having MIC values ≥128 mcg/mL did not experience an improvement in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> or a decrease in sputum bacterial density.<br/>
<br/>
Treatment with Tobramycin Inhalation Solution did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> isolates during the 6-month studies. However, some <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs. The percentage of patients with <span class="Italics">P. aeruginosa</span> isolates with tobramycin MICs ≥16 mcg/mL was 13% at the beginning, and 23% at the end of 6 months of the Tobramycin Inhalation Solution regimen.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Tobramycin Inhalation Solution, USP is a sterile, clear, slightly yellow, non-pyrogenic, aqueous solution packaged in a 5 mL single-dose ampule (300 mg tobramycin USP) for nebulization and is supplied as follows:<br/>
