</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets</h2><p class="First">Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate.</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Amlodipine</span></p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine.</p><p>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</p><p>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</p><p>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.</p><p>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</p><p>Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.</p><h3>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Chronic Stable Angina</span></p><p>Amlodipine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents.</p><p><span class="Bold">Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal’s or Variant Angina)</span></p><p>Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Angiographically Documented CAD</span></p><p>In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction &lt; 40%, amlodipine is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.  </p><p><span class="Bold Underline">Atorvastatin</span></p><p>Therapy with HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (lipid-altering agents) should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease from hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or multiple risk factors for CHD, atorvastatin can be started simultaneously with diet restriction.</p><h3>Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in Adults</h3><p class="First">In adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or a family history of early coronary heart disease, atorvastatin is indicated to:</p><ul>
<li>Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI)</li>
<li>Reduce the risk of stroke</li>
<li>Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina</li>
</ul><p>In adult patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, atorvastatin is indicated to:</p><ul>
<li>Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction</li>
<li>Reduce the risk of stroke</li>
</ul><p>In adult patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, atorvastatin is indicated to:</p><ul>
<li>Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction</li>
<li>Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke</li>
<li>Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures</li>
<li>Reduce the risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF)</li>
<li>Reduce the risk of angina</li>
</ul><h3>Hyperlipidemia</h3><p class="First">Atorvastatin is indicated:</p><ul>
<li>As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and triglycerides (TG) levels and to increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia <span class="Italics">(Fredrickson</span> Types IIa and IIb)</li>
<li>As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of adult patients with elevated serum TG levels <span class="Italics">(Fredrickson</span> Type IV);</li>
<li>For the treatment of adult patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia <span class="Italics">(Fredrickson</span> Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet</li>
<li>To reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable</li>
<li>As an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in pediatric patients, 10 years to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present:</li>
</ul><p>a. LDL-C remains ≥ 190 mg/dL or</p><p>b. LDL-C remains ≥ 160 mg/dL and:</p><ul>
<li>there is a positive family history of premature CVD or</li>
<li>two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the pediatric patient</li>
</ul><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">Atorvastatin has not been studied in conditions where the major lipoprotein abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons (Fredrickson Types I and V).</p><h2>Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets</span></p><p>Dosage of Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and hyperlipidemia. Select doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin independently.  </p><p>Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of amlodipine and atorvastatin or a dose of amlodipine and atorvastatin with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect.  </p><p>Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p><p>The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.</p><p>Pediatric (age &gt; 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.  </p><p>Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.</p><p><span class="Italics">Angina:</span> The recommended dose of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.</p><p><span class="Italics">Coronary Artery Disease</span>: The recommended dose range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span>.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatrics</span>: The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 6 years to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.1</span>)].  </p><p><span class="Bold">Atorvastatin (Hyperlipidemia)</span></p><p>Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia: The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of atorvastatin is 10 mg to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of atorvastatin should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.</p><p><span class="Italics">Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia</span>: The dosage range of atorvastatin in patients with HoFH is 10 mg to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable.</p><p><span class="Italics">Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy</span>: Atorvastatin may be used with bile acid resins. Monitor for signs of myopathy in patients receiving the combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span>: Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations nor LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Use with Cyclosporine, Clarithromycin, Itraconazole, Letermovir, or Certain Protease Inhibitors: In patients taking cyclosporine or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor tipranavir plus ritonavir or the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, or letermovir when co-administered with cyclosporine, therapy with atorvastatin should be avoided. In patients with HIV taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, use the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin. In patients taking clarithromycin, itraconazole, elbasvir plus grazoprevir, or in patients with HIV taking a combination of saquinavir plus ritonavir, darunavir plus ritonavir, fosamprenavir, fosamprenavir plus ritonavir, or letermovir therapy with atorvastatin should be limited to 20 mg, and appropriate clinical assessment is recommended to ensure that the lowest dose necessary of atorvastatin is used. In patients taking the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir therapy with atorvastatin should be limited to 40 mg. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10 Years to 17 Years of Age)</span>: The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the usual dose range is 10 to 20 mg orally once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.11)]. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span>. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets, USP are formulated for oral administration in the following strength combinations:</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1</span></p><p>Combinations of atorvastatin with 5 mg amlodipine are film-coated white to off-white, and combinations of atorvastatin with 10 mg amlodipine are film-coated light blue.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">Active Liver Disease, Which May Include Unexplained Persistent Elevations in Hepatic Transaminase Levels</span><br/></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span> <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span> </li>
<li><span class="Bold">Lactation</span> <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)] </span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis</h3><p class="First">Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for Myopathy </span></p><p>Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher amlodipine and atorvastatin dosage <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis </span></p><p>Amlodipine and atorvastatin exposure may be increased by drug interactions due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or transporters (e.g., breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP], organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1/OATP1B3] and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), resulting in an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with amlodipine and atorvastatin is not recommended. Amlodipine and atorvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain anti-viral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with lipid modifying doses (&gt;1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir. Consider if the benefit of use of these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><p>Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).</p><p>Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the Amlodipine and atorvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.</p><h3>5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Consider risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of a different statin. If therapy is initiated with a different statin, monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM.</p><h3>Liver Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Statins, like atorvastatin, and some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (&gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively.</p><p>One patient in clinical trials with atorvastatin developed jaundice. Increases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin.</p><p>It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with atorvastatin and repeated as clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with amlodipine and atorvastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart amlodipine and atorvastatin.</p><p>Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of amlodipine and atorvastatin <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Increased Angina and Myocardial Infarction</h3><p class="First">Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.</p><h3>Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Symptomatic hypotension is possible with use of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely.</p><h3>Endocrine Function</h3><p class="First">Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin.</p><p>Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Avoid a statin with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine.</p><h3>CNS Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated with atorvastatin for 3 months at 120 mg/kg/day. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses up to 280 mg/kg/day. The 120 mg/kg dose resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area-under-the-curve (AUC, 0 to 24 hours) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated at 10 mg/kg/day and one at 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment for up to 2 years at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6 to 11 times (mouse) and 8 to 16 times (rat) the human AUC (0 to 24) based on the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg/day.</p><p>CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other statins. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose.</p><h3>Hemorrhagic Stroke</h3><p class="First">In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study where atorvastatin 80 mg vs. placebo was administered in 4,731 subjects without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul>

<li>Liver enzyme abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Amlodipine and Atorvastatin</span></p><p>Amlodipine and atorvastatin has been evaluated for safety in 1,092 patients in double-blind placebo-controlled studies treated for co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. In general, treatment with amlodipine and atorvastatin was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse reactions have been mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials with amlodipine and atorvastatin, no adverse reactions peculiar to this combination have been observed. Adverse reactions are similar in terms of nature, severity, and frequency to those reported previously with amlodipine and atorvastatin.</p><p>The following information is based on the clinical experience with amlodipine and atorvastatin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p><p>Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N=1,730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1,250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%).

The amlodipine component of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The atorvastatin component of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol.</p><p><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p><p>Amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine.  </p><p>Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.</p><p>The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following:</p><p><span class="Italics">Exertional Angina</span>: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.</p><p><span class="Italics">Vasospastic Angina</span>: Amlodipine has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro. This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine in vasospastic (Prinzmetal’s or variant) angina.</p><p><span class="Bold">Atorvastatin</span></p><p>Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Amlodipine</span></p><p>Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.  </p><p>With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/–2 mmHg).</p><p>In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.</p><p>As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.</p><p>Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Atorvastatin</span></p><p>Atorvastatin, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance.

Extent of absorption increases in proportion to atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><p>Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets: Following oral administration of Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets, peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine and atorvastatin are seen at 6 to 12 hours and 1 to 2 hours post dosing, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption (bioavailability) of amlodipine and atorvastatin from Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets are not significantly different from the bioavailability of amlodipine and atorvastatin administered separately (see above).  </p><p>The bioavailability of amlodipine from Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets was not affected by food. Food decreases the rate and extent of absorption of atorvastatin from Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets by approximately 32% and 11%, respectively, as it does with atorvastatin when given alone.

In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P4503A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose.

In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).</p><h3>Amlodipine for Vasospastic Angina</h3><p class="First">In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p&lt;0.01).

Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD.</p><p>CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main coronary disease and without heart failure or an ejection fraction &lt;40%. Patients (76% males, 89% Caucasian, 93% enrolled at U.S. sites, 89% with a history of angina, 52% without PCI, 4% with PCI and no stent, and 44% with a stent) were randomized to double-blind treatment with either amlodipine (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89%), statins (83%), beta-blockers (74%), nitroglycerin (50%), anticoagulants (40%), and diuretics (32%), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events: hospitalization for angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease. A total of 110 (16.6%) and 151 (23.1%) first events occurred in the amlodipine and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.540 to 0.884, p = 0.003).

In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular ejection fraction. In a long-term (follow-up at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo-controlled mortality/morbidity study of amlodipine 5 mg to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n=931) or IV (n=222) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, amlodipine had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of heart failure. Total combined all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222/571 (39%) for patients on amlodipine and 246/583 (42%) for patients on placebo; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25% of the endpoints in the study.</p><p>Another study (PRAISE-2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%), to placebo (n=827) or amlodipine (n=827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine and placebo in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on amlodipine). With amlodipine there were more reports of pulmonary edema.</p><h3>Atorvastatin for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease</h3><p class="First">In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), the effect of atorvastatin on fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 40 years to 80 years of age (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with total-C levels ≤ 251 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors: male gender (81.1%), age &gt; 55 years (84.5%), smoking (33.2%), diabetes (24.3%), history of CHD in a first-degree relative (26%), TC:HDL &gt; 6 (14.3%), peripheral vascular disease (5.1%), left ventricular hypertrophy (14.4%), prior cerebrovascular event (9.8%), specific ECG abnormality (14.3%), proteinuria/albuminuria (62.4%). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with anti-hypertensive therapy (Goal BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg for non-diabetic patients; &lt; 130/80 mm Hg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n=5168) or placebo (n=5137), using a covariate adaptive method that took into account the distribution of nine baseline characteristics of patients already enrolled and minimized the imbalance of those characteristics across the groups. Patients were followed for a median duration of 3.3 years.</p><p>The effect of 10 mg/day of atorvastatin on lipid levels was similar to that seen in previous clinical trials.</p><p>Atorvastatin significantly reduced the rate of coronary events [either fatal coronary heart disease (46 events in the placebo group vs. 40 events in the atorvastatin group) or non-fatal MI (108 events in the placebo group vs. 60 events in the atorvastatin group)] with a relative risk reduction of 36% [(based on incidences of 1.9% for atorvastatin vs. 3.0% for placebo), p=0.0005 (see Figure 3)].

Patients were mainly male (81%), white (99%) with an average age of 61.7 years, and an average LDL-C of 121.5 mg/dL at randomization; 76% were on statin therapy. In this prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial with no run-in period, subjects were followed for a median duration of 4.8 years.

Additionally, analysis of the pooled data demonstrated consistent and significant decreases in total-C, LDL-C, TG, total-C/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C.</p><p>In three multicenter, double-blind studies in patients with hyperlipidemia, atorvastatin was compared to other statins. After randomization, patients were treated for 16 weeks with either atorvastatin 10 mg per day or a fixed dose of the comparative agent (Table 11).</p><p>The impact on clinical outcomes of the differences in lipid-altering effects between treatments shown in Table 11 is not known. Table 11 does not contain data comparing the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg and higher doses of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin.

For the atorvastatin-treated patients, median (min, max) baseline TG level was 565 (267 to 1502).</p><h3>Atorvastatin for Dysbetalipoproteinemia</h3><p class="First">The results of an open-label crossover study of 16 patients (genotypes: 14 apo E2/E2 and 2 apo E3/E2) with dysbetalipoproteinemia <span class="Italics">(Fredrickson</span> Type III) are shown in the table below (Table 13).</p><h3>Atorvastatin for Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia</h3><p class="First">In a study without a concurrent control group, 29 patients ages 6 years to 37 years with HoFH received maximum daily doses of 20 mg to 80 mg of atorvastatin. The mean LDL-C reduction in this study was 18%. Twenty-five patients with a reduction in LDL-C had a mean response of 20% (range of 7% to 53%, median of 24%); the remaining 4 patients had 7% to 24% increases in LDL-C. Five of the 29 patients had absent LDL-receptor function. Of these, 2 patients also had a portacaval shunt and had no significant reduction in LDL-C. The remaining 3 receptor-negative patients had a mean LDL-C reduction of 22%.</p><h3>Atorvastatin for Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an open-label phase, 187 boys and post-menarchal girls 10 years to 17 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with HeFH or severe hypercholesterolemia, were randomized to atorvastatin (n=140) or placebo (n=47) for 26 weeks and then all received atorvastatin for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required 1) a baseline LDL-C level ≥ 190 mg/dL or 2) a baseline LDL-C level ≥ 160 mg/dL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or second-degree relative. The mean baseline LDL-C value was 218.6 mg/dL (range: 138.5 to 385.0 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group compared to 230.0 mg/dL (range: 160.0 to 324.5 mg/dL) in the placebo group. The dosage of atorvastatin (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDL-C level was &gt; 130 mg/dL. The number of atorvastatin-treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the double-blind phase was 78 (55.7 %). </p><p>Atorvastatin significantly decreased plasma levels of total-C, LDL-C, TG, and apolipoprotein B during the 26-week double-blind phase (see Table 14).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 14. Lipid-Altering Effects of Atorvastatin in Adolescent Boys and Girls with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Severe Hypercholesterolemia (Mean Percentage Change from Baseline at Endpoint in Intention-to-Treat Population)</span></p><p>The mean achieved LDL-C value was 130.7 mg/dL (range: 70.0 to 242.0 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group compared to 228.5 mg/dL (range: 152.0 to 385.0 mg/dL) in the placebo group during the 26-week double-blind phase.</p><p>Atorvastatin was also studied in a three year open-label, uncontrolled trial that included 163 patients with HeFH who were 10 years to 15 years old (82 boys and 81 girls). All patients had a clinical diagnosis of HeFH confirmed by genetic analysis (if not already confirmed by family history). Approximately 98% were Caucasian, and less than 1% were Black or Asian. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 232 mg/dL. The starting atorvastatin dosage was 10 mg once daily and doses were adjusted to achieve a target of &lt;130 mg/dL LDL-C. The reductions in LDL-C from baseline were generally consistent across age groups within the trial as well as with previous clinical studies in both adult and pediatric placebo-controlled trials.</p><h3>Amlodipine and Atorvastatin for Hypertension and Dyslipidemia</h3><p class="First">In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 1660 patients with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia received once daily treatment with eight dose combinations of amlodipine and atorvastatin (5/10, 10/10, 5/20, 10/20, 5/40, 10/40, 5/80, or 10/80 mg), amlodipine alone (5 mg or 10 mg), atorvastatin alone (10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg), or placebo<span class="Bold">.</span> In addition to concomitant hypertension and dyslipidemia, 15% of the patients had diabetes mellitus, 22% were smokers, and 14% had a positive family history of cardiovascular disease. At eight weeks, all eight combination-treatment groups of amlodipine and atorvastatin demonstrated statistically significant dose-related reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and LDL-C compared to placebo, with no overall modification of effect of either component on SBP, DBP, and LDL-C (Table 15).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets,  USP contain amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium, in the form of propylene glycol solvate, equivalent to amlodipine and atorvastatin in the dose strengths described below.</p><p><br/>
