Urea also hydrates and gently dissolves the intercellular matrix of the nail plate, which can result in the softening and eventual debridement of the nail plate.</p><h3>PHARMACOKINETICS</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of topically applied Urea is not yet known.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USES:</h2><p class="First">For debridement and promotion of normal healing of hyperkeratotic surface lesions, particularly where healing is retarded by local infection, necrotic tissue, fibrinous or prurient debris or eschar. Urea is useful for the treatment of hyperkeratotic conditions such as dry, rough skin, dermatitis, psoriasis, xerosis, ichthyosis, eczema, keratosis, keratoderma, corns and calluses, as well as damaged, ingrown and devitalized nails.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Known hypersensitivity to any of the listed ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">For external use only.

KEEP THIS AND ALL MEDICATION OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</span></p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus, however, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

Because many drugs are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">X-VIATE</span>™ is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Transient stinging, burning, itching or irritation may occur and normally disappear on discontinuing the medication.</p><h2>X-Viate Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply <span class="Bold">X-VIATE</span>™ to affected skin twice per day or as directed by a physician.
