Symptom onset may occur well after initiation of treatment and without any warning signs; some events have occurred more than 1 year after start of therapy. Prior to treatment initiation, evaluate for factors that may increase these risks such as concomitant sedating medications and the presence of sleep disorders. Monitor for drowsiness or sleepiness. If significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation occurs (eg, driving, conversations, eating), discontinue the medication. There is insufficient information to suggest that dose reductions will eliminate these symptoms.</p><p>• Dyskinesias: May cause or exacerbate dyskinesias; may require dosage reduction or discontinuation.</p><p>• Hallucinations: Hallucinations may occur and be accompanied by confusion, and to a lesser extent, sleep disorder and excessive dreaming; may require dose reduction.</p><p>• Impulse control disorders: Dopamine agonists used for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome have been associated with compulsive behaviors and/or loss of impulse control, which has manifested as pathological gambling, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges. Dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy have been reported to reverse these behaviors in some, but not all cases.</p><p>• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction or abrupt withdrawal. Identification of more severe NMS-like reactions (eg, altered consciousness, hyperthermia, involuntary movements, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, mental status changes) can be complex; monitor patients closely for this reaction and when the dosage of levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued. Discontinue treatment immediately if signs/symptoms arise.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Glaucoma: May cause increased IOP in patients with glaucoma; monitor IOP.</p><p>• Psychotic disorders: May exacerbate psychosis; avoid use in patients with a major psychotic disorder.</p><p>• Respiratory disease: May cause bronchospasm; use is not recommended in patients with respiratory disease.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Body fluid discoloration: Urine, saliva, or sweat may appear dark in color (red, brown, black) during therapy.</p><p>• Discontinuation of therapy: Dopaminergic agents have been associated with a syndrome resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome on abrupt withdrawal, rapid dose reduction, significant dosage reduction after long-term use, or changes in dopaminergic therapy. Avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction; taper dose to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Hepatic function test, BUN, CBC and direct antiglobulin (as clinically indicated); intraocular pressure (as clinically indicated in patients with glaucoma)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Levodopa crosses the placenta following administration of oral tablets (Seier 2017).</p><p>Although data related to the use of levodopa in pregnancy is limited, information following maternal use of the oral tablets is available (Seier 2017).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat "off" episodes (when a dose wears off) in people with Parkinsons disease.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
