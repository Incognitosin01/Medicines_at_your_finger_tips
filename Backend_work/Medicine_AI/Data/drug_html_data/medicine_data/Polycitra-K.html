Citrates are sometimes used with other medicines to help treat kidney stones that may occur with gout. They are also used to make the blood more alkaline in certain conditions</p><p>Citrates are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Polycitra-K</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of citrates in children with use in other age groups, these medicines are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than they do in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of citrates in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Studies on effects in pregnancy have not been done in either humans or animals.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Although it is not known whether citrates pass into the breast milk, this medicine has not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Addison's disease (underactive adrenal glands) or</li>
<li>Type 2 diabetes mellitus or</li>
<li>Kidney disease—The potassium in potassium-containing citrates may worsen or cause heart problems in patients with these conditions.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Diarrhea (chronic)—Treatment with citrates may not be effective; a change in dose of citrate may be needed.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Edema (swelling of the feet or lower legs) or</li>
<li>High blood pressure or</li>
<li>Toxemia of pregnancy—The sodium in sodium-containing citrates may cause the body to retain (keep) water.</li>

</ul><ul>
<li>Intestinal or esophageal blockage—Potassium citrate tablets may cause irritation of the stomach or intestines.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Stomach ulcer or other stomach problems—Potassium citrate–containing products may make these conditions worse.</li>
