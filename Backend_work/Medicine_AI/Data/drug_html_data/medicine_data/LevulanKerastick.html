</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Levulan Kerastick</h2><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The Levulan Kerastick for topical solution plus blue light illumination using the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator is indicated for the treatment of minimally to moderately thick actinic keratoses of the face, scalp, or upper extremities.</span></p><h2>Levulan Kerastick Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Preparation and Administration Overview</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">After mixing, the Levulan Kerastick topical solution 20% is intended for direct application to individual lesions diagnosed as actinic keratoses and not to perilesional skin. This product is not intended for application by patients or unqualified medical personnel.  Application should involve lesions on the scalp, face or upper extremities; multiple lesions can be treated within a treatment region, but multiple treatment regions should not be treated simultaneously.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The recommended treatment frequency is: one application of the Levulan Kerastick topical solution and one dose of illumination per treatment region per 8-week treatment session. Each individual Levulan Kerastick applicator should be used for only one patient.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Levulan Kerastick photodynamic therapy for actinic keratoses is a two-stage process involving application of the Levulan Kerastick topical solution to the target lesions and then illumination with blue light using the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator after 3 hours for upper extremity lesions or after 14-18 hours for face or scalp lesions.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levulan Kerastick topical solution application</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Time window<span class="Sup">1</span> for Blue Light Illumination for face or scalp</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Time window<span class="Sup">2</span> for Blue Light Illumination for upper extremities</span></p><p class="First">6 am</p><p class="First">8 pm to Midnight</p><p class="First">9 am</p><p class="First">7 am</p><p class="First">9 pm to 1 am</p><p class="First">10 am</p><p class="First">8 am</p><p class="First">10 pm to 2 am</p><p class="First">11 am</p><p class="First">9 am</p><p class="First">11 pm to 3 am</p><p class="First">12 Noon</p><p class="First">10 am</p><p class="First">Midnight to 4 am</p><p class="First">1 pm</p><p class="First">11 am</p><p class="First">1 am to 5 am</p><p class="First">2 pm</p><p class="First">12 pm</p><p class="First">2 am to 6 am</p><p class="First">3 pm</p><p class="First">1 pm</p><p class="First">3 am to 7 am</p><p class="First">4 pm</p><p class="First">2 pm</p><p class="First">4 am to 8 am</p><p class="First">5 pm</p><p class="First">3 pm</p><p class="First">5 am to 9 am</p><p class="First">6 pm</p><p class="First">4 pm</p><p class="First">6 am to 10 am</p><p class="First">7 pm</p><p class="First">5 pm</p><p class="First">7 am to 11 am</p><p class="First">8 pm</p><p class="First">6 pm</p><p class="First">8 am to Noon</p><p class="First">9 pm</p><p class="First">7 pm</p><p class="First">9 am to 1 pm</p><p class="First">10 pm</p><p class="First">8 pm</p><p class="First">10 am to 2 pm</p><p class="First">11 pm</p><p class="First">9 pm</p><p class="First">11 am to 3 pm</p><p class="First">12 Midnight</p><p class="First">10 pm</p><p class="First">Noon to 4 pm</p><p class="First">1 am</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">If for any reason the patient cannot be given BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator treatment during the prescribed time after applying Levulan Kerastick topical solution, he or she may nonetheless experience sensations of stinging and/or burning if the photosensitized actinic keratoses are exposed to sunlight or prolonged or intense light at that time. Advise the patient to wear appropriate protective apparel (e.g., wide-brimmed hat, long sleeve shirt, gloves) to shade the treated actinic keratoses from sunlight or other bright light sources until at least 40 hours after the application of Levulan Kerastick topical solution. Advise the patient to reduce light exposure if the sensations of stinging and/or burning are experienced.</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Levulan Kerastick photodynamic therapy may be repeated a second time for lesions that have not completely resolved 8 weeks after the initial treatment.</span></p><h3>Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Step A - Treatment of Actinic Keratoses with Levulan Kerastick Topical Solution</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Preparation of Lesions</span></p><p>Actinic keratoses targeted for treatment should be clean and dry prior to application of Levulan Kerastick Topical Solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Preparation of Levulan Kerastick topical solution</span></p><p>The Levulan Kerastick applicator consists of a plastic tube containing two sealed glass ampules and an applicator tip. One ampule contains 1.5 mL of solution vehicle. The other ampule contains aminolevulinic acid HCl as a dry solid. Levulan Kerastick topical solution is prepared by crushing the glass ampoules and mixing the contents together.</p><p>The Levulan Kerastick topical solution can be prepared either manually, or using the optional KERASTICK KRUSHER™.  These methods are illustrated below.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1:   Manual Preparation:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2:  Optional KERASTICK KRUSHER Preparation:</span></p><p>The Levulan Kerastick topical solution must be used within two (2) hours of activation. If the solution is not completely applied within 2 hours of the activation, discard the applicator. If needed, use a new Levulan Kerastick applicator.</p><p><span class="Bold">Application of Levulan Kerastick topical solution</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Application of Levulan Kerastick topical solution to Face or Scalp Lesions:</span></p><p>Following solution admixture, remove the cap from the Levulan Kerastick applicator. The dry applicator tip should be dabbed on a gauze pad until uniformly wet with solution.  Apply the solution directly to the target lesions by dabbing gently with the wet applicator tip. Enough solution should be applied to uniformly wet the lesion surface, including the edges without excess running or dripping. Once the initial application has dried, apply again in the same manner.</p><p>Do not apply the Levulan Kerastick topical solution to the periorbital area or allow it to contact ocular or mucosal surfaces.</p><p>Photosensitization of the treated lesions will take place over the next 14-18 hours. The actinic keratoses should not be washed during this time. The patient should be advised to wear a wide-brimmed hat or other protective apparel to shade the treated actinic keratoses from sunlight or other bright light sources until BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator treatment. The patient should be advised to reduce light exposure if the sensations of stinging and/or burning are experienced.</p><p>At the visit for light illumination before treatment, the actinic keratoses treated with the Levulan Kerastick topical solution should be gently rinsed with water and patted dry.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">For Lesions on the Upper Extremities</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Following solution mixture, remove the cap from the Levulan Kerastick applicator. The dry applicator tip should be dabbed on a gauze pad until uniformly wet with solution.  Apply the solution directly to the target lesions by dabbing gently with the wet applicator tip. Enough solution should be applied to uniformly wet the lesion surface, including the edges without excess running or dripping.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Occlude the upper extremity with low density polyethylene plastic wrap and hold in place with an elastic net dressing.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Figure 3: Method of Occlusion for Upper Extremities</span></span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">The patient should wear a long-sleeved shirt and/or gloves or other protective apparel to shade the treated actinic keratoses from sunlight or other bright light sources until BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator treatment. Photosensitization of the treated lesions will take place over the next 3 hours. The actinic keratoses should not be washed during this time. Remove the occlusive dressing prior to light treatment and gently rinse the treated area(s) with water and pat dry before light illumination.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Step B - Administration of BLU-U Treatment:</span></p><p>Levulan Kerastick is not intended for use with any device other than the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Use of Levulan Kerastick without subsequent BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator illumination is not recommended.</p><p>Photoactivation of actinic keratoses treated with Levulan Kerastick topical solution is accomplished with illumination from the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. A 1000 second (16 minutes 40 seconds) exposure is required to provide a 10 J/cm<span class="Sup">2</span> light dose. During light treatment, both patients and medical personnel should be provided with blue blocking protective eyewear, as specified in the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator Operating Instructions. Please refer to the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator Operating Instructions for further information on conducting the light treatment. Patients should be advised that transient stinging and/or burning at the target lesion sites occurs during the period of light exposure.</p><p>If blue light treatment with the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator is interrupted or stopped for any reason, it should not be restarted and the patient should be advised to protect the treated lesions from exposure to sunlight or prolonged or intense light for at least 40 hours after applying the Levulan Kerastick topical solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">For patients with facial lesions</span>:</p><p><span class="Bold">For patients with scalp lesions:</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">For patients with upper extremity lesions:</span></span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For topical solution: 354 mg of aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride as a powder in a plastic applicator device.  Upon mixture, Levulan Kerastick is a topical solution containing 20% aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA HCl) by weight.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">The Levulan Kerastick for topical solution plus blue light illumination using the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator is contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Transient Amnestic Episodes</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Transient amnestic episodes have been reported during postmarketing use of Levulan Kerastick in combination with BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Inform patients and their caregivers that Levulan Kerastick in combination with PDT may cause transient amnestic episodes. Advise them to contact the healthcare provider if the patient develops amnesia after treatment.</span></p><h3>Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">After Levulan Kerastick topical solution has been applied, the treatment site will become photosensitive and patients should avoid exposure of the photosensitive treatment sites to sunlight or bright indoor light (e.g., examination lamps, operating room lamps, tanning beds, or lights at close proximity) for 40 hours. Exposure may result in a stinging and/or burning sensation and may cause erythema and/or edema of the lesions.</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Therefore, before exposure to sunlight, patients should protect treated lesions from the sun by wearing a wide-brimmed hat or similar head covering of light-opaque material, and/or a long-sleeved shirt and/or gloves. Sunscreens will not protect against photosensitivity reactions caused by visible light. It has not been determined if perspiration can spread the Levulan Kerastick topical solution outside the treatment site to the eye or surrounding skin.</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Application of Levulan Kerastick topical solution to perilesional areas of photodamaged skin of the face, scalp or upper extremities may result in photosensitization. Upon exposure to activating light from the BLU-U, such photosensitized skin may produce a stinging and/or burning sensation and may become erythematous and/or edematous in a manner similar to that of actinic keratoses treated with Levulan Kerastick Photodynamic Therapy.  Because of the potential for skin to become photosensitized, the Levulan Kerastick topical solution should be used by a qualified health professional to apply drug to no more than 5mm of perilesional skin surrounding the target actinic keratosis lesions.</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">If for any reason the patient cannot return for blue light treatment during the prescribed period after applying Levulan Kerastick topical solution, the patient should call the doctor. The patient should also continue to avoid exposure of the photosensitized lesions to sunlight or prolonged or intense light for at least 40 hours. If stinging and/or burning is noted, exposure to light should be reduced.</span></p><h3>Irritation</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The Levulan Kerastick topical solution contains alcohol and is intended for topical use only. Irritation may be experienced if this product is applied to eyes or mucous membranes.  Do not apply to the eyes or to mucous membranes. Excessive irritation may be experienced if this product is applied under occlusion longer than 3 hours.</span></p><h3>Coagulation Defects</h3><p class="First">The Levulan Kerastick for topical solution has not been tested on patients with inherited or acquired coagulation defects.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in the other sections of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rate observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In clinical trials, no non-cutaneous adverse events were found to be consistently associated with Levulan Kerastick photodynamic therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Photodynamic Therapy Response:</span> The constellation of transient local symptoms of stinging and/or burning, itching, erythema and edema as a result of Levulan Kerastick photodynamic therapy (PDT) was observed in all clinical trials for actinic keratoses treatment. Stinging and/or burning subsided between 1 minute and 24 hours after the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator was turned off, and appeared qualitatively similar to that perceived by patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria upon exposure to sunlight. There was no clear drug dose or light dose dependent change in the incidence or severity of stinging and/or burning.</p><p>Local skin reactions at the application site were observed in 99% of subjects treated with Levulan Kerastick topical solution and BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. The most common local adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were application site stinging/burning, erythema, edema, scaling/crusting, hypo/hyperpigmentation, itching, erosion, oozing/vesiculation/crusting, dryness.</p><p>In the trials for face and scalp lesions, severe stinging and/or burning at one or more lesions during light treatment was reported by at least 50% of subjects.  Severe stinging and/or burning also occurred during light treatment in 9% of subjects receiving treatment for upper extremity lesions. The majority of subjects reported that all lesions treated exhibited at least slight stinging and/or burning.  In trials of the face and scalp, the sensation of stinging/burning appeared to reach a plateau at 6 minutes into the treatment. Less than 3% of subjects receiving treatment for face or scalp lesions discontinued light treatment because of stinging/burning. No subjects discontinued light treatment in the trial for upper extremity lesions.</p><p>In trials for the face or scalp lesions, 99% of the active treatment group and 79% of the vehicle group experienced erythema shortly after treatment. In the trial for the upper extremity lesions, 99% of Levulan Kerastick topical solution treatment group and 52% of the vehicle group experienced erythema on visit Days 2-3. Approximately 35% of Levulan Kerastick topical solution group had edema, while edema occurred in <span class="Bold">&lt;</span>1% of the vehicle group. Both erythema and edema resolved to baseline or improved by 4 weeks after therapy for face or scalp. Edema resolved by 4 weeks and erythema resolved to baseline by 8 weeks for upper extremities.</p><p>The application of Levulan Kerastick topical solution to perilesional skin resulted in stinging, burning, erythema and edema similar to treated actinic keratoses <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Localized Cutaneous Adverse Experiences:</span>Table 2 depicts the incidence and severity of cutaneous adverse events in trials for the face and scalp.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FACE</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SCALP</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levulan Kerastick Topical Solution + PDT (n=139)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vehicle + PDT  (n=41)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levulan Kerastick Topical Solution + PDT</span><br/>

It is, however, possible that concomitant use of other known photosensitizing agents such as St. John’s wort, griseofulvin, thiazide diuretics, sulfonylureas, phenothiazines, sulfonamides and tetracyclines might increase the photosensitivity reaction of actinic keratoses treated with Levulan Kerastick topical solution <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited available data with Levulan Kerastick topical solution use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Animal developmental toxicology studies were not conducted with aminolevulinic acid.  Levulan Kerastick solution has low systemic absorption following topical administration, and the risk of maternal use resulting in fetal exposure to the drug is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of Levulan Kerastick topical solution in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Levulan Kerastick topical solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfeeding child from Levulan Kerastick topical solution or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established. Actinic keratosis is not a disease generally seen in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 512 subjects in Phase 3 clinical trials of Levulan Kerastick topical solution, 63% (321/512) were 65 years old and over, while 24% (123/512) were 75 years old and over.  No overall differences in safety or substantial differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Levulan Kerastick Topical Solution Overdose</h3><p class="First">In the event that the drug is ingested, monitoring and supportive care are recommended. The patient should be advised to avoid incidental exposure to intense light sources for at least 40 hours after ingestion.  The consequences of exceeding the recommended topical dosage are unknown.</p><h3>BLU-U Light Overdose</h3><p class="First">There is no information on overdose of blue light from the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator following Levulan Kerastick topical solution application.</p><h2>Levulan Kerastick Description</h2><p class="First">Levulan Kerastick (aminolevulinic acid HCl) for topical solution, 20%, a porphyrin precursor, contains the hydrochloride salt of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an endogenous 5-carbon aminoketone.</p><p>ALA HCl is a white to off-white, odorless crystalline solid that is very soluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol, and practically insoluble in chloroform, hexane and mineral oil.</p><p>The chemical name for ALA HCl is 5-amino-4-oxopentanoic acid hydrochloride (MW = 167.59). The structural formula is represented below:</p><p>The Levulan Kerastick for topical solution applicator is a two-component system consisting of a plastic tube containing two sealed glass ampules and an applicator tip. One ampule contains 1.5 mL of solution vehicle comprising alcohol USP (ethanol content = 48% v/v), water, laureth-4, isopropyl alcohol, and polyethylene glycol. The other ampule contains 354 mg of aminolevulinic acid HCl as a dry solid. The applicator tube is enclosed in a protective cardboard sleeve and cap. The 20% topical solution is prepared just prior to the time of use by breaking the ampules and mixing the contents by shaking the Levulan Kerastick applicator. “Levulan Kerastick for topical solution” refers to the drug product in its unmixed state, “Levulan Kerastick topical solution” refers to the mixed drug product (in the applicator tube or after application), and “Levulan Kerastick” refers to the applicator only.</p><h2>Levulan Kerastick - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Following the application of Levulan Kerastick topical solution, photosensitization occurs through the metabolic conversion of aminolevulinic acid to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a photosensitizer, which accumulates in the skin.</p><p>When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated photoactive porphyrins produce a photodynamic reaction, resulting in a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of oxygen.  The absorption of light results in an excited state of porphyrin molecules, and subsequent spin transfer from photoreactive porphyrins to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.  Levulan Kerastick Photodynamic Therapy of actinic keratoses is the combination of photosensitization by application of the Levulan Kerastick topical solution to the lesions and subsequent illumination with BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">ALA does not exhibit fluorescence, while PpIX has a high fluorescence yield.  Time-dependent changes in surface fluorescence have been used to determine PpIX accumulation and clearance in actinic keratoses and perilesional skin after application of the Levulan Kerastick topical solution in 12 subjects.  Peak fluorescence intensity was reached in 11 ± 1 hr in actinic keratoses and 12 ± 1 hr in perilesional skin.  The mean clearance half-life of fluorescence for lesions was 30 ± 10 hr and 28 ± 6 hr for perilesional skin. The fluorescence in perilesional skin was similar to that in actinic keratoses.  Therefore, the Levulan Kerastick topical solution should only be applied to the affected skin.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Two human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted in subjects with minimally to moderately thick actinic keratoses on the upper extremities, having at least 6 lesions on one upper extremity and at least 12 lesions on the other upper extremity.  A single dose comprising of two topical applications of Levulan Kerastick topical solution (each containing 354 mg ALA HCl) were directly applied to the lesions and occluded for 3 hours prior to light treatment.</p><p>The first PK study was conducted in 29 subjects and PK parameters of ALA were assessed. The baseline-corrected mean ± SD of the maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of ALA was 249.9 ± 694.5 ng/mL and the median time to reach C<span class="Sub">max</span> (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 2 hr post dose.  The mean ± SD exposure to ALA, as expressed by area under the concentration time curve (AUC<span class="Sub">t</span>) was 669.9 ± 1610 ng∙hr/mL.  The mean ± SD elimination half-life (T<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of ALA was 5.7 ± 3.9 hr.</p><p>A second PK study was conducted in 14 subjects and PK parameters of ALA and PpIX were measured.  The baseline-corrected PpIX concentrations were negative in at least 50% of samples in 50% (7/14) subjects and AUC could not be estimated reliably.   The baseline-corrected mean ± SD of C<span class="Sub">max</span> for ALA and PpIX was 95.6 ± 120.6 ng/mL and 0.95 ± 0.71 ng/mL, respectively.  The median T<span class="Sub">max</span> of ALA and PpIX was 2 hr post dose and 12 hr post dose, respectively.  The mean AUC<span class="Sub">t</span> of ALA was 261.1 ± 229.3 ng∙hr/mL.  The mean ± SD T<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of ALA was 8.5 ± 6.7 hr.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No carcinogenicity testing has been carried out using ALA. No evidence of mutagenic effects was seen in four studies conducted with ALA to evaluate this potential. In the <span class="Italics">Salmonella-Escherichia coli</span>/mammalian microsome reverse mutation assay (Ames mutagenicity assay), no increases in the number of revertants were observed with any of the tester strains. In the <span class="Italics">Salmonella-Escherichia coli</span>/mammalian microsome reverse mutation assay in the presence of solar light radiation (Ames mutagenicity assay with light), ALA did not cause an increase in the number of revertants per plate of any of the tester strains in the presence or absence of simulated solar light. In the L5178Y TK± mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, ALA was evaluated as negative with and without metabolic activation under the study conditions. PpIX formation was not demonstrated in any of these in vitro studies. In the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, ALA was considered negative under the study exposure conditions. In contrast, at least one report in the literature has noted genotoxic effects in cultured rat hepatocytes after ALA exposure with PpIX formation. Other studies have documented oxidative DNA damage in vivo and in vitro as a result of ALA exposure.</p><p>No assessment of effects of ALA HCl on fertility has been performed in laboratory animals. It is unknown what effects systemic exposure to ALA HCl might have on fertility or reproductive function.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Actinic Keratoses of the Face or Scalp</h3><p class="First">Levulan Kerastick for topical solution plus blue light at 6-10.9 J/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>, has been used to treat actinic keratoses of the face or scalp in 342 subjects in seven clinical trials. Phase 3 trials ALA-018 and ALA-019 were two, identically designed, multicenter, two-arm trials using Levulan Kerastick topical solution plus illumination from the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator for 1000 seconds (16 minutes and 40 seconds) for a nominal exposure of 10 J/cm<span class="Sup">2</span>.  Subjects were excluded from these trials who had a history of cutaneous photosensitization, porphyria, hypersensitivity to porphyrins, photodermatosis, or inherited or acquired coagulation defects. A minimum of 4 and a maximum of 15 clinically typical, discrete, Grade 1 (slightly palpable actinic keratoses: better felt than seen), or Grade 2 (moderately thick actinic keratoses: easily seen and felt) target actinic keratoses were identified (see Table 5 for definitions). Target lesions on the face or on the scalp, but not on both locations in the same subject, received treatment. The subjects were randomized to receive treatment either with the Levulan Kerastick topical solution plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator or vehicle plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Subjects were randomized at a 3 to 1 Levulan Kerastick topical solution to vehicle ratio. A total of 243 subjects were enrolled in two Phase 3 trials (ALA-018, ALA-019). Lesions were designated as cleared (complete response) if the lesion had completely cleared and adherent scaling plaques of actinic keratoses were no longer evident on the surface of the treated skin when palpated. The percentage of subjects in whom 75% or more of treated lesions were cleared, and the percentage of subjects in whom 100% of treated lesions were cleared (Complete Responders), for each trial 8 weeks after treatment are shown in Table 4.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALA-018</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALA-019</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levulan Kerastick Topical Solution + PDT</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vehicle + PDT</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levulan Kerastick Topical Solution + PDT</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vehicle + PDT</span></p><p class="First"> Subjects with <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 75% of AK Lesions Cleared</p><p class="First">Total No. Subjects</p><p class="First">68/87 (78%)</p><p class="First">6/29 (21%)</p><p class="First">71/93 (76%)</p><p class="First">8/32 (25%)</p><p class="First">Subjects with Face Lesions</p><p class="First">57/71 (80%)</p><p class="First">2/21 (10%)</p><p class="First">57/67 (85%)</p><p class="First">7/19 (37%)</p><p class="First">Patients with Scalp Lesions</p><p class="First">11/16 (69%)</p><p class="First">4/8 (50%)</p><p class="First">14/26 (54%)</p><p class="First">1/13 (8%)</p><p class="First">Complete Responders</p><p class="First">Total No. Subjects</p><p class="First">60/87 (69%)</p><p class="First">4/29 (14%)</p><p class="First">59/93 (63%)</p><p class="First">4/32 (13%)</p><p class="First">Subjects with Face Lesions</p><p class="First">49/71 (69%)</p><p class="First">2/21 (10%)</p><p class="First">47/67 (70%)</p><p class="First">4/19 (21%)</p><p class="First">Subjects with Scalp Lesions</p><p class="First">11/16 (69%)</p><p class="First">2/8 (25%)</p><p class="First">12/26 (46%)</p><p class="First">0/13 (0%)</p><p>Because ALA-018 and ALA-019 had identical protocols, the combined results from the two trials are shown in the following tables.
