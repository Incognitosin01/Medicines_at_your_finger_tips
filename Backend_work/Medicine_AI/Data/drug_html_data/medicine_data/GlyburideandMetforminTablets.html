</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metforminassociated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4) </span> and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]. </span></p><p><span class="Bold">If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]. </span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Glyburide and Metformin Tablets</h2><p class="First">Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h2>Glyburide and Metformin Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><ul>
<li>Give glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets in divided doses, twice daily, with meals.</li>
<li>For patients not treated with either glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin hydrochloride (HCl), initiate treatment with another formulation of glyburide and metformin HCl at a starting dose of 1.25 mg glyburide and 250mg metformin HCl orally, once or twice daily with meals.</li>
<li>For patients not adequately controlled on either glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) or metformin HCl alone, the recommended starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets is 2.5 mg/500 mg or 5 mg/500 mg orally twice daily with meals.</li>
<li>For patients previously treated with a combination therapy of glyburide (or another sulfonylurea) and metformin HCl, the starting dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should not exceed the daily dose of glyburide (or equivalent dose of another sulfonylurea) and metformin HCl already being taken.</li>
<li> Increase the dose gradually on the basis of glycemic control and tolerability, up to a maximum to a maximum dose of 20 mg glyburide/2000 mg metformin HCl daily.</li>
</ul><h3>Patients Receiving Colesevelam</h3><ul>
<li>Administer glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam for patients taking both drugs concomitantly [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</li>

<li>Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma.</li>
<li>Concomitant administration of bosentan [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].  </li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Lactic Acidosis</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.</p><p>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. In glyburide and metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</p><p>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</p><p>For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:</p><ul>
<li><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span>—The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.</li>
</ul><p>The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]:</p><ul>
<li>Before initiating glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).</li>
<li>Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span> <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</li>
<li>Initiation of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>.</li>
<li>Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patient taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.</li>
<li>In patients taking glyburide and metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. </li>
<li><span class="Italics">Drug interactions</span>—The concomitant use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation [see  <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. </li>
<li><span class="Italics">Age 65 or Greater</span>—The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. </li>
<li><span class="Italics">Radiologic studies with contrast</span>—Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop glyburide and metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m <span class="Sup">2</span>; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure, or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Reevaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart glyburide and metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable. </li>
<li><span class="Italics">Surgery and other procedures</span>—Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. </li>
<li><span class="Italics">Hypoxic states</span>—Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. </li>
<li><span class="Italics">Excessive Alcohol intake</span>—Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. </li>
<li><span class="Italics">Hepatic impairment—</span>Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.</li>
</ul><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">All sulfonylurea drugs, including glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia [see <span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span>]. Concomitant use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride with other anti-diabetic medication can increase the risk of hypoglycemia. A lower dose of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when combining it with other anti-diabetic medications.</p><p>Educate patients to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. When initiating and increasing glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia (e.g., the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other anti-diabetic medications) start with a lower dose. Debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of anti-diabetic medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested.</p><p>The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia.</p><p>These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Mortality</h3><p class="First">The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups.</p><p>UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2½ times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of glyburide and of alternative modes of therapy.</p><p>Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.</p><h3>Hemolytic Anemia</h3><p class="First">Treatment of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents, including glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, can lead to hemolytic anemia. Avoid use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in patients with G6PD deficiency. In postmarketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.</p><h3>Vitamin B 12 Deficiency</h3><p class="First">In clinical studies of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> levels, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B <span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B <span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Lactic Acidosis [see <span class="Italics">Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>
<li>Hypoglycemia [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Cardiovascular mortality [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>]</li>
<li>Hemolytic anemia [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>]</li>
<li>Vitamin B <span class="Sub">12</span> Deficiency [ <span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span></span>]</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In double-blind clinical studies with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride as initial therapy or as second-line therapy of 20 and 14 weeks, respectively (see section 14), a total of 642 patients received glyburide and metformin hydrochloride, 312 received metformin HCl, 324 received glyburide, and 161 received placebo. Adverse reactions are listed in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>The incidence of reported symptoms of hypoglycemia (such as dizziness, shakiness, sweating, and hunger), in the initial therapy study of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride are summarized in Table 2. For patients with a baseline HbA1c between 8% and 11% treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 2.5 mg/500 mg as initial therapy, the frequency of hypoglycemic symptoms was 30% to 35%. As second-line therapy in patients inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea alone, approximately 6.8% of all patients treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride experienced hypoglycemic symptoms.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Reactions</span></p><p>The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain) in the glyburide and metformin hydrochloride initial therapy study are summarized in Table 2. Across all glyburide and metformin hydrochloride studies, GI symptoms were the most common adverse events with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and were more frequent at higher dose levels. In controlled studies, &lt;2% of patients discontinued glyburide and metformin hydrochloride therapy due to GI adverse events.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dermatologic Reactions</span></p><p>Allergic skin reactions, e.g., pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occur in 1.5% of glyburide-treated patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use.</p><h3>Postmarketing Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Allergic:</span> Angioedema, arthralgia, myalgia, and vasculitis have been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dermatologic:</span> Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic:</span> Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, which occasionally may present as purpura, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia, have been reported with sulfonylureas.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic:</span> Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin. Cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur rarely with glyburide, which may progress to liver failure. Liver function abnormalities, including isolated transaminase elevations, have been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic:</span> Hepatic porphyria reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas; however, these have not been reported with glyburide. Disulfiram-like reactions have been reported very rarely with glyburide. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with glyburide and all other sulfonylureas, most often in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Reactions:</span> Changes in accommodation and/or blurred vision have been reported with glyburide and other sulfonylureas. These are thought to be related to fluctuation in glucose levels.</p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Table 3 presents clinically significant drug interactions with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with</span> <span class="Bold">Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from a small number of published studies and postmarketing experience with glyburide use in pregnancy over decades have not identified any drug associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal outcomes. However, sulfonylureas (including glyburide) cross the placenta and have been associated with neonatal adverse reactions such as hypoglycemia. Therefore, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span>]. Limited data with metformin in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see <span class="Italics">Data</span>]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy [see <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span></span>].</p><p>No evidence of harm to the fetus was observed when doses up to 500 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg of glyburide, based on body surface area, were administered to rats and rabbits in reproduction studies.</p><p>No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 3- and 6- times, respectively, a 2000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see <span class="Italics">Data</span>].</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c &gt;7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a HbA1c &gt;10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Neonates of women with gestational diabetes who are treated with sulfonylureas during pregnancy may be at increased risk for neonatal intensive care admission and may develop respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, birth injury, and be large for gestational age. Prolonged severe hypoglycemia, lasting 4 to 10 days, has been reported in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery and has been reported with the use of agents with a prolonged half-life. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypoglycemia and respiratory distress and manage accordingly.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period</span></p><p>Due to reports of prolonged severe hypoglycemia in neonates born to mothers receiving a sulfonylurea at the time of delivery, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be discontinued at least two weeks before expected delivery [see <span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Published data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies were performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 500 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg of glyburide based on body surface area comparisons and revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus.</p><p>Metformin did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 3 and 6 times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Breastfed infants of lactating women using glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be monitored for symptoms of hypoglycemia [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span>]. Although glyburide was negligible in human milk in one small clinical lactation study; this result is not conclusive because of the limitations of the assay used in the study. There are no data on the effects of glyburide on milk production. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see <span class="Italics">Data</span>] <span class="Italics">.</span> However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from glyburide and metformin hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Monitoring for adverse reactions</span></p><p>Monitor breastfed infants for signs of hypoglycemia (e.g., jitters, cyanosis, apnea, hypothermia, excessive sleepiness, poor feeding, seizures).</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"> Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.     </p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride have not been established in pediatric patients.   </p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 642 patients who received glyburide and metformin hydrochloride in double-blind clinical studies, 23.8% were 65 and older while 2.8% were 75 and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of anti-diabetic agents. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in these patients.</p><p>In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis.

Mild hypoglycemic symptoms, without loss of consciousness or neurological findings, should be treated with oral glucose. Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment are medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment. The patient should be treated with glucagon or intravenous glucose. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Clearance of glyburide from plasma may be prolonged in persons with liver disease. Because of the extensive protein binding of glyburide, dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></p><p>Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 g. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]. Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.</p><h2>Glyburide and Metformin Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP for oral use contain glyburide USP and metformin hydrochloride USP.</p><p>Glyburide USP is a sulfonylurea and its chemical name is 1-[[p-[2-(5-chloro- <span class="Italics">o</span>-anisamido) ethyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-3-cyclo-hexylurea. Glyburide USP is a white to off-white crystalline compound with molecular formula of C <span class="Sub">23</span>H <span class="Sub">28</span>ClN <span class="Sub">3</span>O <span class="Sub">5</span>S and a molecular weight of 494.01.

The 1.25 mg/250 mg and 5 mg/500 mg strengths also contain D&amp;C Yellow#10 aluminum lake; The 2.5 mg/500 mg strength also contains FD&amp;C Red#40 aluminum lake.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span></p><p>Meets USP Dissolution Test 2</p><h2>Glyburide and Metformin Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Glyburide primarily lowers blood glucose by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor in the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, thereby stimulating the release of insulin.</p><p>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and daylong plasma insulin response may decrease.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p><p>In bioavailability studies of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 2.5 mg/500 mg and 5 mg/500 mg, the mean area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for the glyburide component was 18% and 7%, respectively, greater than that of standard particle-size glyburide coadministered with metformin. The pharmacokinetics of metformin HCl component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride was consistent with that of metformin HCl coadministered with glyburide.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of food:</span> Following administration of a single glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 5 mg/500 mg tablet with either a 20% glucose solution or a 20% glucose solution with food, there was no effect of food on the C <span class="Sub">max</span> and a relatively small effect of food on the AUC of the glyburide component. The T <span class="Sub">max</span> for the glyburide component was shortened from 7.5 hours to 2.75 hours with food compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting with a 20% glucose solution. The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the metformin component of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride was indeterminate. However, food is known to decrease the extent of and slightly delay the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C <span class="Sub">max</span>), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T <span class="Sub">max</span>) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.</p><p><span class="Italics">Glyburide</span></p><p>Single-dose studies with standard particle-size glyburide tablets in normal subjects demonstrate significant absorption of glyburide within 1 hour, peak drug levels at about 4 hours, and low but detectable levels at 24 hours. Mean serum levels of glyburide, as reflected by areas under the serum concentration-time curve, increase in proportion to corresponding increases in dose. Bioequivalence has not been established between glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and single-ingredient standard particle-size glyburide products.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></p><p>The absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets of 500 mg and 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &lt;1 mcg/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Glyburide</span></p><p>Sulfonylurea drugs are extensively bound to serum proteins. Displacement from protein binding sites by other drugs may lead to enhanced hypoglycemic action. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, the protein binding exhibited by glyburide is predominantly non-ionic, whereas that of other sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, tolazamide) is predominantly ionic. Acidic drugs, such as phenylbutazone, warfarin, and salicylates, displace the ionic-binding sulfonylureas from serum proteins to a far greater extent than the non-ionic binding glyburide. It has not been shown that this difference in protein binding results in fewer drug-drug interactions with glyburide tablets in clinical use.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of 850 mg averaged 654±358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Glyburide</span></p><p>The decrease of glyburide in the serum of normal healthy individuals is biphasic; the terminal half-life is about 10 hours. The major metabolite of glyburide is the 4-trans-hydroxy derivative.</p><p>A second metabolite, the 3-cis-hydroxy derivative, also occurs. These metabolites probably contribute no significant hypoglycemic action in humans since they are only weakly active (1/400 and 1/40 as active, respectively, as glyburide) in rabbits. Glyburide is excreted as metabolites in the bile and urine, approximately 50% by each route. This dual excretory pathway is qualitatively different from that of other sulfonylureas, which are excreted primarily in the urine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metformin</span></p><p>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance (see Table 4) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.</p><h3>Specific Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></p><p>No pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency for either glyburide or metformin [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (8.7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></span></p><p>No information is available on the pharmacokinetics of glyburide in patients with renal insufficiency.</p><p>In patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased (Table 4); [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2)</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span><span class="Italics">,</span> and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Geriatrics</span></span></p><p>There is no information on the pharmacokinetics of glyburide in elderly patients.</p><p>Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C <span class="Sub">max</span> is increased, when compared to healthy young subjects.
