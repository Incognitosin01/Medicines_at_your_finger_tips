Studies demonstrating clinical benefit such as prolongation of survival or relief of symptoms have not been performed. Studies providing a direct comparison of the clinical efficacy and safety of orally administered fludarabine phosphate relative to intravenously administered fludarabine phosphate have not been performed.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The oral dose is different than the intravenous dose.</span></p><p>The recommended adult dose of fludarabine phosphate is 40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> administered by mouth daily for five consecutive days. Each 5-day course of treatment should commence every 28 days. Dosage may be decreased or delayed based on evidence of hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity. Physicians should consider delaying or discontinuing the drug if neurotoxicity occurs. Fludarabine phosphate film-coated tablets can be taken either on an empty stomach or with food. The tablets have to be swallowed whole with water; they should not be chewed or broken.</p><p>The following table provides guidance for determining the number of tablets of fludarabine phosphate to be administered based on body surface area (BSA):</p><p>A number of clinical settings may predispose to increased toxicity from fludarabine phosphate. These include advanced age, renal insufficiency, and bone marrow impairment. Such patients should be monitored closely for excessive toxicity and the dose modified accordingly. The optimal duration of treatment has not been clearly established. It is recommended that three additional cycles of fludarabine phosphate be administered following the achievement of a maximal response and then the drug should be discontinued.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><ul class="Disc">

Dose levels approximately 4 times greater (96 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for 5 days to 7 days) than the recommended intravenous dose (25 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for 5 days) were associated with a syndrome characterized by delayed blindness, coma and death. Symptoms appeared from 21 days to 60 days following the last dose. Thirteen of 36 patients (36.1%) who received fludarabine phosphate intravenously at high doses (≥ 96 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for 5 days to 7 days per course) developed severe neurotoxicity, while only one of 443 patients (0.2%) who received the drug intravenously at low doses (≤ 40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day for 5 days per course) developed toxicity. In the pivotal clinical study conducted with fludarabine phosphate film-coated tablets administered at 40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, severe impairment of consciousness was reported in one patient. The effect of chronic administration of fludarabine phosphate on the central nervous system is unknown; however, patients have received the recommended dose for up to 15 courses of therapy. Physicians should consider delaying or discontinuing the drug if neurotoxicity occurs.</p><h3>Bone Marrow Suppression</h3><p class="First">Severe bone marrow suppression, notably anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, has been reported in patients treated with fludarabine phosphate. In a study in adult solid tumor patients, the median time to nadir counts was 13 days (range, 3 days to 25 days) for granulocytes and 16 days (range, 2 days to 32 days) for platelets. Most patients had hematologic impairment at baseline either as a result of disease or as a result of prior myelosuppressive therapy. Cumulative myelosuppression may be seen. While chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is often reversible, administration of fludarabine phosphate requires careful hematologic monitoring.</p><p>Several instances of trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia resulting in pancytopenia, sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in adult patients. The duration of clinically significant cytopenia in the reported cases has ranged from approximately 2 months to approximately 1 year. These episodes have occurred both in previously treated or untreated patients. One case of pancytopenia was reported in the pivotal clinical study conducted with oral fludarabine phosphate tablets.</p><p>Instances of life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia have been reported to occur after one or more cycles of treatment with fludarabine phosphate in patients with or without a previous history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia or a positive Coombs’ test and who may or may not be in remission from their disease. Steroids may or may not be effective in controlling these hemolytic episodes. The majority of patients rechallenged with fludarabine phosphate developed a recurrence in the hemolytic process. The mechanism(s) which predispose patients to the development of this complication has not been identified. Patients undergoing treatment with fludarabine phosphate should be evaluated and closely monitored for hemolysis.</p><h3>Pulmonary Toxicity</h3><p class="First">A high incidence of fatal pulmonary toxicity was observed in a clinical investigation using fludarabine phosphate in combination with pentostatin (deoxycoformycin) for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults. Therefore, the use of fludarabine phosphate in combination with pentostatin is not recommended.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Of 133 adult patients with CLL who received intravenous fludarabine phosphate in two clinical trials, there were 29 fatalities during study. Approximately 50% of the fatalities were due to infection and 25% due to progressive disease. Of 183 adult patients with CLL that received oral fludarabine phosphate in two clinical trials, there were 13 deaths. Approximately 50% of the deaths were due to progressive disease, while two patient deaths (15%) were attributed to infection. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection.</p><h3>Tumor Lysis Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Tumor lysis syndrome associated with fludarabine phosphate treatment has been reported in patients with CLL with large tumor burdens. Since fludarabine phosphate can induce a response as early as the first week of treatment, precautions should be taken in those patients at risk of developing this complication.</p><h3>Use of Transfusions</h3><p class="First">Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease has been observed rarely after transfusion of non-irradiated blood in fludarabine phosphate treated patients. Consideration should, therefore, be given to the use of irradiated blood products in those patients requiring transfusions while undergoing treatment with fludarabine phosphate.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Fludarabine phosphate must be administered cautiously in patients with renal impairment. Following dosing of the intravenous product, the total body clearance of 2-fluoro-ara-A has been shown to be directly correlated with creatinine clearance. Patients with mild to moderate impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) should have their oral fludarabine phosphate dose reduced by 20% and be monitored closely. Patients with severe impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) should have their oral fludarabine phosphate dose reduced by 50% and be monitored closely.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><ul class="Disc">

Fludarabine phosphate administered to rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformation, and decreased fetal body weights. If fludarabine phosphate is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. Women of childbearing potential and fertile males must take contraceptive measures during and at least for 6 months after the cessation of therapy.<br/>

Fludarabine phosphate tablets were studied primarily in Study 1 in 78 patients with CLL who received prior therapy and in Study 2 in 81 patients with CLL who had not received prior therapy.</p><p>Based on experience with the intravenous and oral use of fludarabine phosphate, the most common adverse reactions include myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia), fever and chills, infection, and nausea and vomiting. Other commonly reported events include malaise, fatigue, anorexia, and weakness. Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with CLL treated with fludarabine phosphate. The most frequently reported adverse reactions and those reactions which are more clearly related to the drug, as reported in clinical studies conducted with intravenous and oral fludarabine phosphate, are arranged below according to body system.</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Hematopoietic Systems</span></p><p>Hematologic events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and/or anemia) were reported in the majority of patients with CLL treated with fludarabine phosphate.

Myelosuppression may be severe, cumulative, and may affect multiple cell lines. Bone marrow fibrosis occurred in one CLL patient treated with fludarabine phosphate intravenously. In the pivotal oral fludarabine phosphate study (Study 1), there was one report of a non-fatal case of pancytopenia. Similarly, there was one case of non-fatal pancytopenia reported among the 133 patients with CLL treated with intravenous fludarabine phosphate.</p><p>Life-threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemias have been reported to occur in patients receiving fludarabine phosphate.

See <span class="Italics">‘</span><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span><span class="Italics">’</span> section.”</p><p>Based on its mechanism of action, fludarabine phosphate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of fludarabine phosphate in pregnant women. Fludarabine phosphate was embryolethal and teratogenic in both rats and rabbits. If fludarabine phosphate is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. Women of childbearing potential and fertile males must take contraceptive measures during and at least for 6 months after the cessation of therapy.</p><p>In rats, repeated intravenous doses of fludarabine phosphate at 1.5 times and 4.5 times the recommended human oral dose (40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) administered during organogenesis caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations (cleft palate, exencephaly, and fetal vertebrae deformities) and decreased fetal body weights. Maternal toxicity was not apparent at 1.5 times the human oral dose, and was limited to slight body weight decreases at 4.5 times the human oral dose. In rabbits, repeated intravenous doses of fludarabine phosphate at 2.4 times the human oral dose administered during organogenesis increased embryo and fetal lethality as indicated by increased resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses. A significant increase in malformations including cleft palate, hydrocephaly, adactyly, brachydactyly, fusions of the digits, diaphragmatic hernia, heart/great vessel defects, and vertebrae/rib anomalies were seen in all dose levels (≥ 0.3 times the human oral dose).</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether fludarabine phosphate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions including tumorgenicity in nursing infants, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of 78 previously treated patients with B-CLL treated with oral fludarabine phosphate 50% were ≥ age 65 and 3% were ≥ age 75. The response rate was generally lower among patients age 65 and older.  Among previously treated patients (Study 1) age 65 and older, the overall objective response, according to standardized response criteria developed by the National Cancer Institute CLL Working Group (NCI criteria), was 41%. The safety profile among younger and older patients on study was similar. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses or safety between older and younger patients.</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients receiving intravenous fludarabine phosphate, the total body clearance of the metabolite 2-fluoro-ara-adenine (2F-ara-A) correlated with the creatinine clearance, indicating the importance of the renal excretion pathway for the elimination of the drug. Renal clearance represented approximately 40% of the total body clearance. Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (30 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) receiving 20% reduced fludarabine phosphate dose had a similar exposure compared to patients with normal renal function receiving the recommended dose (AUC; 21 nM•h/mL versus 20 nM•h/mL). Two patients with severe renal impairment (&lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) receiving 40% reduced fludarabine phosphate dose had a 40% increase in exposure compared to patients with normal renal function receiving the recommended dose. The mean total body clearance was 172 mL/min for patients with normal renal function, 124 mL/min for patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function, and 71 mL/min for the two patients with severe renal impairment.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">High doses of fludarabine phosphate [<span class="Italics">See</span> <span class="Italics">Indications and Usage (1.1)</span> <span class="Italics">and</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>] have been associated with an irreversible central nervous system toxicity characterized by delayed blindness, coma and death. High doses are also associated with severe thrombocytopenia and neutropenia due to bone marrow suppression. There is no known specific antidote for fludarabine phosphate overdosage. Treatment consists of drug discontinuation and supportive therapy. In Study 2, two patients ingested an overdose of 20% to 33% of oral fludarabine phosphate. No serious side effects were reported.</p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">The chemical name for fludarabine phosphate is 9H-Purin-6-amine, 2-fluoro-9-(5-O-phosphono-ß-D-arabinofuranosyl)(2-fluoro-ara-AMP). The molecular formula of fludarabine phosphate is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">13</span>FN<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">7</span>P (MW 365.2) and the structure is provided in Figure 1</p><p>Fludarabine phosphate film-coated tablets for oral administration contain fludarabine phosphate, a fluorinated nucleotide analog of the antiviral agent vidarabine, 9-beta -D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A) that is relatively resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase. Each tablet contains 10 mg of the active ingredient fludarabine phosphate. The tablet core consists of microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate. The film-coat contains hypromellose, talc, titanium dioxide (E171) and ferric oxide pigment (red/E172, yellow/E172).</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Fludarabine phosphate (2F-ara-AMP) is a synthetic purine nucleotide antimetabolite agent. Upon administration, 2F-ara-AMP is rapidly dephosphorylated in the plasma to 2F-ara-A, which then enters into the cell. Intracellularly, 2F-ara-A is converted to the 5'-triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP (2F-ara-ATP). 2F-ara-ATP competes with deoxyadenosine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA. Once incorporated into DNA, 2F-ara-ATP functions as a DNA chain terminator, inhibits DNA polymerase alpha, gamma, and delta, and inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. 2F-ara-A also inhibits DNA primase and DNA ligase I. The mechanism of action of this antimetabolite is not completely characterized and may be multi-faceted.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Cardiac Electrophysiology</p><p>In a randomized, uncontrolled, open-label, parallel study, patients with B-cell CLL were administered a single dose of oral fludarabine phosphate 40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (n = 42) or intravenous fludarabine phosphate 25 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (n=14). The maximum increase in the baseline-corrected mean change in QTcI (individual-corrected QT interval) following treatment with oral fludarabine phosphate was less than 10 milliseconds.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Studies with the intravenous product have demonstrated that fludarabine phosphate is converted to the active metabolite, 2F-ara-A. Clinical pharmacology studies have focused on 2F-ara-A pharmacokinetics.</p><p>Following administration of the intravenous product, systemic plasma clearance of 2F-ara-A is approximately 117 mL/min to 145 mL/min. After five daily 30 minute intravenous infusions of 25 mg 2F-ara- AMP/m<span class="Sup">2</span> to cancer patients, trough concentrations of 2F-ara-A increased by a factor of about 2. The terminal half-life of 2F-ara-A was approximately 20 hours. Plasma protein binding of 2F-ara-A was approximately 19% to 29%. A correlation was noted between the degree of absolute granulocyte count nadir and increased area under the concentration x time curve (AUC).</p><p>2F-ara-A exhibits dose proportional increases in AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> after single oral doses of 50 mg, 70 mg or 90 mg of 2F-ara-AMP. C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 2F-ara-A occurs 1 hour to 2 hours after single or multiple oral doses and is approximately 20 % to 30 % of the maximum plasma concentrations produced at the end of a 30 minute intravenous infusion of the same dose. The absolute oral bioavailability of 2F-ara-A is 50 - 65% following single and repeated doses of the immediate release tablet formulation. Similar systemic exposure (AUC) was observed after a single 40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> fludarabine phosphate oral dose and a single 25 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> fludarabine phosphate intravenous dose. The terminal half-life of 2F-ara-A was similar to that following intravenous administration; approximately 20 hours. The C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC and terminal half-life of 2F-ara-A are unaffected when administered with a high fat meal, although T<span class="Sub">max</span> is slightly delayed from 1.3 hours to 2.2 hours.</p><p>Following intravenous administration, renal clearance of 2F-ara-A represents approximately 40% of the total body clearance of fludarabine phosphate, and total body clearance is inversely correlated with serum creatinine and creatinine clearance. In two patients with median creatinine clearance of 22 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>, 2F-ara-A clearance was reduced by 56%.

[<span class="Italics">See</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>]</p><h2>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No animal carcinogenicity studies with fludarabine phosphate have been conducted.</p><p>Fludarabine phosphate is a clastogen.</p><p>Fludarabine phosphate was clastogenic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to Chinese hamster ovary cells (chromosome aberration assay) in the presence of metabolic activation and induced sister chromatid exchanges both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. In addition, fludarabine phosphate was clastogenic <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (mouse micronucleus assay) but was not mutagenic to germ cells (dominant lethal test in male mice). Fludarabine phosphate was not mutagenic to bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian cells either in the presence or absence of metabolic activation.</p><p>Studies in mice, rats and dogs have demonstrated dose-related adverse effects on the male reproductive system. Observations consisted of a decrease in mean testicular weights in mice and rats with a trend toward decreased testicular weights in dogs and degeneration and necrosis of spermatogenic epithelium of the testes in mice, rats and dogs.</p><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">Study 1, a single-arm, open-label study of fludarabine phosphate film-coated tablets was conducted in 78 adult patients with CLL refractory to at least one prior standard alkylating-agent containing regimen. In this multicenter study patients were treated with oral fludarabine phosphate at a dose of 40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily for 5 days every 28 days. The patient population median age was 64.5 years and consisted of 72% males and 28% females. Ninety-nine percent of the patients were Caucasian. The Rai stage for patients entering the study was: Stage 0 (3.9%), Stage I (20.5%), Stage II (32.1%), Stage III (11.5%), and Stage IV (32.1%). The mean number of treatment cycles was 5.1 with a mean daily dose of fludarabine phosphate of 38 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The overall objective response, according to standardized response criteria developed by the National Cancer Institute CLL Working Group (NCI criteria), was 51 %, including 18% complete responses and 33% partial responses. The overall response rate, according to standardized criteria developed by the International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL criteria), was 46%, including 21% complete responses and 26% partial responses. Data on duration of response was not collected.</p><p>In Study 2, a supportive single-arm, open-label study, fludarabine phosphate tablets were administered to 81 previously untreated patients with B-CLL. In this multicenter study each patient was treated with oral fludarabine phosphate at a dose of 40 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> daily for 5 days every 28 days. The patient population median age was 64.0 years and consisted of 63% males and 37% females. Ninety-nine percent of the patients were Caucasian. The Rai stage for patients entering the study was: Stage 0 (3.7%), Stage I (37.0%), Stage II (37.0%), Stage III (9.9%), and Stage IV (12.3%). The mean number of treatment cycles was 5.9 with a mean daily dose per patient of 71 mg to 74 mg. The overall responses rate, according to NCI criteria, was 80%, including 12% complete responses and 68% partial responses. The overall response rate, according to IWCLL criteria, was 72%, including 37% complete responses and 35% partial responses. The median duration of response was 22.9 months.</p><p>Study 3 was a supportive randomized controlled open label study in patients with previously untreated B-CLL that included fludarabine phosphate monotherapy and fludarabine phosphate combination therapy arms. In this study 107 evaluable patients received fludarabine phosphate 40mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> orally daily for 5 days every 28 days. The overall response rate according to modified NCI criteria was 74% and the CR plus nodular PR rate was 41%.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">Preventing Occupational Exposures to Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Health Care Settings.
