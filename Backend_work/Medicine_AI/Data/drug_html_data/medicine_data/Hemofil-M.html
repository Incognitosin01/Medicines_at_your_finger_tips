</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antihemophilic Agent</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Hemofil-M</h2><p>Antihemophilic factor (AHF) injection is used to treat and control serious bleeding episodes in patients with a bleeding problem called hemophilia A (congenital Factor VIII deficiency). The bleeding episode may be related to an injury (trauma) or a surgical procedure. It is also used to reduce the number of bleeding episodes in patients when used regularly. AHF injection is also used to prevent bleeding during a surgical procedure.</p><p>Antihemophilic factor (AHF) is a protein that is produced naturally in the body. It helps the blood form clots to stop bleeding and prevents bleeding problems from happening as often.</p><p>Hemophilia A, also called classical hemophilia, is a condition where the body does not make enough AHF. If you do not have enough AHF and you become injured, your blood will not form clots properly. You might bleed into and damage your muscles and joints. AHF injection is given to increase the levels of AHF in the blood.</p><p>There are several different types of AHF. They are made from human blood or artificially by a man-made process (recombinant). AHF made from human blood has been treated and is not likely to contain harmful viruses, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The man-made AHF products do not contain these viruses.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Hemofil-M</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of antihemophilic factor injection in children.</p><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Hemofil® M</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Advate®</i>, <i>Adynovate®</i>, <i>Eloctate™</i>, <i>Kogenate® FS</i>, <i>Kovaltry®</i>, <i>Novoeight®</i>, <i>Xyntha®</i>, and <i>Xyntha® Solofuse®</i> have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related medical problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving <i>Advate®</i>, <i>Adynovate®</i>, <i>Eloctate™</i>, <i>Kogenate® FS</i>, <i>Kovaltry®</i>, <i>Novoeight®</i>, and <i>Xyntha®</i>.</p><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of antihemophilic factor injection in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine.

It may not be specific to Hemofil-M. Please read with care.</b></p><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child this medicine in a hospital or clinic setting. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.</p><p>This medicine may also be given at home to patients who do not need to be in a hospital or clinic. If you or your child is using this medicine at home, your doctor will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. <i>Make sure you understand all of the instructions before giving yourself an injection</i>. Your dose may change based on where you are bleeding. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Use only the brand of this medicine that your doctor prescribed. Not all brands are prepared in the same way and the dose may be different.</p><p>Every package of medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p><i>To prepare the medicine using 2 bottles (vials) or containers</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take the bottles of powder medicine and liquid (diluent) out of the refrigerator and warm them to room temperature.</li>
<li>Wipe the rubber surface of the bottles with an alcohol swab and allow them to dry.</li>
<li>Follow the specific directions for your brand of medicine when you prepare the injection.</li>
<li>Add the liquid to the powder using the special transfer needle or transfer device that comes with the package.</li>
<li>When injecting the liquid into the dry medicine, aim the stream of liquid against the wall of the container of dry medicine to prevent foaming.</li>
<li>Swirl the bottle gently to dissolve the medicine. Do not shake the bottle. Shaking will create foam in the mixture.</li>
<li>Check the mixture to make sure it is clear. Do not use the medicine if you can see anything solid in the mixture or if the mixture is cloudy.</li>
<li>Use a plastic disposable syringe to remove the mixture from the bottle. Use a special filter needle if your brand of medicine provides one.</li>
<li>Give the injection as directed by your doctor.</li>
<li>If you are using more than one bottle of medicine for your dose, prepare the second bottle the same way. Add the mixture from the second bottle to the same syringe.</li>
</ul><p><i>To prepare the medicine using a prefilled dual-chamber syringe (Xyntha® and Xyntha® Solofuse®)</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take the prefilled dual-chamber syringe out of the refrigerator and warm it to room temperature.</li>
<li>The dual-chamber syringe has the powder medicine in one part and the liquid (diluent) in the second part of the syringe.</li>
<li>Attach the plunger rod to the syringe according to the directions. Keep the syringe pointed up to prevent leaking of the liquid.</li>
<li>Remove the white seal and the grey rubber tip cap. Put the blue vented cap on the syringe. Do not touch the open ends of the syringe and the blue cap.</li>
<li>Slowly push the plunger until the 2 stoppers inside the syringe are together. This will push all of the liquid into the chamber with the powder medicine.</li>
<li>Keep the syringe pointed up and gently swirl the syringe to mix the liquid and powder.</li>
<li>Check the mixture to make sure it is clear. Do not use the medicine if you can see anything solid in the mixture or if the mixture is cloudy.</li>
<li>Keep the syringe pointed up and push the plunger until most of the air is removed.</li>
<li>A special infusion set comes with the package. Remove the blue cap and attach the infusion set to the syringe.</li>
<li>Give the injection as directed by your doctor.</li>
<li>If you are using more than one syringe of medicine for your dose, prepare the second dual-chamber syringe the same way. The mixture from each syringe will be combined together in a separate syringe before your injection. Your doctor will show you how to do this.</li>
</ul><p><i>Use the mixture within 3 or 4 hours after it is prepared</i>. It must not be stored and used later. Do not put the mixture in the refrigerator.</p><p>Do not reuse syringes and needles.
