Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well.</p><p>Fluticasone and vilanterol is a powder that comes with a special inhaler device preloaded with blister packs containing measured doses of the medicine. The device opens and loads a blister of fluticasone and vilanterol each time you use the inhaler. Follow the patient instructions provided with the inhaler device.</p><p>Use the medicine at the same time each day, and not more than once in a 24-hour period.</p><p>Your dose needs may change due to surgery, illness, stress, or a recent asthma attack. Do not change your medication dose or schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p>Always rinse out your mouth with water after using the inhaler device, to help prevent thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth or throat).</p><p>Your doctor will need to check your lung function on a regular basis. Your vision and your bone mineral density may also need to be checked.</p><p>Once your asthma is under control, your doctor may want you to stop using this medicine. Keep all follow-up appointments and do not stop using the medicine unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light. Keep the inhaler device in the sealed foil tray until ready to start using it.</p><p>Throw the inhaler device away 6 weeks after you have taken it out of the foil pouch, or if the dose indicator shows a zero, whichever comes first.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose.
