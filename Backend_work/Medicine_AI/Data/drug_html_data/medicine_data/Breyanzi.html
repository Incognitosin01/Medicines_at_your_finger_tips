Breyanzi is a medicine made from your own white blood cells; the cells are genetically modified to recognize and attack your lymphoma cells.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Breyanzi may cause side effects that are life-threatening and can lead to death.<br/>

<li>severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</li>
<li>fast or irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>dizziness/lightheadedness</li>

</ul><p>It is important that you tell your healthcare providers that you have received Breyanzi and to show them your Patient Wallet Card. Your healthcare provider may give you other medicines to treat your side effects.</p><h2>How will I receive Breyanzi?</h2><ul>
<li>Breyanzi is made from your own white blood cells, so your blood will be collected by a process called "leukapheresis".</li>
<li>It takes about 3-4 weeks from the time your cells are received at the manufacturing site and are available to be shipped back to your healthcare provider, but the time may vary.</li>
<li>Before you get Breyanzi, you will get 3 days of chemotherapy to prepare your body.</li>
<li>When your Breyanzi is ready, your healthcare provider will give it to you through a catheter (tube) placed into your vein (intravenous infusion). Breyanzi is given as infusions of 2 different cell types.
<ul>
<li>You will receive infusions of one cell type, immediately followed by the other cell type.</li>
<li>The time for infusion will vary, but will usually be less than 15 minutes for each of the 2 cell types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During the first week, you will be monitored daily by the facility where you received your treatment.</li>
<li>You should plan to stay close to this location for at least 4 weeks after getting Breyanzi. Your healthcare provider will check to see that your treatment is working and help you with any side effects that may occur.</li>
<li>You may be hospitalized for side effects and your healthcare provider will discharge you if your side effects are under control, and it is safe for you to leave the hospital.</li>
<li>Your healthcare provider will want to do blood tests to follow your progress. It is important that you do have your blood tested. If you miss an appointment, call your healthcare provider as soon as possible to reschedule.</li>
