</ul><h2>Diclofenac Delayed Release Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, USP are a benzene-acetic acid derivative. Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are available as enteric-coated tablets of 50 mg (light brown) or 75 mg (light pink) for oral administration. Diclofenac sodium, USP is a faintly yellowish white to light beige crystalline powder and is sparingly soluble in water at 25°C. The chemical name is Sodium [ <span class="Italics">o</span>-(2,6-dichloroanilino)phenyl]acetate. The molecular weight is 318.13. Its molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">14</span>H <span class="Sub">10</span>Cl <span class="Sub">2</span>NNaO <span class="Sub">2</span> and it has the following structural formula:</p><p>The inactive ingredients in diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets include: crospovidone, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, simethicone, sodium hydroxide, talc and titanium dioxide. The 50 mg tablets also contain FD&amp;C Blue No. 2 Aluminum Lake and yellow iron oxide. The 75 mg tablets also contain FD&amp;C Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake.</p><p>The imprinting ink contains the following inactive ingredients: ammonium hydroxide, black iron oxide, propylene glycol and shellac glaze.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac is 100% absorbed after oral administration compared to IV administration as measured by urine recovery. However, due to first-pass metabolism, only about 50% of the absorbed dose is systemically available (see Table 1). Food has no significant effect on the extent of diclofenac absorption. However, there is usually a delay in the onset of absorption of 1 to 4.5 hours and a reduction in peak plasma levels of &lt; 20%.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PK Parameter</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Normal Healthy Adults</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(20 to 48 years)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Coefficient of Mean</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Variation (%)</span></p><p class="First">Absolute</p><p>Bioavailability (%)</p><p>[N = 7]</p><p class="First">55</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First">T <span class="Sub">max</span> (hr)</p><p>[N = 56 ]</p><p class="First">2.3</p><p class="First">69</p><p class="First">Oral Clearance</p><p>(CL/F; mL/min) [N = 56]</p><p class="First">582</p><p class="First">23</p><p class="First">Renal Clearance</p><p>(% unchanged drug in</p><p>urine) [N = 7]</p><p class="First">&lt; 1</p><p class="First">—</p><p class="First">Apparent Volume of</p><p>Distribution (V/F; L/kg)</p><p>[N = 56]</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">58</p><p class="First">Terminal Half-life (hr)</p><p>[N = 56]</p><p class="First">2.3</p><p class="First">48</p><p class="First">The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of diclofenac sodium is 1.4 L/kg.</p><p>Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15 to 105 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.</p><p>Diclofenac diffuses into and out of the synovial fluid. Diffusion into the joint occurs when plasma levels are higher than those in the synovial fluid, after which the process reverses and synovial fluid levels are higher than plasma levels. It is not known whether diffusion into the joint plays a role in the effectiveness of diclofenac.</p><p class="First">Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4’-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3’-hydroxy-, 4’, 5-dihydroxy-and 3’-hydroxy-4’- methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4’-hydroxy- diclofenac is primarily mediated by CYP2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CYP2C9 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy- and 3’-hydroxy-diclofenac. In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4’-hydroxy- and 5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects.</p><p class="First">Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 2 hours.</p><h3>Special Populations</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets has not been investigated in pediatric patients.</p><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.</p><p class="First">Hepatic metabolism accounts for almost 100% of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets elimination, so patients with hepatic disease may require reduced doses of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets compared to patients with normal hepatic function.</p><p class="First">Diclofenac pharmacokinetics has been investigated in subjects with renal insufficiency. No differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac have been detected in studies of patients with renal impairment. In patients with renal impairment (inulin clearance 60 to 90, 30 to 60, and &lt; 30 mL/min; N = 6 in each group), AUC values and elimination rate were comparable to those in healthy subjects.</p><p class="First">When co-administered with voriconazole (inhibitor of CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4 enzyme), the C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of diclofenac increased by 114% and 78%, respectively (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p><p class="First">When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation).</p><p>Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated:</p><ul>
<li>For relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis</li>
<li>For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis</li>
<li>For acute or long-term use in the relief of signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis</li>
</ul><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul>
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to diclofenac or any components of the drug product (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactic Reactions, Serious Skin Reactions).</li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see <span class="Italics">WARNINGS: Anaphylactic Reaction</span>, Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity).</li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see <span class="Italics">WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</span>).</li>
</ul><h2>WARNINGS</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation).</p><p class="First">Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p><p class="First">Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p><p class="First">Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who use NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs);, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><ul>
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).</p><p>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</p><p>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</p><p>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.</p><p>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p><p>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, anti-epileptics).</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazides diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately 2-fold increase in hospitalization for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p><p>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First">Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p class="First">Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to diclofenac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS: Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity).</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). When diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy).</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids and the patient should be observed closely for any evidence of adverse effects, including adrenal insufficiency and exacerbation of symptoms of arthritis.</p><p>The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) that accompanies each prescription dispensed. Inform patients, families, or their caregivers of the following information before initiating therapy with diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.</p><p class="First">Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events).</p><p class="First">Advise patients to report symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis to their health care provider. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, inform patients of the increased risk for the signs and symptoms of GI bleeding (see WARNING: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation).</p><p class="First">Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, diarrhea, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). If these occur, instruct patients to stop diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and seek immediate medical therapy (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity).</p><p class="First">Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS: Heart Failure and Edema).</p><p class="First">Inform patients of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). Instruct patients to seek immediate emergency help if these occur (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactic Reactions).</p><p class="First">Advise patients to stop diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS: Serious Skin Reactions).</p><p class="First">Advise females of reproductive potential who desire pregnancy that NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, may be associated with a reversible delay in ovulation (see PRECAUTIONS: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility).</p><p class="First">Inform pregnant women to avoid use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and other NSAIDs, starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see WARNINGS: Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus).</p><p class="First">Inform patients that the concomitant use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) is not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, and little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation and Drug Interactions). Alert patients that NSAIDs may be present in “over the counter” medications for treatment of colds, fever, or insomnia.</p><p class="First">Inform patients not to use low-dose aspirin concomitantly with diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets until they talk to their healthcare provider (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically (see WARNINGS: Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation, and Hepatotoxicity).</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clinical Impact:</span></p><ul>

A 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in mice employing diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.007 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.02 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in females did not reveal any oncogenic potential.</p><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium did not show mutagenic activity in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> point mutation assays in mammalian (mouse lymphoma) and microbial (yeast, Ames) test systems and was nonmutagenic in several mammalian <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> tests, including dominant lethal and male germinal epithelial chromosomal studies in mice, and nucleus anomaly and chromosomal aberration studies in Chinese hamsters.</p><p class="First">Diclofenac sodium administered to male and female rats at 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) did not affect fertility.</p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) (see WARNINGS: Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arterious).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2% to 4% for major malformations, and 15% to 20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, or rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 0.5, 0.5, and 1 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, 200 mg/day, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses [see Data]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</p><p class="First">Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, 200 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 and 1 times, respectively, the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In a study in which pregnant rats were orally administered 2 or 4 mg/kg diclofenac (0.1 and 0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA) from Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21, significant maternal toxicity (peritonitis, mortality) was noted. These maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice, rats, and humans.</p><h3>Labor or Delivery</h3><p class="First">There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Based on available data, diclofenac may be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First">One woman treated orally with a diclofenac salt, 150 mg/day, had a milk diclofenac level of 100 mcg/L, equivalent to an infant dose of about 0.03 mg/kg/day. Diclofenac was not detectable in breast milk in 12 women using diclofenac (after either 100 mg/day orally for 7 days or a single 50 mg intramuscular dose administered in the immediate postpartum period).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects (see WARNINGS: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events, Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation, Hepatotoxicity, Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Monitoring).</p><p>Diclofenac is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, ADVERSE REACTIONS).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>
