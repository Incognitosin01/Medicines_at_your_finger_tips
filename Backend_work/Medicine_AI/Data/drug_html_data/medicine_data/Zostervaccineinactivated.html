When this virus becomes active again, it can cause herpes zoster, or shingles. Inactivated zoster vaccine helps prevent shingles.</p><p>This vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of inactive virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Inactivated zoster vaccine is used to prevent herpes zoster virus (shingles) in people age 50 and older, including people who previously received a live zoster vaccine (Zostavax).</p><p>Inactivated zoster vaccine will not treat chickenpox, shingles, or nerve pain caused by shingles (post-herpetic neuralgia).</p><p>Inactivated zoster vaccine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive the second shot if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to inactivated zoster virus vaccine.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to any vaccine.</p><p>It is not known whether zoster vaccine will harm an unborn baby.

A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>This vaccine is usually given in a series of 2 shots. The second shot may be given any time within 2 to 6 months after the first shot.</p><p>You may receive this vaccine at the same time that you get a flu shot.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor if you miss the second dose or if you get behind schedule.
