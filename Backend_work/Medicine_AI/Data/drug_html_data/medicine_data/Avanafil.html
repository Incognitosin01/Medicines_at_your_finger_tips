This has occurred in a small number of people taking sildenafil (Viagra) or other drugs similar to avanafil. Most of these people also had heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or certain pre-existing eye problems, and in those who smoked or were over 50 years old. It is not clear whether avanafil is the actual cause of vision loss.</p><p><b>Avanafil is for use only in men.</b> It is not known whether  avanafil would be harmful if used by a woman during pregnancy or while breast-feeding.</p><h2>How should I take avanafil?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Avanafil can be taken with or without food.</p><p>Avanafil is usually taken only when needed, about 15 to 30 minutes before sexual activity. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Avanafil can help achieve an erection when sexual stimulation occurs. An erection will not occur just by taking a pill.</p><p><b>Do not take avanafil more than once a day.</b> Allow 24 hours to pass between doses.</p><p>Call your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if your erection is painful or lasts longer than 4 hours. A prolonged erection (priapism) can damage the penis.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since avanafil is used as needed, you are not likely to be on a dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking avanafil?</h2><p>Drinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of avanafil.
