Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing oxycodone ER, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions.Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to: complete a REMS-compliant education program, counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacists, and consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety.Life-Threatening Respiratory DepressionSerious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of oxycodone ER. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of oxycodone ER or following a dose increase.Accidental IngestionAccidental ingestion of even one dose of oxycodone ER, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone ER.Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal SyndromeProlonged use of oxycodone ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.Cytochrome P450 3A4 InteractionThe concomitant use of oxycodone ER with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving oxycodone ER and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer.Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS DepressantsReserve concomitant prescribing of oxycodone ER and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation .</p><p>Addiction, abuse, and misuse, leading to overdose and death has been reported. Before prescribing, assess the patient's risk and watch for signs of the development of these behaviors. To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Serious and fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially when beginning treatment or increasing dose. Advise patients to swallow tablets whole to avoid overdose. Accidental ingestion can result in a fatal overdose, especially in children. Prolonged use in pregnancy may lead to life-threatening neonatal withdrawal syndrome. If oxycodone hydrochloride must be used during pregnancy, advise the patient of the risk and ensure that treatment will be available to the infant. Initiation of CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers can cause a fatal oxycodone hydrochloride overdose. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for patients with inadequate alternative treatment options. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation .</p><p>Use caution when prescribing and administering oxycodone oral solution as dosing errors due to mg and mL could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is indicated and dispensed. Oxycodone oral solution should be kept out of the reach of children. Seek emergency help immediately if accidental ingestion occurs .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Analgesic</p><p>Chemical Class: Opioid</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Roxybond</h2><p>Oxycodone is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. It belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). Oxycodone acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.</p><p>Oxycodone <i>extended-release capsules or tablets</i> should not be used if you need pain medicine for just a short time, such as when recovering from surgery. Do not use this medicine to relieve mild pain, or in situations when non-narcotic medication is effective. This medicine should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed".</p><p>When oxycodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.</p><p>This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Roxybond</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Oxaydo®</i>, <i>Roxicodone®</i>, <i>Roxybond™</i>, and <i>Xtampza® ER</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Oxycontin®</i> in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 11 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of oxycodone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving oxycodone in order to avoid potentially serious side effects.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
<li>Nalmefene</li>
<li>Naltrexone</li>
<li>Safinamide</li>
</ul><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

It may not be specific to Roxybond. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. This is especially important for elderly patients, who may be more sensitive to the effects of pain medicines. If too much of this medicine is taken for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence).</p><p>It is very important that you understand the rules of the Opioid Analgesic REMS program to prevent addiction, abuse, and misuse of oxycodone. This medicine should also come with a Medication Guide and a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Oxycodone <i>extended-release capsules or tablets</i> should only be used by patients who have already been taking narcotic pain medicines, also called opioids. These patients are called <i>opioid-tolerant</i>. If you are uncertain whether or not you are opioid-tolerant, check with your doctor before using this medicine.</p><p>Measure the <i>oral liquid concentrate</i> with the calibrated dropper that comes with the package. Your doctor may have you mix the concentrate with a small amount of liquid or food. Carefully follow the instructions and take the medicine mixture right away.</p><p>Measure the <i>oral liquid</i> with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.</p><p>Swallow the <i>Oxaydo®</i> or <i>OxyContin® tablet</i> whole with water. Do not break, crush, cut, chew, or dissolve it. Do not pre-soak, lick, or wet the tablet before placing it in the mouth. Take one tablet at a time. Also, do not give this medicine through nasogastric or feeding tubes.</p><p>If you are using the extended-release capsules:</p><ul>
<li>Take this medicine with food and with about the same amount of food each time.</li>
<li>If you have trouble swallowing, you may open the capsule and sprinkle the contents on soft foods (eg, applesauce, pudding, yogurt, ice cream, or jam) or into a cup and swallow immediately. Drink a glass of water to make sure all the medicine has been taken.</li>
<li>This medicine may also be given through a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube.</li>
</ul><p>Oxycodone <i>extended-release capsules or tablets</i> work differently from the regular oxycodone oral solution or tablets, even at the same dose. Do not switch from one brand or form to the other unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>While taking the <i>Roxybond™ tablet</i>, part of it may pass into your stool. This is normal and nothing to worry about.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
