Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Meropenem is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>Meropenem must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not mix other injectable medications in the same IV bag or tubing with meropenem. Do not use if the medicine has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve. Skipping doses can increase your risk of infection that is resistant to medication. Meropenem will not treat a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold.</p><p>If you use meropenem long-term, you may need frequent medical tests.</p><p>Store unopened vials at cool room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>After mixing your medicine, you must use it within a certain number of hours. This will depend on the diluent and how you store the mixture (at cool room temperature, or in a refrigerator). Carefully follow the mixing and storage instructions provided with your medicine. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
