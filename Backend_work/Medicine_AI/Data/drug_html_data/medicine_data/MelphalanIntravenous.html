Melphalan belongs to the group of medicines called alkylating agents (cancer medicines). It works by interfering with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by melphalan, other unwanted effects will also occur. Before you begin treatment with melphalan, talk to your doctor about the benefits as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>Melphalan is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using melphalan</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For melphalan, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to melphalan or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of melphalan injection in the pediatric population.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of melphalan</h2><p>You will receive melphalan in a hospital or cancer treatment center. A nurse or other trained health professional will give you melphalan. Melphalan is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.</p><p>Melphalan should come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using melphalan</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure melphalan is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using melphalan while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control during and after treatment to keep from getting pregnant. Men should also use effective contraception to prevent pregnancy in a sexual partner during and after treatment. If you think a pregnancy has occurred with melphalan, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Melphalan may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hives, hoarseness, lightheadedness or fainting, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are receiving melphalan.</p><p>Melphalan can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>While you are being treated with melphalan, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. Melphalan may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.</p><p>Melphalan can cause diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or sores or ulcers in the mouth, sometimes even after you receive medicine to prevent these effects. Ask your doctor or nurse about ways to control these symptoms.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>Using melphalan may increase your risk of getting other types of cancer. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about this risk.</p><p>Some men and women using melphalan have become infertile (unable to have children). Melphalan might make a woman stop having menstrual periods temporarily. Talk with your doctor if this is a concern.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Melphalan side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
