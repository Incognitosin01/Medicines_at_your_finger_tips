Atripla is not a cure for HIV or AIDS. Atripla is for use in adults and children who are at least 12 years old and weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kilograms).</p><p>Atripla may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not take Atripla together with adefovir, atazanavir, voriconazole, or medications that contain emtricitabine, lamivudine, or tenofovir.</p><p>Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using. Many drugs can interact, and some drugs should not be used together.</p><p><b>Atripla can cause severe or fatal liver problems.</b> Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms such as stomach pain or swelling, loss of appetite, dark urine, or yellowing of your skin or eyes.</p><p>You may develop <b>lactic acidosis,</b> a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if you have unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, stomach pain, dizziness, feeling cold, or feeling very weak or tired.</p><p>If you've ever had hepatitis B, it may become active or get worse after you stop using Atripla. You may need frequent liver function tests for several months.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take  efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir if you are allergic to efavirenz (Sustiva), emtricitabine (Emtriva), or tenofovir (Viread).</p><p>Do not take Atripla together with adefovir, atazanavir, voriconazole, or any medications that contain emtricitabine, lamivudine, or tenofovir (such as Combivir, Complera, Descovy, Epivir, Epzicom, Genvoya, Odefsey, Stribild, Trizivir, Truvada, Vemlidy).</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Ask your doctor about your risk.</p><p><b>Atripla can cause birth defects. Do not use if you are pregnant, and do not get pregnant for at least 12 weeks after you stop taking Atripla.</b></p><p>Atripla can make hormonal birth control less effective (birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, vaginal rings). Use two barrier forms of birth control (condom or diaphragm with spermicide) to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast-feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2>How should I take Atripla?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Take this medicine <b>on an empty stomach</b> with a full glass of water.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests.</p><p>This medicine may affect a drug-screening urine test and you may have false results. Tell the laboratory staff that you use Atripla.</p><p>Store Atripla in the original container at room temperature, away from moisture, heat, and light. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><p>If you've ever had hepatitis B, this virus may become active or get worse in the months after you stop using Atripla. You may need frequent liver function tests while using this medicine and for several months after your last dose.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
