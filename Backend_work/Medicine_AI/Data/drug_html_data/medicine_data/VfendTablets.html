</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Vfend Tablets</h2><h3>Invasive Aspergillosis</h3><p class="First">VFEND is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) for the treatment of invasive apergillosis (IA). In clinical trials, the majority of isolates recovered were <span class="Italics">Aspergillus fumigatus</span>. There was a small number of cases of culture-proven disease due to species of <span class="Italics">Aspergillus</span> other than <span class="Italics">A. fumigatus</span> <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.5) and Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Candidemia in Non-neutropenic Patients and Other Deep Tissue Candida Infections</h3><p class="First">VFEND is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) for the treatment of candidemia in non-neutropenic patients and the following <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections: disseminated infections in skin and infections in abdomen, kidney, bladder wall, and wounds <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.5) and Microbiology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Esophageal Candidiasis</h3><p class="First">VFEND is indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis (EC) in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.5) and Microbiology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Scedosporiosis and Fusariosis</h3><p class="First">VFEND is indicated for the treatment of serious fungal infections caused by <span class="Italics">Scedosporium apiospermum</span> (asexual form of <span class="Italics">Pseudallescheria boydii</span>) and <span class="Italics">Fusarium spp.</span> including <span class="Italics">Fusarium solani</span>, in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) intolerant of, or refractory to, other therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4) and Microbiology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (including histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organism(s). Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known. However, once these results become available, antifungal therapy should be adjusted accordingly.</p><h2>Vfend Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions for Use in All Patients</h3><p class="First">Administer Vfend Tablets or Oral Suspension at least one hour before or after a meal.</p><p>VFEND I.V. for Injection requires reconstitution to 10 mg/mL and subsequent dilution to 5 mg/mL or less prior to administration as an infusion, at a maximum rate of 3 mg/kg per hour over 1 to 2 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administer diluted VFEND I.V. by intravenous infusion over 1 to 2 hours only. Do not administer as an IV bolus injection.</span></p><h3>Use of VFEND I.V. With Other Parenteral Drug Products</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Blood products and concentrated electrolytes</span></p><p><span class="Bold">VFEND I.V. must not be infused concomitantly with any blood product or short-term infusion of concentrated electrolytes, even if the two infusions are running in separate intravenous lines (or cannulas).</span> Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during VFEND therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Intravenous solutions containing (non-concentrated) electrolytes</span></p><p>VFEND I.V. can be infused at the same time as other intravenous solutions containing (non-concentrated) electrolytes, but must be infused through a separate line.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)</span></p><p>VFEND I.V. can be infused at the same time as total parenteral nutrition, but must be infused in a separate line. If infused through a multiple-lumen catheter, TPN needs to be administered using a different port from the one used for VFEND I.V.</p><h3>Recommended Dosing Regimen in Adults</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Invasive aspergillosis and serious fungal infections due to <span class="Italics">Fusarium</span> spp. and <span class="Italics">Scedosporium apiospermum</span></span></p><p>See Table 1. Therapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of intravenous VFEND on Day 1 followed by the recommended maintenance dose (RMD) regimen. Intravenous treatment should be continued for at least 7 days. Once the patient has clinically improved and can tolerate medication given by mouth, the oral tablet form or oral suspension form of VFEND may be utilized. The recommended oral maintenance dose of 200 mg achieves a voriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg intravenously; a 300 mg oral dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg intravenously. Switching between the intravenous and oral formulations is appropriate because of the high bioavailability of the oral formulation in adults <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Candidemia in non-neutropenic patients and other deep tissue <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections</span></p><p>See Table 1. Patients should be treated for at least 14 days following resolution of symptoms or following last positive culture, whichever is longer.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Esophageal Candidiasis</span></p><p>See Table 1. Patients should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and for at least 7 days following resolution of symptoms.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Method for Adjusting the Dosing Regimen in Adults</span></p><p>If patient's response is inadequate, the oral maintenance dose may be increased from 200 mg every 12 hours (similar to 3 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours) to 300 mg every 12 hours (similar to 4 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours). For adult patients weighing less than 40 kg, the oral maintenance dose may be increased from 100 mg every 12 hours to 150 mg every 12 hours. If patient is unable to tolerate 300 mg orally every 12 hours, reduce the oral maintenance dose by 50 mg steps to a minimum of 200 mg every 12 hours (or to 100 mg every 12 hours for adult patients weighing less than 40 kg).</p><p>If patient is unable to tolerate 4 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours, reduce the intravenous maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg every 12 hours.</p><h3>Recommended Dosing Regimen in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosing regimen for pediatric patients 2 to less than 12 years of age and 12 to 14 years of age with body weight less than 50 kg is shown in Table 2. For pediatric patients 12 to 14 years of age with a body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and those 15 years of age and above regardless of body weight, administer the adult dosing regimen of VFEND <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p>Initiate therapy with an intravenous infusion regimen. Consider an oral regimen only after there is a significant clinical improvement. Note that an 8 mg/kg intravenous dose will provide voriconazole exposure approximately 2-fold higher than a 9 mg/kg oral dose.</p><p>The oral dose recommendation for children is based on studies in which VFEND was administered as the powder for oral suspension formulation. Bioequivalence between the VFEND powder for oral suspension and Vfend Tablets has not been investigated in a pediatric population.</p><p>Oral bioavailability may be limited in pediatric patients 2 to 12 years with malabsorption and very low body weight for age. In that case, intravenous VFEND administration is recommended.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Method for Adjusting the Dosing Regimen in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients 2 to less than 12 years of age and 12 to 14 years of age with body weight less than 50 kg</span></p><p>If patient response is inadequate and the patient is able to tolerate the initial intravenous maintenance dose, the maintenance dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps. If patient response is inadequate and the patient is able to tolerate the oral maintenance dose, the dose may be increased by 1 mg/kg steps or 50 mg steps to a maximum of 350 mg every 12 hours. If patients are unable to tolerate the initial intravenous maintenance dose, reduce the dose by 1 mg/kg steps. If patients are unable to tolerate the oral maintenance dose, reduce the dose by 1 mg/kg or 50 mg steps.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric patients 12 to 14 years of age weighing greater than or equal to 50 kg and 15 years of age and older regardless of body weight:</span></p><p>Use the optimal method for titrating dosage recommended for adults <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients With Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The maintenance dose of VFEND should be reduced in adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh Class A and B. There are no PK data to allow for dosage adjustment recommendations in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).</p><p>Duration of therapy should be based on the severity of the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response.</p><p>Adult patients with baseline liver function tests (ALT, AST) of up to 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were included in the clinical program. Dose adjustments are not necessary for adult patients with this degree of abnormal liver function, but continued monitoring of liver function tests for further elevations is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>It is recommended that the recommended VFEND loading dose regimens be used, but that the maintenance dose be halved in adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>VFEND has not been studied in adult patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) or in patients with chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C disease. VFEND has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and with clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice. VFEND should only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Dosage adjustment of VFEND in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment has not been established <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients With Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of orally administered VFEND are not significantly affected by renal impairment. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for <span class="Bold">oral</span> dosing in patients with mild to severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min) who are receiving an intravenous infusion of VFEND, accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous VFEND. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and, if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral VFEND therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><p>Voriconazole is hemodialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. A 4-hour hemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Dosage adjustment of VFEND in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment When Co-Administered With Phenytoin or Efavirenz</h3><p class="First">The maintenance dose of voriconazole should be increased when co-administered with phenytoin or efavirenz. Use the optimal method for titrating dosage <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Preparation and Intravenous Administration of VFEND for Injection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reconstitution</span></p><p>The powder is reconstituted with 19 mL of Water For Injection to obtain an extractable volume of 20 mL of clear concentrate containing 10 mg/mL of voriconazole. It is recommended that a standard 20 mL (non-automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount (19.0 mL) of Water for Injection is dispensed. Discard the vial if a vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. Shake the vial until all the powder is dissolved.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dilution</span></p><p>VFEND must be infused over 1 to 3 hours, at a concentration of 5 mg/mL or less. Therefore, the required volume of the 10 mg/mL VFEND concentrate should be further diluted as follows (appropriate diluents listed below):</p><p>The final VFEND solution must be infused over 1 to 3 hours at a maximum rate of 3 mg/kg per hour.</p><p>VFEND I.V. for Injection is a single-dose unpreserved sterile lyophile. Therefore, from a microbiological point of view, once reconstituted, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). This medicinal product is for single use only and any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solutions without particles should be used.</p><p>The reconstituted solution can be diluted with:</p><p>0.9% Sodium Chloride USP<br/>

5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP</p><p>The compatibility of VFEND I.V. with diluents other than those described above is unknown (see Incompatibilities below).</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Incompatibilities</span></p><p>VFEND I.V. must not be diluted with 4.2% Sodium Bicarbonate Infusion. The mildly alkaline nature of this diluent caused slight degradation of VFEND after 24 hours storage at room temperature. Although refrigerated storage is recommended following reconstitution, use of this diluent is not recommended as a precautionary measure. Compatibility with other concentrations is unknown.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration of VFEND Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reconstitution</span></p><p>Tap the bottle to release the powder. Add 46 mL of water to the bottle. Shake the closed bottle vigorously for about 1 minute. Remove child-resistant cap and push bottle adaptor into the neck of the bottle. Replace the cap.

It is not intended that the suspension be further diluted with water or other vehicles.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Powder for Solution for Injection</span></p><p>VFEND I.V. for Injection is supplied in a single-dose vial as a sterile lyophilized powder equivalent to 200 mg voriconazole and 3,200 mg sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin sodium (SBECD).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tablets</span></p><p>VFEND 50 mg tablets; white, film-coated, round, debossed with "Pfizer" on one side and "VOR50" on the reverse.</p><p>VFEND 200 mg tablets; white, film-coated, capsule shaped, debossed with "Pfizer" on one side and "VOR200" on the reverse.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Powder for Oral Suspension</span></p><p>VFEND for Oral Suspension is supplied as a white to off-white powder in 100 mL high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. Following reconstitution, the volume of white to off white suspension is 75 mL, providing a usable volume of 70 mL. Each mL of the oral suspension contains 40 mg of voriconazole (200 mg of voriconazole per 5 mL).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>VFEND is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients. There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between VFEND (voriconazole) and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing VFEND to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.</li>
<li>Coadministration of cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with VFEND is contraindicated because increased plasma concentrations of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of <span class="Italics">torsade de pointes [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>Coadministration of VFEND with sirolimus is contraindicated because VFEND significantly increases sirolimus concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>Coadministration of VFEND with rifampin, carbamazepine and long-acting barbiturates is contraindicated because these drugs are likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>Coadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg every 24 hours or higher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>Coadministration of VFEND with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations. Coadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg every 12 hours) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>Coadministration of VFEND with rifabutin is contraindicated since VFEND significantly increases rifabutin plasma concentrations and rifabutin also significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>Coadministration of VFEND with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) is contraindicated because VFEND may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids, which may lead to ergotism <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>Coadministration of VFEND with St. John's Wort is contraindicated because this herbal supplement may decrease voriconazole plasma concentration <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Coadministration of VFEND with naloxegol is contraindicated because VFEND may increase plasma concentrations of naloxegol which may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Coadministration of VFEND with tolvaptan is contraindicated because VFEND may increase tolvaptan plasma concentrations and increase risk of adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hepatic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with VFEND (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>A higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the pediatric population <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Hepatic function should be monitored in both adult and pediatric patients.</p><p>Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of VFEND therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, VFEND should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit/risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Some azoles, including VFEND, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as <span class="Italics">torsade de pointes</span>), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.</p><p>VFEND should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Congenital or acquired QT prolongation</li>
<li>Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present</li>
<li>Sinus bradycardia</li>
<li>Existing symptomatic arrhythmias</li>
<li>Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></li>
</ul><p>Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Infusion Related Reactions</h3><p class="First">During infusion of the intravenous formulation of VFEND in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur.</p><h3>Visual Disturbances</h3><p class="First">The effect of VFEND on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field, and color perception should be monitored <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with VFEND. If a patient develops a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, VFEND should be discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First">VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including pediatric patients, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during VFEND treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and VFEND discontinuation should be considered. If VFEND is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term VFEND therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, VFEND should be discontinued. In addition, VFEND has been associated with photosensitivity related skin reactions such as pseudoporphyria, cheilitis, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during VFEND therapy.</p><p>The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with VFEND. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and may have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function.</p><p>Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation of serum creatinine <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Adrenal Dysfunction</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Reversible cases of azole-induced adrenal insufficiency have been reported in patients receiving azoles, including VFEND. Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving azoles with or without concomitant corticosteroids. In patients receiving azoles without corticosteroids adrenal insufficiency is related to direct inhibition of steroidogenesis by azoles. In patients taking corticosteroids, voriconazole associated CYP3A4 inhibition of their metabolism may lead to corticosteroid excess and adrenal suppression <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Cushing's syndrome with and without subsequent adrenal insufficiency has also been reported in patients receiving VFEND concomitantly with corticosteroids.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Patients receiving VFEND and corticosteroids (via all routes of administration) should be carefully monitored for adrenal dysfunction both during and after VFEND treatment. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical care if they develop signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome or adrenal insufficiency.</span></p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.</p><p>In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with fetal malformations, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>If VFEND is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking VFEND, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus.

Success was seen in 4/17 (24%) of these patients.</p><h3>Candidemia in Non-neutropenic Patients and Other Deep Tissue Candida Infections</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole was compared to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole in Study 608, an open-label, comparative study in nonneutropenic patients with candidemia associated with clinical signs of infection. Patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either voriconazole (n=283) or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (n=139). Patients were treated with randomized study drug for a median of 15 days. Most of the candidemia in patients evaluated for efficacy was caused by <span class="Italics">C. albicans</span> (46%), followed by <span class="Italics">C. tropicalis</span> (19%), <span class="Italics">C. parapsilosis</span> (17%), <span class="Italics">C. glabrata</span> (15%), and <span class="Italics">C. krusei</span> (1%).</p><p>An independent Data Review Committee (DRC), blinded to study treatment, reviewed the clinical and mycological data from this study, and generated one assessment of response for each patient. A successful response required all of the following: resolution or improvement in all clinical signs and symptoms of infection, blood cultures negative for <span class="Italics">Candida</span>, infected deep tissue sites negative for <span class="Italics">Candida</span> or resolution of all local signs of infection, and no systemic antifungal therapy other than study drug. The primary analysis, which counted DRC-assessed successes at the fixed time point (12 weeks after End of Therapy [EOT]), demonstrated that voriconazole was comparable to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (response rates of 41% and 41%, respectively) in the treatment of candidemia. Patients who did not have a 12-week assessment for any reason were considered a treatment failure.</p><p>The overall clinical and mycological success rates by <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species in Study 150–608 are presented in Table 15.</p><p>In a secondary analysis, which counted DRC-assessed successes at any time point (EOT, or 2, 6, or 12 weeks after EOT), the response rates were 65% for voriconazole and 71% for the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.</p><p>In Studies 608 and 309/604 (non-comparative study in patients with invasive fungal infections who were refractory to, or intolerant of, other antifungal agents), voriconazole was evaluated in 35 patients with deep tissue <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infections. A favorable response was seen in 4 of 7 patients with intra-abdominal infections, 5 of 6 patients with kidney and bladder wall infections, 3 of 3 patients with deep tissue abscess or wound infection, 1 of 2 patients with pneumonia/pleural space infections, 2 of 4 patients with skin lesions, 1 of 1 patients with mixed intra-abdominal and pulmonary infection, 1 of 2 patients with suppurative phlebitis, 1 of 3 patients with hepatosplenic infection, 1 of 5 patients with osteomyelitis, 0 of 1 with liver infection, and 0 of 1 with cervical lymph node infection.</p><h3>Esophageal Candidiasis (EC)</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of oral voriconazole 200 mg twice daily compared to oral fluconazole 200 mg once daily in the primary treatment of EC was demonstrated in Study 150–305, a double-blind, double-dummy study in immunocompromised patients with endoscopically-proven EC. Patients were treated for a median of 15 days (range 1 to 49 days). Outcome was assessed by repeat endoscopy at end of treatment (EOT). A successful response was defined as a normal endoscopy at EOT or at least a 1 grade improvement over baseline endoscopic score. For patients in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population with only a baseline endoscopy, a successful response was defined as symptomatic cure or improvement at EOT compared to baseline. Voriconazole and fluconazole (200 mg once daily) showed comparable efficacy rates against EC, as presented in Table 16.</p><p>Microbiologic success rates by <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species are presented in Table 17.</p><h3>Other Serious Fungal Pathogens</h3><p class="First">In pooled analyses of patients, voriconazole was shown to be effective against the following additional fungal pathogens:</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Scedosporium apiospermum</span> - Successful response to voriconazole therapy was seen in 15 of 24 patients (63%). Three of these patients relapsed within 4 weeks, including 1 patient with pulmonary, skin and eye infections, 1 patient with cerebral disease, and 1 patient with skin infection. Ten patients had evidence of cerebral disease and 6 of these had a successful outcome (1 relapse). In addition, a successful response was seen in 1 of 3 patients with mixed organism infections.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Fusarium</span> spp. - Nine of 21 (43%) patients were successfully treated with voriconazole. Of these 9 patients, 3 had eye infections, 1 had an eye and blood infection, 1 had a skin infection, 1 had a blood infection alone, 2 had sinus infections, and 1 had disseminated infection (pulmonary, skin, hepatosplenic). Three of these patients (1 with disseminated disease, 1 with an eye infection and 1 with a blood infection) had <span class="Italics">Fusarium solani</span> and were complete successes. Two of these patients relapsed, 1 with a sinus infection and profound neutropenia and 1 post surgical patient with blood and eye infections.</p><h3>Pediatric Studies</h3><p class="First">A total of 22 patients aged 12 to 18 years with IA were included in the adult therapeutic studies. Twelve out of 22 (55%) patients had successful response after treatment with a maintenance dose of voriconazole 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.</p><p>Fifty-three pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years old were treated with voriconazole in two prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter clinical studies.</p><p>One study was designed to enroll pediatric patients with IA or infections with rare molds (such as <span class="Italics">Scedosporium</span> or <span class="Italics">Fusarium</span>). Patients aged 2 to less than 12 years and 12 to 14 years with body weight less than 50 kg received an intravenous VFEND loading dose of 9 mg/kg every 12 hours for the first 24-hours followed by an 8 mg/kg intravenous maintenance dose every 12 hours. After completing 7 days of intravenous therapy patients had an option to switch to oral VFEND. The oral maintenance dose was 9 mg/kg every 12 hours (maximum dose of 350 mg). All other pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years received the adult VFEND dosage regimen. Patients received VFEND for at least 6 weeks and up to a maximum of 12 weeks.</p><p>The study enrolled 31 patients with possible, proven, or probable IA. Fourteen of 31 patients, 5 of whom were 2 to less than 12 years old and 9 of whom were 12 to less than 18 years old, had proven or probable IA and were included in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) efficacy analyses. No patients with rare mold were enrolled. A successful global response was defined as resolution or improvement in clinical signs and symptoms and at least 50% resolution of radiological lesions attributed to IA. The overall rate of successful global response at 6 weeks in the MITT population is presented in Table 18 below.</p><p>The second study enrolled 22 patients with invasive candidiasis including candidemia (ICC) and EC requiring either primary or salvage therapy. Patients with ICC aged 2 to less than 12 years and 12 to 14 years with body weight less than 50 kg received an intravenous VFEND loading dose of 9 mg/kg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours followed by an 8 mg/kg intravenous maintenance dose every 12-hours. After completing 5 days of intravenous therapy patients had an option to switch to oral VFEND. The oral maintenance dose was 9 mg/kg every 12 hours (maximum dose of 350 mg). All other pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years received the adult VFEND dosage regimen. VFEND was administered for at least 14 days after the last positive culture. A maximum of 42 days of treatment was permitted.</p><p>Patients with primary or salvage EC aged 2 to less than 12 years and 12 to 14 years with body weight less than 50 kg received an intravenous VFEND dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours followed by an oral VFEND dose of 9 mg/kg every 12 hours (maximum dose of 350 mg) when criteria for oral switch were met. All other pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years received the adult VFEND dosage regimen. VFEND was administered for at least 7 days after the resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. A maximum of 42 days of treatment was permitted.</p><p>For EC, study treatment was initiated without a loading dose of intravenous voriconazole. Seventeen of these patients had confirmed <span class="Italics">Candida</span> infection and were included in the MITT efficacy analyses. Of the 17 patients included in the MITT analyses, 9 were 2 to less than 12 years old (7 with ICC and 2 with EC) and 8 were 12 to less than18 years old (all with EC). For ICC and EC, a successful global response was defined as clinical cure or improvement with microbiological eradication or presumed eradication. The overall rate of successful global response at EOT in the MITT population is presented in Table 19 below.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Powder for Solution for Injection</span></p><p>VFEND I.V. for Injection is supplied in a single-dose vial as a sterile lyophilized powder equivalent to 200 mg voriconazole and 3,200 mg sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin sodium (SBECD).
