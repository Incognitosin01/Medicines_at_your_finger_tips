Exercise caution in pediatric patients with eGFR between 40 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>. If treatment is needed, use the minimum effective dose and monitor renal function frequently. Individualize dose titration based on improvement in renal injury <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>. For patients with renal impairment (eGFR 40–60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) reduce the starting dose by 50% <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>Deferasirox Tablets can cause acute kidney injury including renal failure requiring dialysis that has resulted in fatal outcomes. Based on postmarketing experience, most fatalities have occurred in patients with multiple comorbidities and who were in advanced stages of their hematological disorders. In the clinical trials, adults and pediatric deferasirox-treated patients with no preexisting renal disease experienced dose-dependent mild, non-progressive increases in serum creatinine and proteinuria. Preexisting renal disease and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in adult and pediatric patients. Acute illnesses associated with volume depletion and overchelation may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients, small decreases in eGFR can result in increases in deferasirox exposure, particularly in younger patients with body surface area typical of patients less than age 7 years. This can lead to a cycle of worsening renal function and further increases in Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension exposure, unless the dose is reduced or interrupted. Renal tubular toxicity, including acquired Fanconi syndrome, has been reported in patients treated with deferasirox, most commonly in pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia and serum ferritin levels less than 1,500 mcg/L <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4</span>), <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Evaluate renal glomerular and tubular function before initiating therapy or increasing the dose. Use prediction equations validated for use in adult and pediatric patients to estimate GFR. Obtain serum electrolytes and urinalysis in all patients to evaluate renal tubular function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1,2.2)].</span></p><p>Monitor all patients for changes in eGFR and for renal tubular toxicity weekly during the first month after initiation or modification of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of renal tubular function and/or as clinically indicated. Monitor serum ferritin monthly to evaluate for overchelation</p><p>Use the minimum dose to establish and maintain a low iron burden. Monitor renal function more frequently in patients with preexisting renal disease or decreased renal function. In pediatric patients, interrupt deferasirox tablet during acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor renal function more frequently. Promptly correct fluid deficits to prevent renal injury. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Toxicity and Failure</h3><p class="First">Deferasirox can cause hepatic injury, fatal in some patients. In Study 1, 4 patients (1.3%) discontinued deferasirox because of hepatic toxicity (drug-induced hepatitis in 2 patients and increased serum transaminases in 2 additional patients). Hepatic toxicity appears to be more common in patients greater than 55 years of age. Hepatic failure was more common in patients with significant comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis and multiorgan failure <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Acute liver injury and failure, including fatal outcomes, have occurred in pediatric deferasirox-treated patients. Liver failure occurred in association with acute kidney injury in pediatric patients at risk for overchelation during a volume-depleting event. Interrupt Deferasirox Tablets therapy when acute liver injury or acute kidney injury is suspected and during volume depletion<span class="Italics">.</span> Monitor liver and renal function more frequently in pediatric patients who are receiving Deferasirox Tablets in the 14-28 mg/kg/day range and when iron burden is approaching normal. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Measure transaminases [ aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT)] and bilirubin in all patients before the initiation of treatment and every 2 weeks during the first month and at least monthly thereafter. Consider dose modifications or interruption of treatment for severe or persistent elevations.</p><p>Avoid the use of Deferasirox Tablets in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Reduce the starting dose in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>. Patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment may be at higher risk for hepatic toxicity.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal (GI) Ulceration, Hemorrhage, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">GI hemorrhage, including deaths, has been reported, especially in elderly patients who had advanced hematologic malignancies and/or low platelet counts. Nonfatal upper GI irritation, ulceration and hemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children and adolescents, receiving deferasirox <span class="Italics">[see Adverse</span> <span class="Italics">Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Monitor for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and hemorrhage during deferasirox tablet therapy, and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse reaction is suspected. The risk of GI hemorrhage may be increased when administering Deferasirox Tablets in combination with drugs that have ulcerogenic or hemorrhagic potential, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, oral bisphosphonates, or anticoagulants. There have been reports of ulcers complicated with GI perforation (including fatal outcome) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Bone Marrow Suppression</h3><p class="First">Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, worsening anemia, and thrombocytopenia, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with deferasirox. Preexisting hematologic disorders may increase this risk. Monitor blood counts in all patients. Interrupt treatment with Deferasirox Tablets in patients who develop cytopenias until the cause of the cytopenia has been determined.

These events were frequently associated with volume depletion or with continued Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension doses in the 20-40 mg/kg/day range equivalent to 14-28 mg/kg/day deferasirox when body iron burden was approaching or in the normal range. Interrupt Deferasirox Tablets in patients with volume depletion, and resume Deferasirox Tablets when renal function and fluid volume have normalized. Monitor liver and renal function more frequently during volume depletion and in patients receiving Deferasirox Tablets in the 14-28 mg/kg/day range when iron burden is approaching the normal range. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>5.6 Overchelation</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">For patients with transfusional iron overload, measure serum ferritin monthly to assess the patient's response to therapy and minimize the risk of overchelation. An analysis of pediatric patients treated with Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension in pooled clinical trials (n = 158), found a higher rate of renal adverse reactions among patients receiving doses greater than 25 mg/kg/day equivalent to 17.5 mg/kg/day deferasirox, while their serum ferritin values were less than 1,000 mcg/L. Consider dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and hepatic function, and serum ferritin levels during these periods.

If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt therapy with Deferasirox Tablets and continue monthly monitoring. Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation for patients whose conditions do not require regular blood transfusions. Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range. Continued administration of Deferasirox Tablets in the 14 to 28 mg/kg/day range, when the body iron burden is approaching or within the normal range can result in life threatening adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p>For patients with NTDT, measure LIC by liver biopsy or by using an FDA-cleared or approved method for monitoring patients receiving deferasirox therapy every 6 months on treatment.

Deferasirox was evaluated in healthy volunteer trials. Currently, there are no clinical data in patients with Deferasirox Tablets. Deferasirox tablet contains the same active ingredient as Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension. The following adverse reactions have been reported with Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Transfusional Iron Overload</span></p><p>A total of 700 adult and pediatric patients were treated with deferasirox for 48 weeks in premarketing studies. These included 469 patients with beta-thalassemia, 99 with rare anemias, and 132 with sickle cell disease. Of these patients, 45% were male, 70% were Caucasian and 292 patients were less than 16 years of age. In the sickle cell disease population, 89% of patients were black. Median treatment duration among the sickle cell patients was 51 weeks. Of the 700 patients treated, 469 (403 beta-thalassemia and 66 rare anemias) were entered into extensions of the original clinical protocols. In ongoing extension studies, median durations of treatment were 88 to 205 weeks.</p><p>Six hundred twenty-seven (627) patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were enrolled across 5 uncontrolled trials.

Of the patients who experienced creatinine increases in Study 3, 8 deferasirox-treated patients required dose reductions. In this study, 5 patients in the deferasirox group developed elevations in SGPT/ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN at 2 consecutive visits and 1 patient subsequently had deferasirox permanently discontinued. Four additional patients discontinued due to adverse reactions with a suspected relationship to study drug, including diarrhea, pancreatitis associated with gallstones, atypical tuberculosis, and skin rash.</p><p>In the MDS pool, in the first year, a total of 229 (37%) patients treated with deferasirox had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 consecutive occasions (Table 2) and 8 (3.5%) patients permanently discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.

However, due to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation's marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Four hundred thirty-one (431) patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age were studied in clinical trials of deferasirox in the transfusional iron overload setting. Two hundred twenty-five (225) of these patients were between 65 and 75 years of age while 206 were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The majority of these patients had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 393). In these trials, elderly patients experienced a higher frequency of adverse reactions than younger patients. Monitor elderly patients for early signs or symptoms of adverse reactions that may require a dose adjustment. Elderly patients are at increased risk for toxicity due to the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. In elderly patients, including those with MDS, individualize the decision to remove accumulated iron based on clinical circumstances and the anticipated clinical benefit and risks of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Deferasirox tablet is contraindicated in patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. For patients with renal impairment (eGFR 40 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>), reduce the starting dose by 50% <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.

In one case, this resulted in hepatitis which resolved without long-term consequences after a dose interruption. In one pediatric case, a dose of 2-3 times the prescribed dose for 6 days resulted in acute renal failure requiring hemofiltration and acute liver injury/failure, which were reversible with intensive care support. Single doses of deferasirox up to 80 mg per kg per day with the tablet for oral suspension formulation in iron-overloaded beta-thalassemic patients have been tolerated with nausea and diarrhea noted. In healthy subjects, single doses of up to 40 mg per kg per day with the tablet for oral suspension formulation were tolerated.</p><p>Early signs of acute overdose are digestive effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Hepatic and renal disorders have been reported, including cases of liver enzyme and creatinine increased with recovery after treatment discontinuation. An erroneously administered single dose of 90 mg/kg led to Fanconi syndrome which resolved after treatment.</p><p>There is no specific antidote for deferasirox. In case of overdose, it may be treated with induction of vomiting or gastric lavage, and by symptomatic treatment.</p><h2>Deferasirox Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Deferasirox is an iron-chelating agent provided as a tablet for oral use. Deferasirox is designated chemically as 4-[3,5-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]benzoic acid and has the following structural formula:</p><p>Deferasirox is a white to slightly yellow powder. It has a molecular formula C<span class="Sub">21</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span> and molecular weight of 373.4 g/mol. It is insoluble in water with a pH of suspension of 4.1.</p><p>Deferasirox Tablets contain 90 mg, 180 mg, or 360 mg deferasirox. Inactive ingredients include crospovidone, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, poloxamer (188), povidone (K30) and purified water. The film coating contains hypromellose, iron oxide red, macrogol, talc and titanium dioxide.</p><h2>Deferasirox Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is selective for iron (as Fe<span class="Sup">3+</span>). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Although deferasirox has very low affinity for zinc and copper, there are variable decreases in the serum concentration of these trace metals after the administration of deferasirox. The clinical significance of these decreases is uncertain.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Pharmacodynamic effects tested in an iron balance metabolic study with the tablet for oral suspension formulation showed that deferasirox (10, 20, and 40 mg per kg per day) was able to induce a mean net iron excretion (0.119, 0.329, and 0.445 mg Fe/kg body weight per day, respectively) within the clinically relevant range (0.1 to 0.5 mg per kg per day). Iron excretion was predominantly fecal.</p><p>An analysis of pooled pediatric clinical trial data found a statistically significant relationship between exposure and the probability of renal toxicity (increase in serum creatinine and urinary protein), resulting in a decrease in renal function. Decreases in renal function resulted in an increase in deferasirox exposure which may increase the probability of renal toxicity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>At the maximum approved recommended dose, deferasirox does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Based on studies in patients with the tablet for oral suspension, deferasirox is absorbed following oral administration with median times to maximum plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) of about 1.5 to 4 hours. In healthy subjects, deferasirox showed comparable T<span class="Sub">max</span>. The maximal concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the curve (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">τ</span>) of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose after both single administration and under steady-state conditions. Exposure to deferasirox increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3 after multiple doses with the tablet for oral suspension formulation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tablets</span></p><p>The absolute bioavailability [as measured by area under the curve over time to infinity (AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>)] of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension is 70% compared to an intravenous dose. The bioavailability (as measured by AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) of Deferasirox Tablets was 36% greater than with Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension. After strength-adjustment, the mean AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> of Deferasirox Tablets (i.e., 360 mg strength) was similar to that of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension (i.e., 500 mg strength) under fasting conditions; however the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was increased by 30%. The 30% increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> observed with deferasirox tablet is not clinically meaningful.</p><p>The administration of Deferasirox Tablets with a light meal (approximately 250 calories with fat content less than 7% of total calories) indicated that the AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were similar to that under fasting conditions. The administration of Deferasirox Tablets with a high-fat meal (approximately 1,000 calories with fat content greater than 50% of total calories), increased AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> by 18% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 29% compared to that under fasting conditions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Deferasirox is highly (~99%) protein bound almost exclusively to serum albumin. The percentage of deferasirox confined to the blood cells was 5% in humans. The volume of distribution at steady state (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) of deferasirox is 14.37 ± 2.69 L in adults.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion. Deconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) is likely to occur. Deferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. CYP450-catalyzed (oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%). Deconjugation of glucuronide metabolites in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) was confirmed in a healthy subjects study in which the administration of cholestyramine 12 g twice daily (strongly binds to deferasirox and its conjugates) 4 and 10 hours after a single dose of deferasirox resulted in a 45% decrease in deferasirox exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>) by interfering with the enterohepatic recycling of deferasirox.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Deferasirox and metabolites are primarily (84% of the dose) excreted in the feces. Renal excretion of deferasirox and metabolites is minimal (8% of the dose).

There are no clinical data in patients with deferasirox. Deferasirox tablet contains the same active ingredient as Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension. The following information is based on clinical trials conducted with Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Transfusional Iron Overload</span></p><p>The primary efficacy study, Study 1 (NCT00061750), was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-comparator control study to compare Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension and deferoxamine in patients with beta-thalassemia and transfusional hemosiderosis. Patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension at starting doses of 5, 10, 20, or 30 mg per kg once daily or subcutaneous deferoxamine at starting doses of 20 to 60 mg per kg for at least 5 days per week based on LIC at baseline (2 to 3, greater than 3 to 7, greater than 7 to 14, and greater than 14 mg Fe/g dry weight). Patients randomized to deferoxamine who had LIC values less than 7 mg Fe/g dry weight were permitted to continue on their prior deferoxamine dose, even though the dose may have been higher than specified in the protocol.</p><p>Patients were to have a liver biopsy at baseline and end of study (after 12 months) for LIC. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a reduction in LIC of greater than or equal to 3 mg Fe/g dry weight for baseline values greater than or equal to 10 mg Fe/g dry weight, reduction of baseline values between 7 and less than 10 to less than 7 mg Fe/g dry weight, or maintenance or reduction for baseline values less than 7 mg Fe/g dry weight.</p><p>A total of 586 patients were randomized and treated, 296 with Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension and 290 with deferoxamine. The mean age was 17.1 years (range, 2 to 53 years); 52% were females and 88% were Caucasian. The primary efficacy population consisted of 553 patients (Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension n = 276; deferoxamine n = 277) who had LIC evaluated at baseline and 12 months or discontinued due to an adverse reaction. The percentage of patients achieving the primary endpoint was 52.9% for Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension and 66.4% for deferoxamine. The relative efficacy of deferasirox to deferoxamine cannot be determined from this study.</p><p>In patients who had an LIC at baseline and at end of study, the mean change in LIC was -2.4 mg Fe/g dry weight in patients treated with Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension and -2.9 mg Fe/g dry weight in patients treated with deferoxamine.</p><p>Reduction of LIC and serum ferritin was observed with deferasirox tablet for oral suspension doses of 20 to 30 mg per kg per day. Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension doses below 20 mg per kg per day failed to provide consistent lowering of LIC and serum ferritin levels (Figure 1). Therefore, a starting dose of 20 mg per kg per day is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1.

Nineteen percent (19%) of patients were less than 16 years of age and 16% were greater than or equal to 65 years of age. There was a reduction in the absolute LIC from baseline to end of study (-4.2 mg Fe/g dry weight).</p><p>Study 3 (NCT00067080) was a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension relative to deferoxamine given for 1 year in patients with sickle cell disease and transfusional hemosiderosis. Patients were randomized to Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension at doses of 5, 10, 20, or 30 mg per kg per day or subcutaneous deferoxamine at doses of 20-60 mg per kg per day for 5 days per week according to baseline LIC.</p><p>A total of 195 patients were treated in this study: 132 with Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension and 63 with deferoxamine. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients were less than 16 years of age and 91% were black. At end of study, the mean change in LIC (as measured by magnetic susceptometry by a superconducting quantum interference device) in the per protocol-1 (PP-1) population, which consisted of patients who had at least 1 post-baseline LIC assessment, was -1.3 mg Fe/g dry weight for patients receiving Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension (n = 113) and -0.7 mg Fe/g dry weight for patients receiving deferoxamine (n = 54).</p><p>One-hundred five (105) patients with thalassemia major and cardiac iron overload were enrolled in a study assessing the change in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2* value (measured in milliseconds, [ms]) before and after treatment with deferasirox. Cardiac T2* values at baseline ranged from 5 to less than 20 ms. The geometric mean of cardiac T2* in the 68 patients who completed 3 years of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension therapy increased from 11.98 ms at baseline to 17.12 ms at 3 years. Cardiac T2* values improved in patients with severe cardiac iron overload (less than 10 ms) and in those with mild to moderate cardiac iron overload (greater than or equal to 10 to less than 20 ms). The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.</p><p>Six hundred twenty-seven (627) patients with MDS were enrolled across 5 uncontrolled trials. Two hundred thirty-nine of the 627 patients were enrolled in trials that limited enrollment to patients with IPSS Low or Intermediate 1 risk MDS, and the remaining 388 patients were enrolled in trials that did not specify MDS risk stratification but required a life expectancy of greater than 1 year. Planned duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 year (365 patients) to 5 years (47 patients). These trials evaluated the effects of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension therapy on parameters of iron overload, including LIC (125 patients) and serum ferritin (627 patients). The percent of patients completing planned duration of treatment was 51% in the largest 1-year study, 52% in the 3-year study and 22% in the 5-year study. The major causes for treatment discontinuation were withdrawal of consent, adverse reaction, and death. Over 1 year of follow-up across these pooled studies, mean change in serum ferritin was -332.8 (±2615.59) mcg/L (n = 593) and mean change in LIC was -5.9 (±8.32) mg Fe/g dw (n = 68). Results of these pooled studies in 627 patients with MDS suggest a progressive decrease in serum ferritin and LIC beyond 1 year in those patients who are able to continue Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia</span></p><p>Study 5(NCT00873041) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension for patients 10 years of age or older with NTDT syndromes and iron overload. Eligible patients had an LIC of at least 5 mg Fe/g dw measured by R2 MRI and a serum ferritin exceeding 300 mcg/L at screening (2 consecutive values at least 14 days apart from each other). A total of 166 patients were randomized, 55 to the Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension 5 mg/kg/day dose group, 55 to the Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension 10 mg/kg/day dose group, and 56 to placebo (28 to each matching placebo group). Doses could be increased after 6 months if the LIC exceeded 7 mg Fe/g dw and the LIC reduction from baseline was less than 15%. The patients enrolled included 89 males and 77 females. The underlying disease was betathalassemia intermedia in 95 (57%) patients, HbE beta-thalassemia in 49 (30%) patients, and alpha-thalassemia in 22 (13%) patients. There were 17 pediatric patients in the study. Caucasians comprised 57% of the study population and Asians comprised 42%. The median baseline LIC (range) for all patients was 12.1 (2.6 to 49.1) mg Fe/g dw. Follow-up was for 1 year. The primary efficacy endpoint of change in LIC from baseline to Week 52 was statistically significant in favor of both deferasirox dose groups compared with placebo (p less than or equal to 0.001) (Table 5). Furthermore, a statistically significant dose effect of deferasirox was observed in favor of the 10 mg/kg/day dose group (10 versus 5 mg/kg/day, p = 0.009). In a descriptive analysis, the target LIC (less than 5 mg Fe/g dw) was reached by 15 (27%) of 55 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day arm, 8 (15%) of 55 patients in the 5 mg/kg/day arm and 2 (4%) of 56 patients in the combined placebo groups.</p><p>Study 6 (NCT00873041) was an open-label trial of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension for the treatment of patients previously enrolled on Study 5, including cross-over to active treatment for those previously treated with placebo. The starting dose of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension in Study 6 was assigned based on the patient's LIC at completion of Study 5, being 20 mg/kg/day for an LIC exceeding 15 mg Fe/g dw, 10 mg/kg/day for LIC 3 to 15 mg Fe/g dw, and observation if the LIC was less than 3 mg Fe/g dw. Patients could continue on 5 mg/kg/day if they had previously exhibited at least a 30% reduction in LIC. Doses could be increased to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day after 6 months if the LIC was more than 7 mg Fe/g dw and the LIC reduction from baseline was less than 15%. The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 6 was the proportion of patients achieving an LIC less than 5 mg Fe/g dw. A total of 133 patients were enrolled. Twenty patients began Study 6 with an LIC less than 5 mg Fe/g dw. Of the 113 patients with a baseline LIC of at least 5 mg Fe/g dw in Study 6, the target LIC (less than 5 mg Fe/g dw) was reached by 39 patients (35%). The responders included 4 (10%) of 39 patients treated at 20 mg/kg/day for a baseline LIC exceeding 15 mg Fe/g dw, and 31 (51%) of 61 patients treated at 10 mg/kg/day for a baseline LIC between 5 and 15 mg Fe/g dw. The absolute change in LIC at Week 52 by starting dose is shown in Table 5 below.</p><p>Study 7 (NCT01709838) was an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, 5-year study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension in iron overloaded patients with NTDT of 10 years of age or older. All patients started treatment on 10 mg/kg/day Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension for four weeks. At Week 4, dose escalation was based on baseline LIC. At Week 24 and every 6 months thereafter, further dose adjustments were made according to the LIC at that visit. Treatment was interrupted when LIC &lt; 3 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin &lt; 300 ng/mL and was re-started at 10 mg/kg/day when LIC ≥ 5 mg Fe/g dw and serum ferritin ≥ 300 ng/mL. Throughout the study, the maximum dose of Deferasirox Tablets for oral suspension given was 30 mg/kg/day.</p><p>A total of 134 patients were enrolled in the study. Eligible patients were required to have an LIC of at least 5 mg Fe/g dw measured by R2 MRI and a serum ferritin at least of 300 ng/mL at screening. The mean absolute change of LIC from Baseline to Week 52 was -6.7 mg Fe/g dw. The reduction in LIC was sustained until Week 260 (5 years) with the mean absolute change in LIC from Baseline to Week 260 of -10.6 mg Fe/g dw.
