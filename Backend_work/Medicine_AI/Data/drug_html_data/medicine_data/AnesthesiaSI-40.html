Propofol is chemically described as 2,6-diisopropylphenol. The structural formula is:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">DIPRIVAN Structural Formula</p><p>Propofol is slightly soluble in water and, thus, is formulated in a white, oil-in-water emulsion.  The pKa is 11. The octanol/water partition coefficient for propofol is 6761:1 at a pH of 6 to 8.5. In addition to the active component, propofol, the formulation also contains soybean oil (100 mg/mL), glycerol (22.5 mg/mL), egg lecithin (12 mg/mL); and disodium edetate (0.005%); with sodium hydroxide to adjust pH.  DIPRIVAN is isotonic and has a pH of 7 to 8.5.</p><h2>Anesthesia S/I-40 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">General</span></span></p><p>DIPRIVAN is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 minute to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia. The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAA receptors.<br/></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></span><br/>
Pharmacodynamic properties of propofol are dependent upon the therapeutic blood propofol concentrations. Steady-state propofol blood concentrations are generally proportional to infusion rates. Undesirable side effects, such as cardiorespiratory depression, are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in infusion rates. An adequate interval (3 minutes to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments in order to assess clinical effects.<br/></p><p>The hemodynamic effects of  DIPRIVAN during induction of anesthesia vary. If spontaneous ventilation is maintained, the major cardiovascular effect is arterial hypotension (sometimes greater than a 30% decrease) with little or no change in heart rate and no appreciable decrease in cardiac output. If ventilation is assisted or controlled (positive pressure ventilation), there is an increase in the incidence and the degree of depression of cardiac output. Addition of an opioid, used as a premedicant, further decreases cardiac output and respiratory drive.<br/></p><p>If anesthesia is continued by infusion of  DIPRIVAN, the stimulation of endotracheal intubation and surgery may return arterial pressure towards normal. However, cardiac output may remain depressed. Comparative clinical studies have shown that the hemodynamic effects of  DIPRIVAN during induction of anesthesia are generally more pronounced than with other intravenous (IV) induction agents.<br/></p><p>Induction of anesthesia with DIPRIVAN is frequently associated with apnea in both adults and pediatric patients. In adult patients who received DIPRIVAN (2 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg), apnea lasted less than 30 seconds in 7% of patients, 30 seconds to 60 seconds in 24% of patients, and more than 60 seconds in 12% of patients. In pediatric patients from birth through 16 years of age assessable for apnea who received bolus doses of  DIPRIVAN (1 mg/kg to 3.6 mg/kg), apnea lasted less than 30 seconds in 12% of patients, 30 seconds to 60 seconds in 10% of patients, and more than 60 seconds in 5% of patients.<br/></p><p>During maintenance of general anesthesia, DIPRIVAN causes a decrease in spontaneous minute ventilation usually associated with an increase in carbon dioxide tension which may be marked depending upon the rate of administration and concurrent use of other medications (e.g., opioids, sedatives, etc.).<br/></p><p>During monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation, attention must be given to the cardiorespiratory effects of  DIPRIVAN. Hypotension, oxyhemoglobin desaturation, apnea, and airway obstruction can occur, especially following a rapid bolus of  DIPRIVAN. During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus administration in order to minimize undesirable cardiorespiratory effects. In the elderly, debilitated, or American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).<br/></p><p>Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that DIPRIVAN is rarely associated with elevation of plasma histamine levels.</p><p>Preliminary findings in patients with normal intraocular pressure indicate that DIPRIVAN produces a decrease in intraocular pressure which may be associated with a concomitant decrease in systemic vascular resistance.</p><p>Clinical studies indicate that DIPRIVAN when used in combination with hypocarbia increases cerebrovascular resistance and decreases cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption, and intracranial pressure. DIPRIVAN does not affect cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension (see <span class="Bold">Clinical Trials, Neuroanesthesia</span>).<br/></p><p>Clinical studies indicate that DIPRIVAN does not suppress the adrenal response to ACTH.<br/></p><p>Animal studies and limited experience in susceptible patients have not indicated any propensity of DIPRIVAN to induce malignant hyperthermia.</p><p>Hemosiderin deposits have been observed in the livers of dogs receiving DIPRIVAN containing 0.005% disodium edetate over a four-week period; the clinical significance of this is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span></span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of propofol are well described by a three compartment linear model with compartments representing the plasma, rapidly equilibrating tissues, and slowly equilibrating tissues.<br/></p><p>Following an IV bolus dose, there is rapid equilibration between the plasma and the brain, accounting for the rapid onset of anesthesia.  Plasma levels initially decline rapidly as a result of both distribution and metabolic clearance.  Distribution accounts for about half of this decline following a bolus of propofol.  However, distribution is not constant over time, but decreases as body tissues equilibrate with plasma and become saturated.  The rate at which equilibration occurs is a function of the rate and duration of the infusion.  When equilibration occurs there is no longer a net transfer of propofol between tissues and plasma.<br/></p><p>Discontinuation of the recommended doses of DIPRIVAN after the maintenance of anesthesia for approximately one hour, or for sedation in the ICU for one day, results in a prompt decrease in blood propofol concentrations and rapid awakening.  Longer infusions (10 days of ICU sedation) result in accumulation of significant tissue stores of propofol, such that the reduction in circulating propofol is slowed and the time to awakening is increased.<br/></p><p>By daily titration of DIPRIVAN dosage to achieve only the minimum effective therapeutic concentration, rapid awakening within 10 minutes to 15 minutes can occur even after long-term administration.  If, however, higher than necessary infusion levels have been maintained for a long time, propofol redistribution from fat and muscle to the plasma can be significant and slow recovery.<br/></p><p>The figure below illustrates the fall of plasma propofol levels following infusions of various durations to provide ICU sedation.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"></span></span></p><p class="MultiMediaCaptionNotCentered"><span class="Bold">Fall of Plasma Propofol Levels Following Infusion</span></p><p>The large contribution of distribution (about 50%) to the fall of propofol plasma levels following brief infusions means that after very long infusions a reduction in the infusion rate is appropriate by as much as half the initial infusion rate in order to maintain a constant plasma level.  Therefore, failure to reduce the infusion rate in patients receiving DIPRIVAN for extended periods may result in excessively high blood concentrations of the drug.  Thus, titration to clinical response and daily evaluation of sedation levels are important during use of DIPRIVAN infusion for ICU sedation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>Propofol clearance ranges from 23 mL/kg/min to 50 mL/kg/min (1.6 L/min to 3.4 L/min in 70 kg adults). It is chiefly eliminated by hepatic conjugation to inactive metabolites which are excreted by the kidney. A glucuronide conjugate accounts for about 50% of the administered dose.  Propofol has a<br/>
steady-state volume of distribution (10-day infusion) approaching 60 L/kg in healthy adults.  A difference in pharmacokinetics due to sex has not been observed.  The terminal half-life of propofol after a 10-day infusion is 1 day to 3 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatrics</span></p><p>With increasing patient age, the dose of propofol needed to achieve a defined anesthetic end point (dose-requirement) decreases.  This does not appear to be an age-related change in pharmacodynamics or brain sensitivity, as measured by EEG burst suppression.  With increasing patient age, pharmacokinetic changes are such that, for a given IV bolus dose, higher peak plasma concentrations occur, which can explain the decreased dose requirement.  These higher peak plasma concentrations in the elderly can predispose patients to cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or arterial oxygen desaturation.  The higher plasma levels reflect an age-related decrease in volume of distribution and intercompartmental clearance.  Lower doses are therefore recommended for initiation and maintenance of sedation and anesthesia in elderly patients (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><br/></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of propofol were studied in children between 3 years and 12 years of age who received DIPRIVAN for periods of approximately 1 hour to 2 hours. The observed distribution and clearance of propofol in these children were similar to adults.</p><p><span class="Bold">Organ Failure</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of propofol do not appear to be different in people with chronic hepatic cirrhosis or chronic renal impairment compared to adults with normal hepatic and renal function.  The effects of acute hepatic or renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of propofol have not been studied.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Anesthesia and Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) Sedation<br/>
Pediatric Anesthesia<br/></span> DIPRIVAN was studied in clinical trials which included cardiac surgical patients.  Most patients were 3 years of age or older. The majority of the patients were healthy ASA-PS I or II patients. The range of doses in these studies are described in Tables 1 and 2.</p><p><span class="Bold">TABLE 1.

The mean lesion size (anterior/posterior x lateral) was 31 mm x 32 mm in one trial and 55 mm x 42 mm in the other trial respectively. Anesthesia was induced with a median DIPRIVAN dose of 1.4 mg/kg (range: 0.9 mg/kg to 6.9 mg/kg) and maintained with a median maintenance DIPRIVAN dose of 146 mcg/kg/min (range: 68 mcg/kg/min to 425 mcg/kg/min). The median duration of the DIPRIVAN maintenance infusion was 285 minutes (range: 48 minutes to 622 minutes).</p><p>DIPRIVAN was administered by infusion in a controlled clinical trial to evaluate its effect on cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP).  The mean arterial pressure was maintained relatively constant over 25 minutes with a change from baseline of -4% Â± 17% (mean Â± SD). The change in CSFP was - 46% Â± 14%.  As CSFP is an indirect measure of intracranial pressure (ICP), DIPRIVAN, when given by infusion or slow bolus in co   bination with hypocarbia, is capable of decreasing ICP independent of changes in arterial pressure. <span class="Bold"><br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Sedation</span><br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span><br/>
DIPRIVAN was compared to benzodiazepines and opioids in clinical trials involving ICU patients. Of these, 302 received DIPRIVAN and comprise the overall safety database for ICU sedation.</p><p>Across all clinical studies, the mean infusion maintenance rate for all DIPRIVAN patients was 27 Â± 21 mcg/kg/min. The maintenance infusion rates required to maintain adequate sedation ranged from 2.8 mcg/kg/min to 130 mcg/kg/min. The infusion rate was lower in patients over 55 years of age (approximately 20 mcg/kg/min) compared to patients under 55 years of age (approximately 38 mcg/kg/min). Although there are reports of reduced analgesic requirements, most patients received opioids for analgesia during maintenance of ICU sedation. In these studies, morphine or fentanyl was used as needed for analgesia. Some patients also received benzodiazepines and/or neuromuscular blocking agents. During long-term maintenance of sedation, some ICU patients were awakened once or twice every 24 hours for assessment of neurologic or respiratory function.<br/></p><p>In Medical and Postsurgical ICU studies comparing DIPRIVAN to benzodiazepine infusion or bolus, there were no apparent differences in maintenance of adequate sedation, mean arterial pressure, or laboratory findings. Like the comparators, DIPRIVAN reduced blood cortisol during sedation while maintaining responsivity to challenges with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Case reports from the published literature generally reflect that DIPRIVAN has been used safely in patients with a history of porphyria or malignant hyperthermia.<br/></p><p>In hemodynamically stable head trauma patients ranging in age from 19 years to 43 years, adequate sedation was maintained with DIPRIVAN or morphine. There were no apparent differences in adequacy of sedation, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, or neurologic recovery between the treatment groups. In literature reports of severely head-injured patients in Neurosurgical ICUs, DIPRIVAN infusion and hyperventilation, both with and without diuretics, controlled intracranial pressure while maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure. In some patients, bolus doses resulted in decreased blood pressure and compromised cerebral perfusion pressure.<br/></p><p>DIPRIVAN was found to be effective in status epilepticus which was refractory to the standard anticonvulsant therapies. For these patients, as well as for ARDS/respiratory failure and tetanus patients, sedation maintenance dosages were generally higher than those for other critically ill patient populations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients<br/></span> A single, randomized, controlled, clinical trial that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of DIPRIVAN versus standard sedative agents (SSA) was conducted on 327 pediatric ICU patients. Patients were randomized to receive either DIPRIVAN 2%, (113 patients), DIPRIVAN 1%, (109 patients), or an SSA (e.g., lorazepam, chloral hydrate, fentanyl, ketamine, morphine, or phenobarbital). DIPRIVAN therapy was initiated at an infusion rate of 5.5 mg/kg/hr and titrated as needed to maintain sedation at a standardized level. The results of the study showed an increase in the number of deaths in patients treated with DIPRIVAN as compared to SSAs. Of the 25 patients who died during the trial or within the 28-day follow-up period: 12 (11% were) in the DIPRIVAN 2% treatment group, 9 (8% were) in the DIPRIVAN 1% treatment group, and 4% were (4%) in the SSA treatment group. The differences in mortality rate between the groups were not statistically significant. Review of the deaths failed to reveal a correlation with underlying disease status or a correlation to the drug or a definitive pattern to the causes of death. <span class="Bold"><br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Anesthesia</span><br/>
DIPRIVAN was evaluated in clinical trials involving patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).</p><p>In post-CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) patients, the maintenance rate of propofol administration was usually low (median 11 mcg/kg/min) due to the intraoperative administration of high opioid doses. Patients receiving DIPRIVAN required 35% less nitroprusside than midazolam patients. During initiation of sedation in post-CABG patients, a 15% to 20% decrease in blood pressure was seen in the first 60 minutes. It was not possible to determine cardiovascular effects in patients with severely compromised ventricular function.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Anesthesia S/I-40</h2><p class="First">DIPRIVAN is an IV general anesthetic and sedation drug that can be used as described in the table below.<br/></p><p>Safety, effectiveness and dosing guidelines for DIPRIVAN have not been established for MAC Sedation in the pediatric population; therefore, it is not recommended for this use (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, <span class="Italics">Pediatric Use</span></span>).</p><p>DIPRIVAN is not recommended for induction of anesthesia below the age of 3 years or for maintenance of anesthesia below the age of 2 months because its safety and effectiveness have not been established in those populations.<br/></p><p>In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), DIPRIVAN can be administered to intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients to provide continuous sedation and control of stress responses only by persons skilled in the medical management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management.<br/></p><p>DIPRIVAN is not indicated for use in Pediatric ICU sedation since the safety of this regimen has not been established (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, <span class="Italics">Pediatric Use</span></span>).<br/>
DIPRIVAN is not recommended for obstetrics, including Cesarean section deliveries. DIPRIVAN crosses the placenta, and as with other general anesthetic agents, the administration of  DIPRIVAN may be associated with neonatal depression (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>).<br/></p><p>DIPRIVAN is not recommended for use in nursing mothers because propofol has been reported to be excreted in human milk  and the effects of oral absorption of small amounts of propofol are not known (see <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span></span>).<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Use of  DIPRIVAN has been associated with both fatal and life-threatening anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions.<br/></p><p>For general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation, DIPRIVAN should be administered only by persons trained in the administration of general anesthesia and not involved in the conduct of the surgical/diagnostic procedure. Sedated patients should be continuously monitored, and facilities for maintenance of a patent airway, providing artificial ventilation, administering supplemental oxygen, and instituting cardiovascular resuscitation must be immediately available. Patients should be continuously monitored for early signs of hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects are more likely to occur following rapid bolus administration, especially in the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients.<br/></p><p>For sedation of intubated, mechanically ventilated patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), DIPRIVAN should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management.<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Use of DIPRIVAN infusions for both adult and pediatric ICU sedation has been associated with a constellation of metabolic derangements and organ system failures, referred to as Propofol Infusion Syndrome, that have resulted in death. The syndrome is characterized by severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, lipemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, renal failure, ECG changes* and/or cardiac failure. The following appear to be major risk factors for the development of these events: decreased oxygen delivery to tissues; serious neurological injury and/or sepsis; high dosages of one or more of the following pharmacological agents: vasoconstrictors, steroids, inotropes and/or prolonged, high-dose infusions of propofol (greater than 5 mg/kg/h for greater than 48h). The syndrome has also been reported following large-dose, short-term infusions during surgical anesthesia.  In the setting of prolonged need for sedation, increasing propofol dose requirements to maintain a constant level of sedation, or onset of metabolic acidosis during administration of a propofol infusion, consideration should be given to using alternative means of sedation.<br/></span></p><p><span class="Italics">*Coved ST segment elevation (similar to ECG changes of the Brugada syndrome).</span><br/>
<br/>
Abrupt discontinuation of  DIPRIVAN prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. Infusions of  DIPRIVAN should be adjusted to maintain a light level of sedation through the weaning process or evaluation of sedation level (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).<br/></p><p>DIPRIVAN should not be coadministered through the same IV catheter with blood or plasma because compatibility has not been established. In vitro tests have shown that aggregates of the globular component of the emulsion vehicle have occurred with blood/plasma/serum from humans and animals. The clinical significance of these findings is not known.</p><p><span class="Italics">There have been reports in which failure to use aseptic technique when handling DIPRIVAN was associated with microbial contamination of the product and with fever, infection, sepsis, other life-threatening illness, and death. Do not use if contamination is suspected. Discard unused drug product as directed within the required time limits (see  <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Handling Procedures</span>).</span></p><p><span class="Italics">There have been reports, in the literature and other public sources, of the transmission of bloodborne pathogens (such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV) from unsafe injection practices, and use of propofol vials intended for single use on multiple persons. DIPRIVAN vial is never to be accessed more than once or used on more than one person.<br/></span><br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Neurotoxicity</span></span></p><p>Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy, <span class="Italics">Pediatric Use; ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY AND/OR PHARMACOLOGY</span></span>).<br/></p><p>Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.<br/></p><p>Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should<br/>
take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.<br/></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adult and Pediatric Patients<br/></span><br/>
A lower induction dose and a slower maintenance rate of administration should be used in elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)</span>. Patients should be continuously monitored for early signs of hypotension and/or bradycardia. Apnea requiring ventilatory support often occurs during induction and may persist for more than 60 seconds. DIPRIVAN use requires caution when administered to patients with disorders of lipid metabolism such as primary hyperlipoproteinemia, diabetic hyperlipemia, and pancreatitis.<br/></p><p>Very rarely the use of  DIPRIVAN may be associated with the development of a period of postoperative unconsciousness which may be accompanied by an increase in muscle tone. This may or may not be preceded by a brief period of wakefulness. Recovery is spontaneous.</p><p>When DIPRIVAN is administered to an epileptic patient, there is a risk of seizure during the recovery phase.</p><p>Attention should be paid to minimize pain on administration of  DIPRIVAN. Transient local pain can be minimized if the larger veins of the forearm or antecubital fossa are used.  Pain during intravenous injection may also be reduced by prior injection of IV lidocaine (1 mL of a 1% solution). Pain on injection occurred frequently in pediatric patients (45%) when a small vein of the hand was utilized without lidocaine pretreatment. With lidocaine pretreatment or when<br/>
antecubital veins were utilized, pain was minimal (incidence less than 10%) and well-tolerated. There have been reports in the literature indicating that the addition of lidocaine to DIPRIVAN in quantities greater than 20 mg lidocaine/200 mg DIPRIVAN results in instability of the emulsion which is associated with increases in globule sizes over time and (in rat studies) a reduction in anesthetic potency. Therefore, it is recommended that lidocaine be administered prior to DIPRIVAN administration or that it be added to DIPRIVAN immediately before administration and in quantities not exceeding 20 mg lidocaine/200 mg DIPRIVAN.<br/></p><p>Venous sequelae, i.e., phlebitis or thrombosis, have been reported rarely (less than 1%). In two clinical studies using dedicated intravenous catheters, no instances of venous sequelae were observed up to 14 days following induction.</p><p>Intra-arterial injection in animals did not induce local tissue effects. Accidental intra-arterial injection has been reported in patients, and, other than pain, there were no major sequelae.<br/></p><p>Intentional injection into subcutaneous or perivascular tissues of animals caused minimal tissue reaction. During the post-marketing period, there have been rare reports of local pain, swelling, blisters, and/or tissue necrosis following accidental extravasation of DIPRIVAN.<br/></p><p>Perioperative myoclonia, rarely including convulsions and opisthotonos, has occurred in association with DIPRIVAN administration.<br/></p><p>Clinical features of anaphylaxis, including angioedema, bronchospasm, erythema, and hypotension, occur rarely following DIPRIVAN administration.<br/></p><p>There have been rare reports of pulmonary edema in temporal relationship to the administration of DIPRIVAN, although a causal relationship is unknown.<br/></p><p>Rarely, cases of unexplained postoperative pancreatitis (requiring hospital admission) have been reported after anesthesia in which DIPRIVAN was one of the induction agents used. Due to a variety of confounding factors in these cases, including concomitant medications, a causal relationship to DIPRIVAN is unclear.</p><p>DIPRIVAN has no vagolytic activity. Reports of bradycardia, asystole, and rarely, cardiac arrest have been associated with DIPRIVAN. Pediatric patients are susceptible to this effect, particularly when fentanyl is given concomitantly. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., atropine or glycopyrrolate) should be considered to modify potential increases in vagal tone due to concomitant agents (e.g., succinylcholine) or surgical stimuli.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Intensive Care Unit Sedation</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, <span class="Italics">Handling Procedures</span>.)</span> The administration of  DIPRIVAN should be initiated as a continuous infusion and changes in the rate of administration made slowly (greater than 5 min) in order to minimize hypotension and avoid acute overdosage (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>Patients should be monitored for early signs of significant hypotension and/or cardiovascular depression, which may be profound. These effects are responsive to discontinuation of  DIPRIVAN, IV fluid administration, and/or vasopressor therapy. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus administration should not be used during sedation in order to minimize undesirable cardiorespiratory depression, including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation.</p><p>As with other sedative medications, there is wide interpatient variability in DIPRIVAN dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time.<br/></p><p>Failure to reduce the infusion rate in patients receiving DIPRIVAN for extended periods may result in excessively high blood concentrations of the drug. Thus, titration to clinical response and daily evaluation of sedation levels are important during use of DIPRIVAN infusion for ICU sedation, especially when it is used for long durations.<br/></p><p>Opioids and paralytic agents should be discontinued and respiratory function optimized prior to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation. Infusions of  DIPRIVAN should be adjusted to maintain a light level of sedation prior to weaning patients from mechanical ventilatory support. Throughout the weaning process, this level of sedation may be maintained in the absence of respiratory depression. Because of the rapid clearance of DIPRIVAN, abrupt discontinuation of a patient's infusion may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation, making weaning from mechanical ventilation difficult. It is therefore recommended that administration of DIPRIVAN be continued in order to maintain a light level of sedation throughout the weaning process until 10 minutes to 15 minutes prior to extubation, at which time the infusion can be discontinued.<br/></p><p>Since DIPRIVAN is formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion, elevations in serum triglycerides may occur when DIPRIVAN is administered for extended periods of time. Patients at risk of hyperlipidemia should be monitored for increases in serum triglycerides or serum turbidity. Administration of DIPRIVAN should be adjusted if fat is being inadequately cleared from the body. A reduction in the quantity of concurrently administered lipids is indicated to compensate for the amount of lipid infused as part of the DIPRIVAN formulation; 1 mL of  DIPRIVAN contains approximately 0.1 g of fat (1.1 kcal).<br/></p><p>EDTA is a strong chelator of trace metals â including zinc. Although with DIPRIVAN there are no reports of decreased zinc levels or zinc deficiency-related adverse events, DIPRIVAN should not be infused for longer than 5 days without providing a drug holiday to safely replace estimated or measured urine zinc losses.<br/></p><p>In clinical trials mean urinary zinc loss was approximately 2.5 mg/day to 3 mg/day in adult patients and 1.5 mg/day to 2 mg/day in pediatric patients.<br/></p><p>In patients who are predisposed to zinc deficiency, such as those with burns, diarrhea, and/or major sepsis, the need for supplemental zinc should be considered during prolonged therapy with DIPRIVAN.</p><p>At high doses (2 grams to 3 grams per day), EDTA has been reported, on rare occasions, to be toxic to the renal tubules. Studies to date in patients with normal or impaired renal function have not shown any alteration in renal function with DIPRIVAN containing 0.005% disodium edetate. In patients at risk for renal impairment, urinalysis and urine sediment should be checked before initiation of sedation and then be monitored on alternate days during sedation.<br/></p><p>The long-term administration of  DIPRIVAN to patients with renal failure and/or hepatic insufficiency has not been evaluated.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Neurosurgical Anesthesia</span></p><p>When DIPRIVAN is used in patients with increased intracranial pressure or impaired cerebral circulation, significant decreases in mean arterial pressure should be avoided because of the resultant decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure. To avoid significant hypotension and decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure, an infusion or slow bolus of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds should be utilized instead of rapid, more frequent, and/or larger boluses of DIPRIVAN. Slower induction, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg).

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, decreased pup survival concurrent with increased maternal mortality was observed with intravenous administration of propofol to pregnant rats either prior to mating and during early gestation or during late gestation and early lactation at exposures less than the human induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg. In pregnant rats administered 15 mg/kg/day intravenous propofol (equivalent to the human induction dose) from two weeks prior to mating to early in gestation (Gestation Day 7), offspring that were allowed to mate had increased postimplantation losses. The pharmacological activity (anesthesia) of the drug on the mother is probably responsible for the adverse effects seen in the offspring.<br/></p><p>Published studies in pregnant primates demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity during the period of peak brain development increases neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring when used for longer than 3 hours. There are no data on pregnancy exposures in primates corresponding to periods prior to the third trimester in humans [See Data].<br/></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.<br/>

Pregnant rats were administered propofol intravenously at 0, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day (0.3, 0.65, and 1 times the human induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg based on body surface area) during organogenesis (Gestational Days 6-15). Propofol did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at exposures up to 1 times the human induction dose despite evidence of maternal toxicity (decreased weight gain in all groups).<br/></p><p>Pregnant rabbits were administered propofol intravenously at 0, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day (0.65, 1.3, 2 times the human induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg based on body surface area comparison) during organogenesis (Gestation Days 6-18). Propofol treatment decreased total numbers of corpora lutea in all treatment groups but did not cause fetal malformations at any dose despite maternal toxicity (one maternal death from anesthesia-related respiratory depression in the high dose group).<br/></p><p>Pregnant rats were administered propofol intravenously at 0, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day (0.65 and 1 times the human induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg based on body surface area) from late gestation through lactation (Gestation Day 16 to Lactation Day 22). Decreased pup survival was noted at all doses in the presence of maternal toxicity (deaths from anesthesia-induced respiratory depression). This study did not evaluate neurobehavioral function including learning and memory in the pups.<br/></p><p>Pregnant rats were administered propofol intravenously at 0, 10, or 15 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 1 times the human induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg based on body surface area) from 2 weeks prior to mating to Gestational Day 7. Pup (F1) survival was decreased on Day 15 and 22 of lactation at maternally toxic doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg/day. When F1 offspring were allowed to mate, postimplantation losses were increased in the 15 mg/kg/day treatment group.</p><p>In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus. In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring. With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear; however, studies in juvenile animals suggest neuroapoptosis correlates with long-term cognitive deficits (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS; <span class="Italics">Pediatric Neurotoxicity</span>, PRECAUTIONS; <span class="Italics">Pediatric Use</span>, and ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY AND/OR PHARMACOLOGY).<br/></span><br/>

While causality has not been established, DIPRIVAN is not indicated for sedation in pediatric patients until further studies have been performed to document its safety in that population (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>, <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics</span></span>, <span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).<br/></p><p>In pediatric patients, abrupt discontinuation of DIPRIVAN following prolonged infusion may result in flushing of the hands and feet, agitation, tremulousness and hyperirritability. Increased incidences of bradycardia (5%), agitation (4%), and jitteriness (9%) have also been observed. Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as DIPRIVAN, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.<br/></p><p>In primates, exposure to 3 hours of ketamine that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer of isoflurane increased neuronal cell loss.

The effect of age on induction dose requirements for propofol was assessed in an open-label study involving 211 unpremedicated patients with approximately 30 patients in each decade between the ages of 16 and 80. The average dose to induce anesthesia was calculated for patients up to 54 years<br/>
of age and for patients 55 years of age or older. The average dose to induce anesthesia in patients up to 54 years of age was 1.99 mg/kg and in patients above 54 it was 1.66 mg/kg. Subsequent clinical studies have demonstrated lower dosing requirements for subjects greater than 60 years of age.<br/></p><p>A lower induction dose and a slower maintenance rate of administration of DIPRIVAN should be used in elderly patients. In this group of patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus administration should not be used in order to minimize undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation.

Instances of self-administration of DIPRIVAN by health care professionals have also been reported, which have resulted in fatalities and other injuries. Inventories of DIPRIVAN should be stored and managed to prevent the risk of diversion, including restriction of access and accounting procedures as appropriate to the clinical setting. </p><p class="First"><br/></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">If overdosage occurs,  DIPRIVAN Injectable Emulsion  administration  should  be  discontinued immediately.  Overdosage is likely  to cause cardiorespiratory depression. Respiratory depression should  be treated by artificial  ventilation  with  oxygen. Cardiovascular depression may require repositioning of the patient by raising the patientâs legs, increasing the flow rate of intravenous fluids, and administering pressor agents and/or anticholinergic agents.</p><h2>Anesthesia S/I-40 Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Propofol blood concentrations at steady-state are generally proportional to infusion rates, especially in individual patients. Undesirable effects such as cardiorespiratory depression are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in the infusion rate. An adequate interval (3 minutes to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to allow for and assess the clinical effects.<br/></p><p>Shake well before use. Do not use if there is evidence of excessive creaming or aggregation, if large droplets are visible, or if there are other forms of phase separation indicating that the stability of the product has been compromised. Slight creaming, which should disappear after shaking, may be visible upon prolonged standing.<br/></p><p>When administering DIPRIVAN by infusion, syringe or volumetric pumps are recommended to provide controlled infusion rates. When infusing DIPRIVAN to patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging, metered control devices may be utilized if mechanical pumps are impractical.<br/></p><p>Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and/or by increasing the infusion rate of DIPRIVAN.<br/></p><p>For minor surgical procedures (e.g., body surface) nitrous oxide (60% to 70%) can be combined with a variable rate DIPRIVAN infusion to provide satisfactory anesthesia. With more stimulating surgical procedures (e.g., intra-abdominal), or if supplementation with nitrous oxide is not provided, administration rate(s) of DIPRIVAN and/or opioids should be increased in order to provide adequate anesthesia.<br/></p><p>Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light anesthesia until a mild response to surgical stimulation is obtained in order to avoid administration of DIPRIVAN at rates higher than are clinically necessary. Generally, rates of 50 mcg/kg/min to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times.<br/></p><p>Other drugs that cause CNS depression (e.g., sedatives, anesthetics, and opioids) can increase CNS depression induced by propofol. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injection maintenance infusion rate and<br/>

For induction, DIPRIVAN should be titrated (approximately 40 mg every 10 seconds) against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia. As with other general anesthetics, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients</span><br/></p><p>It is important to be familiar and experienced with the intravenous use of DIPRIVAN before treating elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients. Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most of these patients require approximately 1 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg (approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds) of DIPRIVAN for induction of anesthesia according to their condition and responses. A rapid bolus should not be used, as this will increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span><br/></p><p>Most patients aged 3 years through 16 years and classified ASA-PS I or II require 2.5 mg/kg to 3.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN for induction when unpremedicated or when lightly premedicated with oral benzodiazepines or intramuscular opioids. Within this dosage range, younger pediatric patients may require higher induction doses than older pediatric patients. As with other general anesthetics, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication will influence the response of the patient to an induction dose of DIPRIVAN. A lower dosage is recommended for pediatric patients classified as ASA-PS III or IV. Attention should be paid to minimize pain on injection when administering DIPRIVAN to pediatric patients. Boluses of DIPRIVAN may be administered via small veins if pretreated with lidocaine or via antecubital or larger veins (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, General</span>).<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Neurosurgical Patients</span><br/></p><p>Slower induction is recommended using boluses of 20 mg every 10 seconds. Slower boluses or infusions of DIPRIVAN for induction of anesthesia, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg) (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Anesthesia</span><br/></p><p>DIPRIVAN has been well-studied in patients with coronary artery disease, but experience in patients with hemodynamically significant valvular or congenital heart disease is limited. As with other general anesthetics and sedation drugs, DIPRIVAN in healthy patients causes a decrease in blood pressure that  is secondary to decreases in preload (ventricular filling volume at the end of the diastole) and afterload (arterial resistance at the beginning of the systole). The magnitude of these changes is proportional to  the blood and effect site concentrations achieved. These concentrations depend upon the dose and speed of the induction and maintenance infusion rates.<br/></p><p>In addition, lower heart rates are observed during maintenance with DIPRIVAN, possibly due to reduction of the sympathetic activity and/or resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes. Therefore, anticholinergic agents should be administered when increases in vagal tone are anticipated.<br/></p><p>As with other anesthetic agents, DIPRIVAN reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Further studies are needed to confirm and delineate the extent of these effects on the myocardium and the coronary vascular system.<br/></p><p>Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary DIPRIVAN maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. The rate of DIPRIVAN administration should be determined based on the patient's premedication and adjusted according to clinical responses.<br/></p><p>A rapid bolus induction should be avoided. A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg) should be used. In order to assure adequate anesthesia, when DIPRIVAN is used as the primary agent, maintenance infusion rates should not be less than 100 mcg/kg/min and should be supplemented with analgesic levels of continuous opioid administration.When an opioid is used as the primary agent, DIPRIVAN maintenance rates should not be less than 50 mcg/kg/min, and care should be taken to ensure amnesia. Higher doses of DIPRIVAN will reduce the opioid requirements (see Table 4). When DIPRIVAN is used as the primary anesthetic, it should not be administered with the high-dose opioid technique as this may increase the likelihood of hypotension (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, <span class="Italics">Cardiac Anesthesia</span></span>).<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4.

The incremental boluses should be administered when changes in vital signs indicate a response to surgical stimulation or light anesthesia. <span class="Bold"><br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>DIPRIVAN administered as a variable rate infusion supplemented with nitrous oxide 60% to 70% provides satisfactory anesthesia for most children 2 months of age or older, ASA-PS I or II, undergoing general anesthesia.<br/></p><p>In general, for the pediatric population, maintenance by infusion of  DIPRIVAN at a rate of 200 mcg/kg/min to 300 mcg/kg/min should immediately follow the induction dose. Following the first half- hour of maintenance, infusion rates of 125 mcg/kg/min to 150 mcg/kg/min are typically needed. DIPRIVAN should be titrated to achieve the desired clinical effect. Younger pediatric patients may require higher maintenance infusion rates than older pediatric patients. (See Table 2 Clinical Trials.)<br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Monitored Anesthesia Care</span></span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">(MAC) Sedation</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span></p><p>When DIPRIVAN is administered for MAC sedation, rates of administration should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. In most patients, the rates of DIPRIVAN administration will be in the range of 25 mcg/kg/min to 75 mcg/kg/min.<br/></p><p>During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus dose administration. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). A rapid bolus injection can result in undesirable cardiorespiratory depression including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and oxygen desaturation.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Initiation of MAC Sedation</span></p><p>For initiation of MAC sedation, either an infusion or a slow injection method may be utilized while closely monitoring cardiorespiratory function. With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing DIPRIVAN at 100 mcg/kg/min to 150 mcg/kg/min (6 mg/kg/h to 9 mg/kg/h) for a period of 3 minutes to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function. With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg/kg administered over 3 minutes to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses. When DIPRIVAN is administered slowly over 3 minutes to 5 minutes, most patients will be adequately sedated, and the peak drug effect can be achieved while minimizing undesirable cardiorespiratory effects occurring at high plasma levels.<br/></p><p>In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). The rate of administration should be over 3 minutes to 5 minutes and the dosage of DIPRIVAN should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Maintenance of MAC Sedation</span></p><p>For maintenance of sedation, a variable rate infusion method is preferable over an intermittent bolus dose method. With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates  of 25 mcg/kg/min to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 mg/kg/h to 4.5 mg/kg/h) during the first 10 minutes to 15 minutes of sedation maintenance. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min and adjusted to clinical responses. In titrating to clinical effect, allow approximately 2 minutes for onset of peak drug effect.</p><p>Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light sedation until mild responses to stimulation are obtained in order to avoid sedative administration of DIPRIVAN at rates higher than are clinically necessary.<br/></p><p>If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of DIPRIVAN 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect. With the intermittent bolus method of sedation maintenance, there is increased potential for respiratory depression, transient increases in sedation depth, and prolongation of recovery.</p><p>In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). The rate of administration and the dosage of DIPRIVAN should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).<br/></p><p>DIPRIVAN can be administered as the sole agent for maintenance of MAC sedation during surgical/diagnostic procedures. When DIPRIVAN sedation is supplemented with opioid and/or benzodiazepine medications, these agents increase the sedative and respiratory effects of DIPRIVAN and may also result in a slower recovery profile (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">ICU Sedation</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, <span class="Italics">Handling Procedures</span>.)</span></p><p>Abrupt discontinuation of DIPRIVAN prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. Infusions of DIPRIVAN should be adjusted to assure a minimal level of sedation is maintained throughout the weaning process and when assessing the level of sedation (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span></p><p>For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).<br/></p><p>Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h to 3 mg/kg/h) individualized and  titrated to clinical response (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).<br/></p><p>Dosage and rate of administration should be individualized and titrated to the desired effect, according to clinically relevant factors including the patientâs underlying medical problems, preinduction and concomitant medications, age, ASA-PS classification, and level of debilitation of the patient. The elderly, debilitated, and ASA-PS III or IV patients may have exaggerated hemodynamic and respiratory responses to rapid bolus doses (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).<br/></p><p>DIPRIVAN should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Intensive Care Unit Sedation</span></span>). For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 mcg/kg/min to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h to 0.6 mg/kg/h) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5 minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect.  Most adult patients require<br/>
maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/h to 3 mg/kg/h) or higher. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). Dosages of DIPRIVAN should be reduced in patients who have received large dosages of narcotics. The DIPRIVAN dosage requirement may also  be reduced by adequate management of pain with analgesic agents. As with other sedative medications, there is interpatient variability in dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time (see <span class="Bold">SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDELINES</span>). Evaluation of level of sedation and assessment of CNS function should be carried out daily throughout maintenance to determine the minimum dose of DIPRIVAN required for sedation (see Clinical Trials, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Sedation). Bolus administration of 10 mg or 20 mg should only be used to rapidly increase depth of sedation in patients where hypotension is not likely to occur. Patients with compromised myocardial function, intravascular volume depletion, or abnormally low vascular tone (e.g., sepsis) may be more susceptible to hypotension (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).<br/></p><h2>SUMMARY OF DOSAGE GUIDELINES</h2><p class="First">Dosages and rates of administration in the following table should be individualized and titrated to clinical response.
