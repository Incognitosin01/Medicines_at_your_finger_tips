It belongs to the group of medicines called central nervous system (CNS) depressants, which slows down the nervous system. Zolpidem will help you get to sleep faster and sleep throughout the night. In most cases, sleep medicines should only be used for short periods of time, such as 1 or 2 days, and for no longer than 1 or 2 weeks.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Ambien CR</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
