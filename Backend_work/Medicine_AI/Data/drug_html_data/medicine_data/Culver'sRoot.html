Whorled leaves (from 4 to 7) terminate in spikes of white flowers approximately 8 to 25 cm long, which bloom in July through August. The purple flower variety is termed Leptandra purpurea. Native to North America, but growing elsewhere, black culver's root prefers meadows and rich woodlands. The medicinal parts of the plant include the dried rhizome with the roots.Dwyer 1986 This plant was assigned by Linnaeus to the genus Veronica, but later was put in genus Leptandra by Nuttall, which is now used by present-day botanists. A revision of the genus is needed.Dwyer 1986, Hocking 1997 Synonyms are V. sibiricum L. Pennell, V. sibirica L., Leptandra virginica (Nutt.).</p><h2>History</h2><p>The first documented use of culver's root was when Puritan leader Cotton Mather requested it as a remedy for his daughter's tuberculosis in 1716. Culver's root was used by early physicians as a powerful laxative and emetic. Native American tribes also used the plant and drank tea preparations to induce vomiting and to help cleanse the blood. Herbalists have used culver's root for its ability to increase the flow of bile from the liver.Dwyer 1986</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Chemical analysis studies report constituents from genus Veronicastrum and VeronicaSwiatek 1968 and the presence of aucubin from Veronica species.Shimada 1971 Culver's root is known to contain volatile oil, cinnamic acid derivatives (such as 4-methoxy cinnamic acid, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid and their esters), tannins, and bitter principle leptandrin.Hocking 1997 Asian studies involving Veronicastrum sibiricum list the constituents mannitol, resin, gum, phytosterols, glycoside, and saponins as also being present in the plants.Lee 1987, Lin 1995, Zhou 1992, Zhou 1992</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Black culver's root has been used for years as a liver tonic, for liver or gallbladder disorders, and to promote bile flow.
