</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ropinirole Extended Release Tablets</h2><p class="First">Ropinirole extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.</p><h2>Ropinirole Extended Release Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Recommendations</h3><p class="First"> ·        Ropinirole extended-release tablets are taken once daily, with or without food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>·        Tablets must be swallowed whole and must not be chewed, crushed, or divided.</p><p>·        If a significant interruption in therapy with ropinirole extended-release tablets has occurred, retitration of therapy may be warranted.</p><h3>Dosing for Parkinson's Disease</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets is 2 mg taken once daily for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by increases of 2 mg/day at weekly or longer intervals, based on therapeutic response and tolerability.  Monitor patients at least weekly during dose titration. Too rapid a rate of titration may lead to the selection of a dose that does not provide additional benefit, but increases the risk of adverse reactions.  </p><p>In fixed-dose studies designed to characterize the dose-response to ropinirole extended-release tablets, there was no additional therapeutic benefit shown in patients with advanced stage Parkinson’s disease taking daily doses greater than 8 mg/day, or with early stage Parkinson’s disease taking doses greater than 12 mg/day <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1 and 14.2)]</span>. Although the maximum recommended dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets is 24 mg, patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease should generally be maintained at daily doses of 8 mg or lower and patients with early Parkinson’s disease should generally be maintained at daily doses 12 mg or lower.</p><p>Ropinirole extended-release tablets should be discontinued gradually over a 7-day period. </p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 mL/min). The recommended initial dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets for patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis is 2 mg once daily. Further dose escalations should be based on tolerability and need for efficacy. The recommended maximum total daily dose is 18 mg/day in patients receiving regular dialysis. Supplemental doses after dialysis are not required. The use of ropinirole extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment without regular dialysis has not been studied. </p><h3>Switching from Immediate-Release Ropinirole Tablets to Extended-Release Ropinirole Tablets</h3><p class="First">Patients may be switched directly from immediate-release ropinirole to extended-release ropinirole tablets. The initial dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets should approximately match the total daily dose of the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole, as shown in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1. Conversion from Immediate-Release Ropinirole Tablets to Extended-Release Ropinirole Tablets<br/></span></p><p>Following conversion to ropinirole extended-release tablets, the dose may be adjusted depending on therapeutic response and tolerability <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].<br/></span></p><h3>Effect of Gastrointestinal Transit Time on Medication Release</h3><p class="First">Ropinirole extended-release tablets are designed to release medication over a 24-hour period. If rapid gastrointestinal transit occurs, there may be risk of incomplete release of medication and medication residue being passed in the stool.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"> Ropinirole extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients known to have a hypersensitivity/allergic reaction including urticaria, angioedema, rash, pruritus) to ropinirole or any of the excipients.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence</h3><p class="First">Patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment.</p><p>Among the 613 patients who received ropinirole extended-release tablets in flexible-dose clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 3), &lt;1% of patients reported sudden onset of sleep and &lt;1% of patients reported a motor vehicle accident in which it is not known if falling asleep was a contributing factor.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled fixed-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 2), sudden onset of sleep was reported in 4% of 276 patients on ropinirole extended-release tabletscompared with 3% of 74 patients on placebo. In a placebo-controlled fixed-dose trial in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (Study 4), sudden onset of sleep was reported in 5% of 146 patients on ropinirole extended-release tabletscompared with 0% of 40 patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The incidence of sudden onset of sleep was not dose-related in either trial. </p><p>During a placebo-controlled flexible-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 1), somnolence was reported in 7% of 202 patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 4% of 191 patients on placebo. During a flexible-dose, active-control, crossover trial in early Parkinson’s disease (Study 3), somnolence was reported in 11% of 140 patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 15% of 149 patients on an immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets<span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> </p><p>In a placebo-controlled fixed-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 2), somnolence was reported in 8% of 276 patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 5% of 74 patients on placebo. In a placebo-controlled fixed-dose trial in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (Study 4), somnolence was reported in 10% of 146 patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 5% of 40 patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The frequency of reported somnolence was not dose-related. </p><p>It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.</p><p>Before initiating treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole extended-release tablets such as concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders, and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole extended-release tablets should ordinarily be discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living.</p><h3>Syncope</h3><p class="First">Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets in patients with Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled flexible-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 1), syncope occurred in 1% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 0% of patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In the placebo-controlled fixed-dose trials (Study 2 and Study 4), one patient on ropinirole extended-release tablets with advanced Parkinson's disease and one patient on ropinirole extended-release tablets with early Parkinson's disease experienced syncope during the titration period for ropinirole extended-release tablets. Both patients discontinued prematurely from the respective trials. </p><p>Because the trials conducted with ropinirole extended-release tablets excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution.</p><h3>Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Patients with Parkinson’s disease may have impaired ability to respond normally to a fall in blood pressure after standing from lying down or seated position. Patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>In a placebo-controlled flexible-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 1), hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets, compared with 0% of patients on placebo. In this study, orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction in 5% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets, and 1% of patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Some patients experienced hypotension or orthostatic hypotension that started in the titration and persisted into the maintenance period. There was also a higher incidence for the combined adverse reaction terms of “hypotension”, “orthostatic hypotension”, “dizziness”, “vertigo”, and “blood pressure decreased” in 7% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 3% of patients on placebo. The increased incidence of those events with ropinirole extended-release tablets was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this trial. The frequency of orthostatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure decrements ≥20 mm Hg) at any time during the trial was 38% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 31% for placebo.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled fixed-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 2), a decrease in standing systolic blood pressure of ≥20 mm Hg was observed in 26% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 18% of patients on placebo.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled fixed-dose trial of patients with early Parkinson's disease (Study 4), a decrease in standing systolic blood pressure of ≥20 mm Hg was observed in 14% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 10% of patients on placebo.</p><p>Significant decrements in blood pressure unrelated to standing were also reported in some patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. </p><h3>Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate</h3><p class="First">The potential for elevation in blood pressure and changes in heart rate should be considered when treating patients with cardiovascular disease with ropinirole extended-release tablets.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled flexible-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 1), the frequency of systolic blood pressure increase (≥40mm Hg) in the semi-supine position was 8% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 5% of patients on placebo. In the standing position, the frequency of systolic blood pressure increase (≥40 mm Hg) was 9% for ropinirole extended-release tablets vs. 6% for placebo. There was no clear effect of ropinirole extended-release tablets on average heart rate.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled fixed-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 2), hypertension was reported as an adverse reaction in 3% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets, compared with 1% of patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial in patients with early Parkinson’s disease (Study 4), hypertension was reported as an adverse reaction in 5% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets, compared with 0% of patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior</h3><p class="First">In a placebo-controlled flexible-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 1), 8% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets reported hallucination, compared with 2% of patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Hallucinations led to discontinuation of treatment in 2% of patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets and 1% of patients on placebo. The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled fixed-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 2), the incidence of hallucination was 3% in patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 0% in patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The most common adverse reaction associated with study discontinuation for any dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets was hallucination (2%).</p><p>Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.</p><p>Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole extended-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First">Ropinirole extended-release tablets may cause or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled flexible-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 1) the incidence of dyskinesia was 13% in patients on ropinirole extended-release tabletsand 3%  in patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In a placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (Study 2), the incidence of dyskinesia was 7% in patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets compared with 1% in patients on placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Decreasing the dose of dopaminergic medications may ameliorate this adverse reaction. </p><h3>Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors</h3><p class="First">Reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole extended-release tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole extended-release tablets.</p><h3>Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion</h3><p class="First">A symptom complex resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction of, withdrawal of, or changes in, dopaminergic therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that the dose be tapered at the end of treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets as a prophylactic measure <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Melanoma</h3><p class="First">Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson’s disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson’s disease, is unclear. In the clinical development program (N = 613), 1 patient treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets and also levodopa/carbidopa developed melanoma.</p><p>For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using ropinirole extended-release tablets. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). </p><h3>Fibrotic Complications</h3><p class="First">Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur.</p><p>Although these adverse reactions are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as ropinirole, can cause them is unknown.</p><p>Cases of possible fibrotic complications, including pleural effusion, pleural fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in the development program and postmarketing experience for ropinirole. In the clinical development program (N = 613), 2 patients treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets had pleural effusion. While the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between ropinirole and these fibrotic complications, a contribution of ropinirole cannot be excluded.</p><h3>Retinal Pathology</h3><p class="First">Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested. The lowest dose tested (1.5 mg/kg/day) is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 24 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding).</p><p>Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible-dose, L-dopa-controlled clinical trial of immediate-release ropinirole in patients with Parkinson’s disease; 156 patients (78 on immediate-release ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial.</p><h3>Binding to Melanin</h3><p class="First">Ropinirole binds to melanin-containing tissues (e.g., eyes, skin) in pigmented rats. After a single dose, long-term retention of drug was demonstrated, with a half-life in the eye of 20 days.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"> The following adverse reactions are described in more detail in other sections of the label: </p><p>·       Hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span> </p><p>·       Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> </p><p>·       Syncope <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> </p><p>·       Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> </p><p>·       Elevation of Blood Pressure and Changes in Heart Rate <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span> </p><p>·       Hallucinations/Psychotic-like Behavior <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span> </p><p>·       Dyskinesia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span> </p><p>·       Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span> </p><p>·       Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span> </p><p>·       Melanoma <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] </span> </p><p>·       Fibrotic Complications <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]<br/></span> •           Retinal Pathology <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span> </p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>During the premarketing development of ropinirole extended-release tablets, patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease received ropinirole extended-release tablets or placebo as adjunctive therapy with L-dopa in a flexible-dose clinical trial. In a flexible-dose trial, patients with early Parkinson’s disease were treated with ropinirole extended-release tablets or the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets without L-dopa. In addition, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, postmarketing trials evaluated the dose response of ropinirole extended-release tablets in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease taking L-dopa and in patients with early Parkinson’s disease without concomitant L-dopa. </p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Advanced Parkinson’s Disease (with L-dopa)</span></p><p>Study 1 was a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose trial in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease.

There is thus the potential for inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme to alter the clearance of ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole extended-release tablets, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets may be required. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, with immediate-release ropinirole increases the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of ropinirole <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Cigarette smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Estrogens</h3><p class="First">Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that higher doses of estrogens (usually associated with hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) reduced the clearance of ropinirole.

Eligible patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to 4 treatment sequences (2 were titrated on immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets and 2 on ropinirole extended-release tablets). Titration rate of immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets was slower than that of the ropinirole extended-release tablets. Patients were titrated during the 12-week titration period to their optimal dosage, based upon tolerance and therapeutic response. This was followed by 3 consecutive 8-week maintenance periods, during which patients were either maintained on the prior formulation or switched to the alternative formulation. All switches were performed overnight by using the approximately equivalent doses of ropinirole. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change of UPDRS motor score within each maintenance period.</p><p>Patients in all 4 groups started out with similar UPDRS motor scores (about 21) at baseline. All groups exhibited similar improvement in UPDRS total motor scores from baseline until the completion of the titration phase, with a change in score of about -9 observed for the groups started on immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets and of about -10 for the groups started on ropinirole extended-release tablets. No difference was observed between groups when switches were made between identical formulations or between different formulations. This suggests therapeutic dosage equivalence between the immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets and ropinirole extended-release tablets.</p><p>The optimal daily dose at the end of the titration period for patients on immediate-release formulation of ropinirole tablets was substantially lower (mean: 7 mg) compared with the dose at the end of the titration period for patients on ropinirole extended-release tablets (mean: 18 mg). In this trial, the marked difference in the final optimal dosages suggests that the higher doses afforded no additional benefit when compared with the lower doses <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Study 4 (Fixed-Dose, Dose-Response Trial)</span></p><p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, parallel-group trial evaluated the dose response of ropinirole extended-release tablets without L-dopa in 186 randomized patients with early Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stages I-III) over a total dosing period of 18 weeks. Patients initiated treatment with placebo or ropinirole extended-release tablets at 2 mg/day for 1 week and were either maintained at a target dose of 2 mg/day or further increased to a target dose of 4 mg/day, 8 mg/day, 12 mg/day, or 24 mg/day over a 13-week up-titration period. The dose remained stable over an additional 4week maintenance period, followed by a 1-week down-titration period. The primary statistical analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM).</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in UPDRS motor score at Week 4 of the maintenance period with daily doses of 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, and 24 mg compared with placebo. At baseline, the mean UPDRS motor score ranged from approximately 21 to 25 across all groups receiving ropinirole extended-release tablets and placebo. Table 7 shows results for the primary efficacy endpoint. The greatest treatment difference (Ropinirole Extended-Release Tablets – PLACEBO) for the primary efficacy endpoint occurred with the 12-mg dose. At Week 4 of the maintenance period, the primary efficacy analysis (MMRM) did not show a significant difference between placebo (mean adjusted change: -3.98) and any dose of ropinirole extended-release tablets (mean adjusted changes ranged from -4.09 to -6.14). Data were also analyzed by nonparametric ANCOVA as pre-specified because of non-normality.

Extended-Release Tablets</span></p><p><span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about ropinirole extended-release tablets?<br/></span> Ropinirole extended-release tablets can cause serious side effects including:<br/>
• <span class="Bold">Falling asleep during normal activities.</span> You may fall asleep while doing normal activities such as driving a car, doing physical tasks, or using hazardous machinery while taking ropinirole extended-release tablets. You may suddenly fall asleep without being drowsy or without warning. This may result in having accidents. Your chances of falling asleep while doing normal activities while taking ropinirole extended-release tablets are greater if you take other medicines that cause drowsiness. Tell your healthcare provider right away if this happens. Before starting ropinirole extended-release tablets, be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you take any medicines that make you drowsy.<br/>
•<span class="Bold"> Fainting.</span> Fainting can happen, and sometimes your heart rate may be decreased. This can happen especially when you start taking ropinirole extended-release tablets or your dose is increased. Tell your healthcare provider if you faint, feel dizzy or feel light-headed.<br/>
• <span class="Bold">Decrease in blood pressure.</span> Ropinirole extended-release tablets can decrease your blood pressure (hypotension),  especially when you start taking ropinirole extended-release tablets or when your dose is changed. If you faint or feel dizzy, nauseated, or sweaty when you stand up from sitting or lying down (orthostatic hypotension), this may mean that your blood pressure is decreased. When you change position from lying down or sitting to standing up, you should do it carefully and slowly. Call your healthcare provider if you have any of the symptoms of decreased blood pressure listed above.<br/>
•<span class="Bold"> Increase in blood pressure.</span> Ropinirole extended-release tablets may increase your blood pressure.<br/>
• <span class="Bold">Changes in heart rate (decrease or increase).</span> Ropinirole extended-release tablets can decrease or increase your heart rate.<br/>
• <span class="Bold">Hallucinations and other psychotic-like behavior.</span> Ropinirole extended-release tablets can cause or worsen psychotic-like behavior including hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real), confusion, excessive suspicion, aggressive behavior, agitation, delusional beliefs (believing things that are not real), and disorganized thinking. The chances of having hallucinations or these other psychotic-like changes are higher in people with Parkinson’s disease who are taking ropinirole extended-release tablets or taking higher doses of these drugs. If you have hallucinations or any of these other psychotic-like changes, talk with your healthcare provider. <br/>
•<span class="Bold">Uncontrolled sudden movements</span>. Ropinirole extended-release tablets may cause uncontrolled sudden movements or make such movements you already have worse or more frequent. Tell your healthcare provider if this happens. The doses of your anti-Parkinson’s medicines may need to be changed.<br/>
•<span class="Bold">Unusual urges.</span> Some patients taking ropinirole extended-release tablets get urges to behave in a way unusual for them. Examples of this are an unusual urge to gamble, increased sexual urges and behaviors, or an uncontrollable urge to shop, spend money, or eat. If you notice or your family notices that you are developing any unusual behaviors, talk to your healthcare provider.<br/>
• <span class="Bold">Increased chance of skin cancer (melanoma).</span> People with Parkinson’s disease may have a higher chance of getting melanoma. It is not known if ropinirole extended-release tablets increase your chances of getting melanoma. You and your healthcare provider should check your skin on a regular basis. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you notice any changes in your skin such as a change in the size, shape, or color of moles on your skin.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are ropinirole extended-release tablets?<br/></span> Ropinirole extended-release tablets are long-acting prescription medicine containing ropinirole (taken 1 time a day) that is used only to treat Parkinson’s disease but not to treat Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).<br/>
