It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce the number and severity of seizures. However, lacosamide cannot cure epilepsy and will only work to control seizures for as long as you continue to take it.</p><p>Lacosamide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using lacosamide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For lacosamide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to lacosamide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of lacosamide in children younger than 4 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lacosamide in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving lacosamide.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking lacosamide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using lacosamide with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of lacosamide</h2><p><i>Take lacosamide only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>Lacosamide should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>You may take lacosamide with or without food.</p><p>Swallow the <i>tablet</i> whole with liquid.

Keep using all of your medicines unless your doctor tells you to stop.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of lacosamide will be different for different patients.
