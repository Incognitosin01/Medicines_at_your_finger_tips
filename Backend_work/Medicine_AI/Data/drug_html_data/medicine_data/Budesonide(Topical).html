Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Enema [Canadian product]: Remove nozzle and protective cap from enema bottle; place one dispersible tablet into enema bottle. Place nozzle back on the bottle, ensure protective cap is secured, then shake bottle vigorously for at least 10 seconds or until tablet is completely dissolved (suspension should turn slightly yellowish). Volume of reconstituted enema is 115 mL.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Rectal: Rectal foam: For rectal use only; not for oral use. Wash hands before and after use. Prior to use, patients should use the bathroom to empty the bowel; when administering evening dose (immediately prior to bedtime), do not empty bowels again until the next morning if possible. Attach applicator to canister nozzle. Each applicator is coated with a lubricant. If additional lubrication is needed, petrolatum or petroleum jelly can also be used. Warm the canister in the hands while shaking it vigorously for 10 to 15 seconds prior to use. Unlock the canister by twisting the domed canister top until it is aligned with the nozzle. May be used in a standing, lying or sitting position (eg, while sitting on the toilet). Turn the canister upside down and gently insert applicator tip into rectum as far as is comfortable. Push down on the pump dome with forefinger and hold for 2 seconds; release finger pressure on pump dome and hold applicator in place for 10 to 15 seconds. After administering, applicators can only be used one time and should be discarded in provided plastic trash bag. Avoid fire, flame and smoking during and immediately following administration. Temporarily discontinue use before initiation of bowel preparation for colonoscopy; consult provider prior to resuming therapy.</p><p>Rectal enema [Canadian product]: For rectal use only; not for oral use. Patient should lie down on left side, shake the reconstituted enema bottle, remove protective cap and then empty contents into rectum. Patient should roll over on stomach and remain in this position for 5 minutes, then lie in a comfortable position. Enema should be retained the whole night if possible or as long as possible.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Avoid consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice during treatment </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).

Use immediately after preparation.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Moderate): May increase the serum concentration of Budesonide (Topical).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong): May increase the serum concentration of Budesonide (Topical).<i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified. Frequency not always defined.</p><p>&gt;10%: Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Decreased plasma cortisol (17%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Adrenocortical insufficiency (4%), hpa-axis suppression, hypercortisolism</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Nausea (2%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Acne vulgaris, adrenal cortex hypofunction, agitation, allergic dermatitis, anaphylaxis, anxiety, depression, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, dysphoria, emotional lability, exacerbation of diabetes mellitus, fever, flatulence, hyperacidity (peptic ulcer), hyperglycemia, hypertension, insomnia, maculopapular rash, pancreatitis, peripheral edema, pruritus, pseudotumor cerebri, skin rash, sleep disorder, urticaria</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods, or with concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitor use. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. In situations where patients are subject to surgery or other stress situations, supplementation with systemic glucocorticoids is recommended.</p><p>• Impaired adrenal suppression in patients transferred from other glucocorticoids: Monitor patients transferred from systemic corticosteroids to corticosteroids with lower systemic effects (eg rectal foam), since steroid withdrawal, including benign intracranial hypertension or acute adrenal suppression, may occur. Replacement of systemic corticosteroids with rectal foam may unmask allergies (eg, rhinitis and eczema) previously controlled by systemic drug. Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these patients; reduce dose cautiously.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may also increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Exposure to chickenpox should be avoided; if exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be needed; antivirals may be needed if chickenpox develops. Exposure to measles may require pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin use. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat ocular herpes simplex. Corticosteroids should not be used for viral hepatitis. Close observation is required in patients with latent tuberculosis and/or TB reactivity; restrict use in active TB (only in conjunction with antituberculosis treatment).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with hypertension, acute coronary disease, or limited cardiac reserve.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes or a family history of diabetes; may alter glucose production/regulation leading to hyperglycemia.</p><p>• Gastrointestinal disease: Use with caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease. Use budesonide enema [Canadian product] with caution in patients with diverticulitis or severe ulcerative colitis (perforation risk).</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, including cirrhosis; increased oral bioavailability has been reported in patients with cirrhosis.</p><p>• Myasthenia gravis: Use with caution; exacerbation of symptoms has occurred especially during initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids.</p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma or a family history of these diseases; increased intraocular pressure, open-angle glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged glucocorticoid use.</p><p>• Osteoporosis: Use with caution in patients with osteoporosis; high doses and/or long-term use of corticosteroids have been associated with increased bone loss and osteoporotic fractures.</p><p>• Psychiatric disturbances: Systemic corticosteroid use may cause psychiatric disturbances, including depression, euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, and personality changes. Preexisting psychiatric conditions may be exacerbated by corticosteroid use.</p><p>• Thyroid disease: Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids increases in hyperthyroid patients and decreases in hypothyroid patients.</p><p><b><i>Special populations: </i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Because of the risk of adverse effects, corticosteroids should be used cautiously in the elderly in the smallest possible effective dose for the shortest duration.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues: </i></b></p><p>• Flammable contents: Rectal foam contains flammable propellants. Avoid fire, flame and smoking during and immediately following administration. Temporarily discontinue use before initiation of bowel preparation for colonoscopy; consult health care provider prior to resuming therapy.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Baseline hepatic function tests; serum glucose, electrolytes; presence of infection, signs/symptoms of hypercortisolism, blood pressure as clinically indicated.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Fertility may be decreased in females with active inflammatory bowel disease. Corticosteroids used for the management of inflammatory bowel disease are not expected to decrease female fertility (AGA [Mahadevan 2019]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Hypoadrenalism may occur in newborns following maternal use of corticosteroids in pregnancy; monitor.</p><p>Because systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of gestational diabetes and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, use for maintenance therapy in pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease is not recommended. However, corticosteroids may be used to treat disease flares in pregnant patients (AGA [Mahadevan 2019]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat ulcerative colitis.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
