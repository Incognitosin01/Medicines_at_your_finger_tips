May depress the formation, release, and activity of endogenous chemical mediators of inflammation (kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins) through the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins (lipocortins) and sequential inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Acute otitis media: </b>Treatment of acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) due to susceptible isolates of  <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis,</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> in pediatric patients 6 months and older. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, fluocinolone, other corticosteroids, or any component of the formulation; viral infection of the external ear canal, including varicella and herpes simplex infections; fungal otic infections</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Acute otitis media in patients with tympanostomy tubes:</b> Not indicated for use in adult patients; however, no major differences in safety/efficacy were observed between adult and pediatric patients.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Acute otitis media in patients with tympanostomy tubes:</b> Infants ≥6 months, Children, and Adolescents: Ciprofloxacin 0.3% fluocinolone 0.025% solution: Otic: Instill 0.25 mL (ciprofloxacin 0.75 mg/fluocinolone 0.0625 mg) into affected ear canal twice daily for 7 days</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Otic: For otic use only; not for injection or ophthalmic use. Prior to use, warm solution by holding container in hands for 1 to 2 minutes. Patient should lie down with affected ear upward. Administer into ear canal. Gently pump tragus 4 times to facilitate penetration into the middle ear. Patients should remain on side for at least 1 minute to allow penetration of solution.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).

Prompt discontinuation of drug should occur if skin rash or other symptoms of hypersensitivity arise.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection. If superinfection occurs, discontinue use and institute appropriate alternative therapy.</p><p>• Tendon inflammation/rupture: There have been reports of tendon inflammation and/or rupture with systemic fluoroquinolones. Exposure following otic administration is substantially lower than with systemic therapy. Discontinue at first sign of tendon inflammation or pain.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For otic use only; not for injection or ophthalmic use. Prior to instillation, suspension should be warmed in hands to prevent dizziness, which may occur following use of a cold solution.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Resolution of infection; if infection persists after one week of treatment, obtain cultures to guide further treatment. If otorrhea persists after a full course of therapy, or if ≥2 episodes occur within 6 months, evaluate to exclude an underlying condition (eg, cholesteatoma, foreign body, tumor).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Due to limited systemic absorption, exposure of ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone to the fetus is not expected following maternal otic administration.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat ear infections.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
