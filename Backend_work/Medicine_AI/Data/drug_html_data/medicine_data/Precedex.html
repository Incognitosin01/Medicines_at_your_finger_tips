The tube is then attached to the ventilator, which pumps air slowly into the lungs to control the patient's breathing. Sedation with Precedex can help keep the patient relaxed and comfortable while the ventilator and tube are in place.</p><p>Precedex is also used during anesthesia to get a patient ready for a surgery or other medical procedure.</p><p>Precedex may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before Precedex is given, the doctor should know about all the patient's medical conditions or allergies, and all other medicines the patient is using. Also make sure the doctor knows if the patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Precedex if you are allergic to it.</p><p>To make sure Precedex is safe to give, tell the doctor if the patient has:</p><ul>

The most common withdrawal symptoms are nausea, vomiting, and agitation. The patient may also have rapid heartbeats and increased blood pressure.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because  Precedex is given in a controlled clinical setting, a missed dose is not likely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  Precedex is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><p>In the event of an overdose, medical care providers in an intensive care setting are able to quickly treat any symptoms that may occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving  Precedex?</h2><p>Follow the doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Precedex side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if the patient has <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Tell the medical caregivers right away if the person receiving Precedex has:</p><ul>
