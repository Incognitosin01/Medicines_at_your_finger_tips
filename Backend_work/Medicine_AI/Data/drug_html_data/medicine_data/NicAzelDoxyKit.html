Doxycycline 100 mg tablets contain doxycycline monohydrate equivalent to 100 mg of doxycycline for oral administration. Inactive ingredients include anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, talc, D&amp;C yellow #10 aluminum lake, and FD&amp;C yellow #6 aluminum lake. The chemical designation of the light-yellow crystalline powder is 4-(Dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,5,10,12,12a-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide monohydrate.</p><p>Structural formula:</p><p></p><p>Doxycycline has a high degree of lipid solubility and a low affinity for calcium binding. It is highly stable in normal human serum. Doxycycline will not degrade into an epianhydro form.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration.</p><p>Following a 200 mg dose of doxycycline monohydrate, 24 normal adult volunteers averaged the following serum concentration values:</p><p class="First">Time (hr):</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">2.0</p><p class="First">3.0</p><p class="First">4.0</p><p class="First">8.0</p><p class="First">12.0</p><p class="First">24.0</p><p class="First">48.0</p><p class="First">72.0</p><p class="First">Conc.

This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1-5%/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18-22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.</p><p>Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MICROBIOLOGY:</span></p><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Cross resistance with other tetracyclines is common. Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the package insert for doxycycline tablets.</p><h3>Gram-Negative Bacteria</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Acinetobacter</span> species<br/>

These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial.</p><h3>Dilution techniques</h3><p class="First">Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth and/or agar).<span class="Sup">1,2,4</span> The MIC values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>.</p><h3>Diffusion techniques</h3><p class="First">Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.</p><p>The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method.<span class="Sup">1,3,4</span> This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg doxycycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to doxycycline.

However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to doxycycline.</p><p>† The current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any results other than "Susceptible". If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible, they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.</p><p>‡ Gonococci with 30 mcg tetracycline disk zone diameters of less than 19 mm usually indicate a plasmid-mediated tetracycline resistant <span class="Italics">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> isolate.

A report of <span class="Italics">Intermediate</span> (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the bacteria is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug product is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used.

This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, EXCEPT FOR ANTHRAX, INCLUDING INHALATIONAL ANTHRAX (POST-EXPOSURE), UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline tablets, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</span></span></p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</span></span></p><p>All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryo toxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p>The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.</p><p>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span></p><h3>General:</h3><p class="First">As with other antibacterial preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, doxycycline tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><p>Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline tablets. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline tablets should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.</p><p>Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.</p><p>Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibacterial therapy when indicated.</p><p>Prescribing doxycycline tablets in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Information for Patients:</h3><p class="First">All patients taking doxycycline should be advised:<br/>
-to avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (e.g., skin eruptions, etc.) occurs. Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.)<br/>
-to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>.)<br/>
-that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with foods, especially those which contain calcium. However, the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk. (See <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>.)<br/>
-that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taking bismuth subsalicylate. (See <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>.)<br/>
-not to use outdated or poorly stored doxycycline.<br/>
-that the use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including doxycycline tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When doxycycline tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests:</h3><p class="First">In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months.</p><p>In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies should be performed.</p><h3>Drug Interactions:</h3><p class="First">Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.</p><p>Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.</p><p>Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.</p><p>Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.</p><p>The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.</p><p>Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:</h3><p class="First">False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with related antibacterial, oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors) and minocycline (thyroid tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted, positive results in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibacterial (tetracycline, oxytetracycline). Doxycycline administered orally at dosage levels as high as 250 mg/kg/day had no apparent effect on the fertility of female rats. Effect on male fertility has not been studied.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category D:</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of doxycycline in pregnant short-term, first trimester exposure. There are no human data available to assess the effects of long-term therapy of doxycycline in pregnant women such as that proposed for treatment of anthrax exposure. An expert review of published data on experiences with doxycycline use during pregnancy by TERIS – the Teratogen Information System - concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (the quantity and quality of data were assessed as limited to fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.<span class="Sup">8</span></p><p>A case-control study (18,515 mothers of infants with congenital anomalies and 32,804 mothers of infants with no congenital anomalies) shows a weak but marginally statistically significant association with total malformations and use of doxycycline anytime during pregnancy. (Sixty-three [0.19%] of the controls and 56 [0.30%] of the cases were treated with doxycycline.) This association was not seen when the analysis was confined to maternal treatment during the period of organogenesis (i.e., in the second and third months of gestation) with the exception of a marginal relationship with neural tube defect based on only two exposed cases.<span class="Sup">9</span></p><p>A small prospective study of 81 pregnancies describes 43 pregnant women treated for 10 days with doxycycline during early first trimester. All mothers reported their exposed infants were normal at 1 year of age.<span class="Sup">10</span></p><p class="First">The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown.</p><p class="First">Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk, however, the extent of absorption of tetracyclines, including doxycycline, by the breastfed infant is not known. Short-term use by lactating women is not necessarily contraindicated; however, the effects of prolonged exposure to doxycycline in breast milk are unknown.11 Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from doxycycline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.)</p><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> sections.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal</span>: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region. Hepatotoxicity has been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed. (See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.)</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin</span>: Maculopapular and erythematous rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythema multiforme have been reported. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.)</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span>: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.)</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity Reaction</span>s: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood</span>: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported with tetracyclines.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other</span>: Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS – Genera</span>l.)</p><p>When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. No abnormalities of thyroid function are known to occur.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life, and it would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage.</p><h2>NicAzel Doxy Kit Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span>: The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.</p><p><span class="Bold">For pediatric patients above eight years of age</span>: The recommended dosage schedule for pediatric patients weighing 100 pounds or less is 2 mg/lb of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by 1 mg/lb of body weight given as a single daily dose or divided into two doses, on subsequent days. For more severe infections up to 2 mg/lb of body weight may be used. For pediatric patients over 100 pounds the usual adult dose should be used.</p><p><span class="Bold">Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults (except anorectal infections in men</span>): 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acute epididymo-orchitis caused by <span class="Italics">N. gonorrhoeae</span></span>: 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 10 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Primary and secondary syphilis</span>: 300 mg a day in divided doses for at least 10 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by <span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span></span>: 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 7 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nongonococcal urethritis caused by <span class="Italics">C. trachomatis</span> and <span class="Italics">U. urealyticum</span></span>: 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 7 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acute epididymo-orchitis caused by <span class="Italics">C. trachomatis</span></span>: 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 10 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Inhalational anthrax (post-exposure)</span>:<br/>
ADULTS: 100 mg of doxycycline, by mouth, twice a day for 60 days.<br/>
CHILDREN: weighing less than 100 pounds (45 kg); 1 mg/lb (2.2 mg/kg) of body weight, by mouth, twice a day for 60 days. Children weighing 100 pounds or more should receive the adult dose.</p><p>When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.</p><p>Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>.) If gastric irritation occurs, doxycycline may be given with food. Ingestion of a high fat meal has been shown to delay the time to peak plasma concentrations by an average of one hour and 20 minutes. However, in the same study, food enhanced the average peak concentration by 7.5% and the area under the curve by 5.7%.</p><h2>How is NicAzel Doxy Kit Supplied</h2><p class="First">Doxycycline Tablets 100 mg are yellow, film coated, caplets, debossed LCI on one face and 1338 on the other face.
