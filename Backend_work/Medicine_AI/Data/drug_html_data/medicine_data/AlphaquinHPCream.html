Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of the bleached areas [Parrish, J.A. et al., 1978 (3)].</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Alphaquin HP Cream</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALPHAQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% CREAM</span> is indicated for the gradual bleaching of hyperpigmented skin conditions such as chloasma, melasma, freckles, senile lentigines and other undesired areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALPHAQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% CREAM</span> is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to hydroquinone or any of the other ingredients. The safety of topical treatment of hydroquinone during pregnancy or in children (12 years and under) has not been established. (See PRECAUTIONS).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(SEE WARNINGS)</span></p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hydroquinone. It is also not known whether hydroquinone can cause fetal harm when administered on a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. It is also not known to what degree, if any, topical hydroquinone is absorbed systemically. Topical hydroquinone should be used in pregnant women only when clearly indicated.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether topical administration of hydroquinone is absorbed or excreted in human milk. Caution is advised when topical hydroquinone is used by a nursing mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years has not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur in which case the medication should be discontinued and the physician notified immediately.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no systemic reactions reported from the use of topical hydroquinone treatment. However, treatment should be limited to relatively small areas of the body at one time since some patients may experience a transient skin reddening and a mild burning sensation which does not preclude treatment.</p><h2>Alphaquin HP Cream Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALPHAQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% CREAM</span> should be applied to affected areas twice daily, in the morning and before bedtime, or as directed by a physician. Unnecessary solar exposure should be avoided. There is no recommended dosage for children under 12 years of age except under the advice and supervision of a physician. Keep container tightly closed. NOTE: Slight darkening of <span class="Bold">ALPHAQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% CREAM</span> is normal and does not affect potency of the product.</p><h2>How is Alphaquin HP Cream Supplied</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ALPHAQUIN<span class="Sup">®</span> HP 4% CREAM</span> (Hydroquinone, USP 4%) is supplied as follows:</p><h3>STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F), excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (between 59°F and 86°F).
