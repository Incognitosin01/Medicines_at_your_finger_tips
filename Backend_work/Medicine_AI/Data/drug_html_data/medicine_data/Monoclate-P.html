A murine monoclonal antibody to VWF:Ag is used as an affinity ligand to first isolate the Factor VIII Complex. Factor VIII:C is then dissociated from VWF:Ag, recovered, formulated and provided as a sterile lyophilized powder.<span class="Sup">1,2,3</span> The concentrate as formulated contains Albumin (Human) as a stabilizer, resulting in a concentrate with a specific activity between 4 and 10 units/mg of total protein. In the absence of this added Albumin (Human) stabilizer, specific activity has been determined to exceed 3000 units/mg of protein.<span class="Sup">4</span> Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> has been prepared from pooled human plasma and is intended for use in therapy of classical hemophilia (Hemophilia A).</p><p>All Source Plasma used in the manufacture of this product was tested by FDA-licensed Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT) for HCV and HIV-1 and found to be nonreactive (negative).</p><p>An investigational NAT for HBV was also performed on all Source Plasma used in the manufacture of this product and found to be nonreactive (negative). The aim of the HBV test is to detect low levels of viral material, however, the significance of a nonreactive (negative) result has not been established.</p><p>This concentrate has been pasteurized by heating at 60°C for 10 hours in aqueous solution form during its manufacture in order to further reduce the risk of viral transmission.<span class="Sup">5</span> However, no procedure has been shown to be totally effective in removing viral infectivity from coagulant factor concentrates (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span> and <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> is a highly purified preparation of Factor VIII:C. When stored as directed, it will maintain its labeled potency for the period indicated on the container and package labels.<span class="Sup">6,7</span></p><p>Upon reconstitution of the 250, 500 and 1000 I.U. concentrates, a clear, colorless solution is obtained, containing 50 to 150 times as much Factor VIII:C as does an equal volume of plasma.</p><p>Upon reconstitution of the 1500 I.U. concentrate, a clear, colorless solution is obtained, containing 120 to 180 times as much Factor VIII:C as does an equal volume of plasma.</p><p>Each vial contains the labeled amount of antihemophilic factor (AHF) activity as expressed in terms of International Units (I.U.) of antihemophilic activity. One unit of antihemophilic activity is equivalent to that quantity of AHF present in one mL of normal human plasma. When reconstituted as recommended, the resulting solution contains approximately 300 to 450 millimoles of sodium ions per liter and has 2 to 3 times the tonicity of saline. It contains approximately 2-5 millimoles of calcium ions per liter, contributed as calcium chloride, approximately 1 to 2% Albumin (Human), 0.8% mannitol, and 1.2 mM histidine. The pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> also contains trace amounts (≤50 ng per 100 I.U. of AHF) of the murine monoclonal antibody used in its purification (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><p>Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> is to be administered only intravenously.</p><h2>Monoclate-P - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Factor VIII:C is the coagulant portion of the Factor VIII complex circulating in plasma. It is noncovalently associated with the von Willebrand protein responsible for von Willebrand factor activity. These two proteins have distinct biochemical and immunological properties and are under separate genetic control. Factor VIII:C acts as a cofactor for Factor IX to activate Factor X in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation.<span class="Sup">8</span> Hemophilia A, a hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of Factor VIII:C, results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs as a result of a trauma. Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> provides an increase in plasma levels of AHF, thereby enabling temporary correction of Hemophilia A bleeding.</p><p>Clinical evaluation of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> concentrate for its half-life characteristics in hemophilic patients showed it to be comparable to other commercially available Antihemophilic Factor (Human) concentrates. The mean half-life obtained from six patients was 17.5 hours with a mean recovery of 1.9 units/dl rise/U/kg.</p><p>The pasteurization process used in the manufacture of this concentrate has demonstrated <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and several model viruses. In two separate studies, HIV was reduced by ≥7.0 log<span class="Sub">10</span> to an undetectable level and by 10.5 log<span class="Sub">10</span>, respectively. In addition to HIV, studies were also performed using three lipid containing model viruses and one non-lipid, encapsulated model virus. Vesicular stomatitis (VSV) was reduced by ≥6.79 log<span class="Sub">10</span> to undetectable, Sindbis was reduced by ≥6.48 log<span class="Sub">10</span> to undetectable and Vaccinia was reduced by ≥5.36 log<span class="Sub">10</span> to undetectable. Murine encephalomyocarditis (EMC), a non-lipid, encapsulated model virus, was reduced by ≥7.1 log<span class="Sub">10</span> to undetectable.</p><p>Evidence of the capability of the purification and preparative steps used in the production of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> to reduce viral bioburden was obtained in studies involving the addition of known quantities of virus to cryoprecipitate. These studies were conducted using an earlier form of the concentrate which had not undergone liquid pasteurization (Monoclate<span class="Sup">®</span>, Antihemophilic Factor (Human), Monoclonal Antibody Purified, Factor VIII:C, Heat-Treated). These studies provide evidence of the viral removal potential of the purification and preparative steps of the manufacturing process (exclusive of heat treatment) which are common to both concentrates. In one study, the viruses used were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and pseudorabies virus (PsRV). A comparison of the cumulative mean reductions for all viruses tested with the individual values obtained in each experiment indicates that the combined effects of the manufacturing steps, which purify the Factor VIII:C and prepare the concentrate in a final sterile container as a lyophilized powder, contribute viral reduction capabilities of approximately 5 to 6 logs. In a separate study, aluminum hydroxide treatment followed by antibody affinity chromatography reduced vaccinia virus infectivity by 4.81 logs. These studies indicate that the purification and preparative steps of the manufacturing process are capable of providing a non-specific, viral reduction of approximately 5 to 6 logs, independent of the pasteurization process.</p><p>Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> contains trace amounts of mouse protein<span class="Sup">9</span> (≤50 ng per 100 I.U. of AHF). In a study using an earlier form of the concentrate which had not undergone pasteurization (Monoclate<span class="Sup">®</span>), a number of patients seronegative for Anti-HIV-1 were monitored to determine whether they would develop antibody or experience adverse reactions as a result of repeated exposure. These patients were treated on multiple occasions. Pre-study serum measurements of 27 patients for human anti-mouse IgG showed that, prior to treatment, 6 of them had either detectable antibody to mouse proteins or cross-reactive proteins. These patients continued to demonstrate similar or lower antibody levels during the study. Of the remaining 21 patients, 6 were shown to have low antibody levels on one or more occasions. In no case was observance of low antibody level associated with an anamnestic response or with any clinical adverse reaction. Patients were observed for time periods ranging from 2 to 30 months.</p><p>The viral safety of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> has been evaluated in two open-label studies using patients (aged 1 day to 20 years) with moderate to severe hemophilia A previously unexposed to blood or blood products. Thirty patients received Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy for 5 to 34 months as necessary according to the normal practices of the treatment center. These patients were followed for serum ALT elevations and a range of viral serologies. Six patients received another blood product prior to or during the study. Twenty-four patients were evaluable for assessment of viral safety of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span>. No patients seroconverted to HIV, hepatitis nonA/nonB, or hepatitis B. Factor VIII:C inhibitors developed in 7 patients (23%) with 3 being high (&gt;10 BU) titer.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Monoclate-P</h2><p class="First">Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for treatment of classical hemophilia (Hemophilia A). Affected individuals frequently require therapy following minor accidents. Surgery, when required in such individuals, must be preceded by temporary corrections of the clotting abnormality. Surgical prophylaxis in severe AHF deficiency can be accomplished with an appropriately-dosed pre-surgical IV bolus of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> followed by intermittent maintenance doses (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> is not effective in controlling the bleeding of patients with von Willebrand's disease.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Known hypersensitivity to mouse protein is a contraindication to Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> is made from human blood. Products made from human plasma may contain infectious agents, such as viruses, that can cause disease. Because Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. The risk that such products will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing for the presence of certain current viral infections and inactivating and/or removing certain viruses during manufacture (see <span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span> section for viral reduction measures). The manufacturing procedure for Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> includes processing steps designed to reduce further the risk of viral transmission. Stringent procedures utilized at plasma collection centers, plasma testing laboratories, and fractionation facilities are designed to reduce the risk of viral transmission. The primary viral reduction step of the Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> manufacturing process is the heat treatment of the purified, stabilized aqueous solution at 60°C for 10 hours. In addition, the purification procedure (several precipitation steps) used in the manufacture of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> also provides viral reduction capacity. Despite these measures, such products may still potentially contain human pathogenic agents, including those not yet known or identified. Thus the risk of transmission of infectious agents can not be totally eliminated. Any infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to CSL Behring at 800-504-5434 (in the U.S. or Canada).</p><p>Individuals who receive infusions of blood or plasma products may develop signs and/or symptoms of some viral infections (see <span class="Bold">Information For Patients</span>).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Most Antihemophilic Factor (Human) concentrates contain naturally occurring blood group specific antibodies. However, the processing of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> significantly reduces the presence of blood group specific antibodies in the final product. Nevertheless, when large or frequently repeated doses of product are needed, patients should be monitored by means of hematocrit and direct Coombs tests for signs of progressive anemia.</p><h3>Formation of Antibodies to Mouse Protein</h3><p class="First">Although no hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, because Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> contains trace amounts of mouse protein (≤50 ng per 100 I.U. of AHF), the possibility exists that patients treated with Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> may develop hypersensitivity to the mouse proteins.</p><h3>Information For Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis, and should be advised to discontinue use of the concentrate and contact their physician if these symptoms occur.</p><p>Some viruses, such as parvovirus B19 or hepatitis A, are particularly difficult to remove or inactivate at this time. Parvovirus B19 most seriously affects pregnant women, or immune-compromised individuals.</p><p>Although the overwhelming number of hepatitis A and parvovirus B19 cases are community acquired, there have been reports of these infections associated with the use of some plasma-derived products. Therefore, physicians should be alert to the potential symptoms of parvovirus B19 and hepatitis A infections and inform patients under their supervision receiving plasma derived products to report potential symptoms promptly.</p><p>Symptoms of parvovirus B19 include fever, drowsiness, chills and runny nose followed two weeks later by a rash and joint pain. Evidence of hepatitis A may include several days to weeks of poor appetite, tiredness, and low-grade fever followed by nausea, vomiting and pain in the belly. Dark urine and a yellowed complexion are also common symptoms. Patients should be encouraged to consult their physicians if such symptoms occur.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span>. It is also not known whether Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> for the treatment of hemophilia A has been demonstrated in 33 pediatric patients. As in adults, pediatric patients should be dosed based upon weight (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Dosing should be appropriate to the clinical situation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Products of this type are known to cause allergic reactions, mild chills, nausea or stinging at the infusion site. In some cases, inhibitors of FVIII may occur.</p><h2>Monoclate-P Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Monoclate-P<span class="Sup">®</span> is for intravenous administration only. As a general rule 1 unit of AHF activity per kg will increase the circulating AHF level by 2%.<span class="Sup">10</span> The following formula<span class="Sup">10</span> provides a guide of dosage calculations for both adult and pediatric patients:</p><p>Although dosage must be individualized according to the needs of the patient (weight, severity of hemorrhage, presence of inhibitors), the following general dosages are suggested.<span class="Sup">11</span></p><h3>Reconstitution</h3><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CAUTION</span>: This kit contains two devices, a stainless steel 5 micron filter needle, individually labeled as a 5 micron filter needle and contained in a separate blister pack, and an all plastic 5 micron vented filter spike which is supplied with the four-item administration components blister pack, either of which may be used to withdraw the reconstituted product for administration.
