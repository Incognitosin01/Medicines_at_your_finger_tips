The overall incidence of ILD in approximately 32,000 erlotinib-treated patients in uncontrolled studies and studies with concurrent chemotherapy was approximately 1.1%. In patients with ILD, the onset of symptoms was between 5 days to more than 9 months (median 39 days) after initiating erlotinib therapy.</p><p>Withhold erlotinib for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If ILD is confirmed, permanently discontinue erlotinib <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Failure</h3><p class="First">Hepatorenal syndrome, severe acute renal failure including fatal cases, and renal insufficiency can occur with erlotinib treatment. Renal failure may arise from exacerbation of underlying baseline hepatic impairment or severe dehydration. The pooled incidence of severe renal impairment in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.5% in the erlotinib arms and 0.8% in the control arms. The incidence of renal impairment in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the erlotinib plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. Withhold erlotinib in patients developing severe renal impairment until renal toxicity is resolved. Perform periodic monitoring of renal function and serum electrolytes during erlotinib treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity with or without Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, including fatal cases, can occur with erlotinib treatment in patients with normal hepatic function; the risk of hepatic toxicity is increased in patients with baseline hepatic impairment. In clinical studies where patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment were excluded, the pooled incidence of hepatic failure in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.4% in the erlotinib arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of hepatic failure in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the erlotinib plus gemcitabine arm and 0.4% in the control arm. In a pharmacokinetic study in 15 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) associated with significant liver tumor burden, 10 of these 15 patients died within 30 days of the last erlotinib dose. One patient died from hepatorenal syndrome, 1 patient died from rapidly progressing liver failure and the remaining 8 patients died from progressive disease. Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline total bilirubin &gt; 3 x ULN.</p><p>Perform periodic liver testing (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) during treatment with erlotinib. Increased frequency of monitoring of liver function is required for patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction. Withhold erlotinib in patients without pre-existing hepatic impairment for total bilirubin levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal or transaminases greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Withhold erlotinib in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or biliary obstruction for doubling of bilirubin or tripling of transaminases values over baseline. Discontinue erlotinib in patients whose abnormal liver tests meeting the above criteria do not improve significantly or resolve within three weeks <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Gastrointestinal Perforation</h3><p class="First">Gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal cases, can occur with erlotinib treatment. Patients receiving concomitant anti-angiogenic agents, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or taxane-based chemotherapy, or who have prior history of peptic ulceration or diverticular disease may be at increased risk of perforation <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>. The pooled incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.2% in the erlotinib arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The incidence of gastrointestinal perforation in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the erlotinib plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Permanently discontinue erlotinib in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders</h3><p class="First">Bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin conditions, including cases suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, which in some cases were fatal, can occur with erlotinib treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>. The pooled incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 1.2% in the erlotinib arms and 0% in the control arms. The incidence of bullous and exfoliative skin disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was 0.4% in the erlotinib plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm. Discontinue erlotinib treatment if the patient develops severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating conditions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Accident</h3><p class="First">In the pancreatic carcinoma trial, seven patients in the erlotinib/gemcitabine group developed cerebrovascular accidents (incidence: 2.5%). One of these was hemorrhagic and was the only fatal event. In comparison, in the placebo/gemcitabine group there were no cerebrovascular accidents. The pooled incidence of cerebrovascular accident in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0.6% in the erlotinib arms and not higher than that observed in the control arms.</p><h3>Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia with Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">The pooled incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 0% in the erlotinib arms and 0.1% in the control arms. The incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia in the pancreatic cancer study was 1.4% in the erlotinib plus gemcitabine arm and 0% in the control arm.</p><h3>Ocular Disorders</h3><p class="First">Decreased tear production, abnormal eyelash growth, keratoconjunctivitis sicca or keratitis can occur with erlotinib treatment and can lead to corneal perforation or ulceration <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and (6.2)]</span>. The pooled incidence of ocular disorders in the 3 monotherapy lung cancer studies was 17.8% in the erlotinib arms and 4% in the control arms. The incidence of ocular disorders in the pancreatic cancer study was 12.8% in the erlotinib plus gemcitabine arm and 11.4% in the control arm. Interrupt or discontinue erlotinib therapy if patients present with acute or worsening ocular disorders such as eye pain <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Hemorrhage in Patients Taking Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Severe and fatal hemorrhage associated with International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations can occur when erlotinib and warfarin are administered concurrently. Regularly monitor prothrombin time and INR during erlotinib treatment in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, erlotinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. When given during organogenesis, erlotinib administration resulted in embryo-fetal lethality and abortion in rabbits at exposures approximately 3 times the exposure at the recommended human daily dose of 150 mg. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for one month after the last dose of erlotinib <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and</span> <span class="Italics">(8.3)</span><span class="Italics">, Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Safety evaluation of erlotinib is based on more than 1200 cancer patients who received erlotinib as monotherapy, more than 300 patients who received erlotinib 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and 1228 patients who received erlotinib concurrently with other chemotherapies. The most common adverse reactions with erlotinib are rash and diarrhea usually with onset during the first month of treatment. The incidences of rash and diarrhea from clinical studies of erlotinib for the treatment of NSCLC and pancreatic cancer were 70% for rash and 42% for diarrhea.</p><p class="First">The most frequent (≥ 30%) adverse reactions in erlotinib-treated patients were diarrhea, asthenia, rash, cough, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. In erlotinib-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 15 days and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 32 days.</p><p>The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions in erlotinib-treated patients were rash and diarrhea.</p><p>Dose interruptions or reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 37% of erlotinib-treated patients, and 14.3% of erlotinib-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In erlotinib-treated patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose modification were rash (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (3.6%).</p><p>Common adverse reactions in Study 1, occurring in at least 10% of patients who received erlotinib or chemotherapy and an increase in ≥ 5% in the erlotinib-treated group, are graded by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) Grade in Table 1.

Erlotinib hydrochloride is very slightly soluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol and practically insoluble in acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate and hexane.</p><p>Aqueous solubility of erlotinib hydrochloride is dependent on pH with increased solubility at a pH of less than 5 due to protonation of the secondary amine. Over the pH range of 1.4 to 9.6, maximal solubility of approximately 0.4 mg/mL occurs at a pH of approximately 2.</p><p>Erlotinib Tablets for oral administration are available in three dosage strengths containing erlotinib hydrochloride (27.3 mg, 109.3 mg and 163.9 mg) equivalent to 25 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg erlotinib and the following inactive ingredients: hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch glycolate (potato) and titanium dioxide.</p><h2>Erlotinib Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed on the cell surface of both normal and cancer cells. In some tumor cells signaling through this receptor plays a role in tumor cell survival and proliferation irrespective of EGFR mutation status. Erlotinib reversibly inhibits the kinase activity of EGFR, preventing autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues associated with the receptor and thereby inhibiting further downstream signaling. Erlotinib binding affinity for EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) mutations is higher than its affinity for the wild type receptor. Erlotinib inhibition of other tyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Erlotinib is about 60% absorbed after oral administration.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive erlotinib 150 mg or placebo orally once daily (322 erlotinib, 321 placebo) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Following progression on initial therapy, patients were eligible to enter an open-label phase. Baseline characteristics were as follows: median age 61 years (35% age ≥ 65 years), 75% male, 77% White, 21% Asian, 28% ECOG PS 0, 72% ECOG PS 1, 16% never smokers, 58% current smokers, 57% adenocarcinoma, 35% squamous cell carcinoma, 22% stage IIIB disease not amenable to combined modality treatment, and 78% stage IV disease. Fifty percent of patients randomized to erlotinib entered the open-label phase and received chemotherapy, while 77% of patients randomized to placebo entered the open-label phase and received erlotinib.</p><p>The main efficacy outcome was overall survival (OS). Median OS was 9.7 months in the erlotinib arm and 9.5 months in the placebo arm; the hazard ratio for OS was 1.02 (95% CI 0.85, 1.22). Median PFS was 3.0 months in the erlotinib arm and 2.8 months in the placebo arm; the hazard ratio for PFS was 0.94 (95% CI 0.80, 1.11).</p><h3>NSCLC - Maintenance Treatment or Second/Third Line Treatment</h3><p class="First">Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, Studies 3 and 4, examined the efficacy and safety of erlotinib administered to patients with metastatic NSCLC as maintenance therapy after initial treatment with chemotherapy (Study 3) or with disease progression following initial treatment with chemotherapy (Study 4). Determination of EGFR mutation status was not required for enrollment.</p><p class="First">The efficacy and safety of erlotinib as maintenance treatment of NSCLC were demonstrated in Study 3, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 26 countries, in 889 patients with metastatic NSCLC whose disease did not progress during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive erlotinib 150 mg or placebo orally once daily (438 erlotinib, 451 placebo) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective of the study was to determine if the administration of erlotinib after standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC resulted in improved progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with placebo, in all patients or in patients with EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC) positive tumors.</p><p>Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (74%), age &lt; 65 years (66%), ECOG PS 1 (69%), ECOG PS 0 (31%), white (84%), Asian (15%), current smoker (55%), past-smoker (27%), and never smoker (17%).

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive erlotinib (100 mg or 150 mg) or placebo once daily on a continuous schedule plus gemcitabine by intravenous infusion (1000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, Cycle 1 - Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43 of an 8-week cycle; Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles - Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 4-week cycle [the approved dose and schedule for pancreatic cancer, see the gemcitabine package insert]). Erlotinib or placebo were taken orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was survival. Secondary endpoints included response rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). Duration of response was also examined. The study was conducted in 18 countries. A total of 285 patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine plus erlotinib (261 patients in the 100 mg cohort and 24 patients in the 150 mg cohort) and 284 patients were randomized to receive gemcitabine plus placebo (260 patients in the 100 mg cohort and 24 patients in the 150 mg cohort). Too few patients were treated in the 150 mg cohort to draw conclusions.</p><p>In the 100 mg cohort, baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (52%), white (88%), Asian (7%), black (2%), age &lt; 65 years (53%), ECOG PS 1 (51%), ECOG PS 0 (32%), and ECOG PS 2 (17%). There was a slightly larger proportion of females in the erlotinib arm (51%) compared with the placebo arm (44%). The median time from initial diagnosis to randomization was approximately 1.0 month.
