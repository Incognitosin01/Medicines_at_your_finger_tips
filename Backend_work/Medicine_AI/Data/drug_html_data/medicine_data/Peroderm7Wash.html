</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION: Peroderm<span class="Sup">TM</span> Wash (7% Benzoyl Peroxide)</span> is intended for topical administration and contains Benzoyl Peroxide for use in the treatment of acne vulgaris. Benzoyl Peroxide is an oxidizing agent that possesses antibacterial properties and is classified as a keratolytic. Benzoyl Peroxide (C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>) is represented by the following chemical structure:</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">O=C-O-O-C=O</span></p><p>Each mL of <span class="Bold">Peroderm<span class="Sup">TM</span> Wash (7% Benzoyl Peroxide</span><span class="Bold">)</span> contains 70mg of Benzoyl Peroxide in an emulsion based formulation consisting of: aloe, carbomer interpolymer type A, cetyl alcohol, disodium oleamido MEA-sulfosuccinate, edetate disodium, glycerin, glyceryl stearate/PEG-100 stearate, green tea, laureth-12, magnesium aluminum silicate, propylene glycol, purified water, sodium coco-sulfate, sodium lauroamphoacetate, xanthan gum.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</span> The mechanism of action of Benzoyl Peroxide is not totally understood but its antibacterial activity against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span> is thought to be a major mode of action. In addition, patients treated with Benzoyl Peroxide show a reduction in lipids and free fatty acids, and mild desquamation (drying and peeling activity) with simultaneous reduction in comedones and acne lesions. Little is known about the percutaneous penetration, metabolism, and excretion of Benzoyl Peroxide, although it has been shown that Benzoyl Peroxide absorbed by the skin is metabolized to benzoic acid and then excreted as benzoate in the urine. There is no evidence of systemic toxicity caused by Benzoyl Peroxide in humans.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Peroderm<span class="Sup">TM</span> Wash (7% Benzoyl Peroxide)</span> is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> These preparations are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of their components.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> When using this product, avoid unnecessary sun exposure and use a sunscreen.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> General: For external use only.

If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. Contact with any colored material (including hair and fabric) may result in bleaching or discoloration. If excessive irritation develops, discontinue use and consult your physician.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> Data from several studies employing a strain of mice that is highly susceptible to developing cancer suggest that Benzoyl Peroxide acts as a tumor promoter. The clinical significance of these findings to humans is unknown. Benzoyl Peroxide has not been found to be mutagenic (Ames Test) and there are no published data indicating it impairs fertility.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C:</span> Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Benzoyl Peroxide. It is not known whether Benzoyl Peroxide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Benzoyl Peroxide should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. There are no available data on the effect of Benzoyl Peroxide on the later growth, development and functional maturation of the unborn child. <span class="Bold">If pregnant, or planning to become pregnant or are currently breast-feeding please contact your physician, or health-care provider before using or continuing use.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
