Low levels of dopamine in the brain are associated with Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Mirapex is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as stiffness, tremors, muscle spasms, and poor muscle control. Mirapex is also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS).</p><p>Immediate-release tablet (Mirapex) is approved to treat either Parkinson symptoms or RLS. The extended-release tablet (Mirapex ER) is only approved to treat Parkinson symptoms.</p><p>Parkinson's and RLS are two separate disorders. Having one of these conditions will not cause you to have the other condition.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some people taking Mirapex have fallen asleep during normal daytime activities such as working, talking, eating, or driving.
