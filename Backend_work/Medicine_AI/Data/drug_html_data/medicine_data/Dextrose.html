Glucose is a source of energy, and all the cells and organs in your body need glucose to function properly. Glucose as a medication is given either by mouth (orally) or by injection.</p><p>Dextrose is used to treat very low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), most often in people with diabetes mellitus. Dextrose is given by injection to treat insulin shock (low blood sugar caused by using insulin and then not eating a meal or eating enough food afterward). This medicine works by quickly increasing the amount of glucose in your blood.</p><p>Dextrose is also used to provide carbohydrate calories to a person who cannot eat because of illness, trauma, or other medical condition. It is sometimes given to people who are sick from drinking too much alcohol.</p><p>Dextrose may also be used to treat hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium in your blood).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
