If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby. Use your medications properly to control HIV.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breastfeed. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take  Tivicay PD?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.

Swallow the tablet whole, or place it in a small amount of water. Allow the tablet to disperse (it will not dissolve completely). Stir and give the mixture to the child right away. The amount of water needed will depend on the number of tablets needed for your child's dose. Follow the instructions provided with your medicine.</p><p>The Tivicay PD regular tablet and dispersible tablet cannot be used in the same dosages. Take only the pill form your doctor has prescribed. Avoid medication errors by always checking the medicine you receive at the pharmacy.</p><p>Tivicay PD doses are based on weight in children. Your child's dose needs may change if the child gains or loses weight.</p><p>While using Tivicay PD, you may need frequent blood tests.</p><p>If you've ever had hepatitis B, using Tivicay PD can cause this virus to become active or get worse.

Do not change your dose or dosing schedule without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep the tablets in their original container, along with any packet or canister of moisture-absorbing preservative.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
