</ul><p class="First">This product is intended for use only by licensed medical personnel experienced in administering allergenic extracts and trained to provide immediate emergency treatment in the event of a life-threatening reaction.<br/>
Allergenic extracts may potentially elicit a severe life-threatening systemic reaction, rarely resulting in death.1 Therefore, emergency measures and personnel trained in their use must be available immediately in the event of such a reaction. Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms and cautioned to contact the physician’s office if symptoms occur.<br/>
This standardized extract may be more potent than regular extracts and therefore is not directly interchangeable with Jubilant HollisterStier LLC non-standardized extracts, or other manufacturers’ products. Standardized pelt and hair extracts are manufactured from different source materials and are not interchangeable. Standardized cat extracts labeled in AU/mL are not interchangeable with extracts labeled in BAU/mL. See DESCRIPTION Section.<br/>
This product should never be injected intravenously.<br/>

The selection of allergenic extracts to be used should be based on a thorough and carefully taken history of hypersensitivity, and confirmed by skin testing.19, 20<br/>
The use of mixed or unrelated antigens for skin testing is not recommended since, in the case of a positive reaction, it does not indicate which component of the mix is responsible for the reaction, while, in the case of a negative reaction, it fails to indicate whether the individual antigens at full concentration would give a positive reaction. Utilization of such mixes for compounding a treatment may result, in the former case, in administering unnecessary antigens and, in the latter case, in the omission of a needed allergen.<br/>
Avoidance of allergens is to be advocated if possible, but cannot always be attained, e.g., allergy to cat dander in kennel owners and employees, cat breeders, research workers, veterinarians, etc.<br/>
Allergens to which a patient is extremely sensitive should not be included in treatment mixes with allergens to which there is much less sensitivity, but should be administered separately. This allows individualized and better control of dosage increases, including adjustments in dosage becoming necessary after severe reactions which may occur to the highly reactive allergen.<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">There are no known absolute contraindications to immunotherapy. However, see PRECAUTIONS for pregnancy risks.<br/>
Patients with cardiovascular diseases or pulmonary diseases such as symptomatic asthma, and/or those who are receiving cardiovascular drugs such as beta blockers, may be at higher risk for severe adverse reactions. These patients may also be more refractory to the normal allergy treatment regimen. Patients should be treated only if the benefit of treatment outweighs the risks.1<br/>
Treat patients only with allergens to which they are allergic as shown by skin test reaction, have a history of symptoms on exposure to the allergen, and are likely to be exposed again. Any injections, including immunotherapy, should be avoided in patients with a bleeding tendency.<br/>
Since there are differences of opinion concerning the possibility of routine immunizations exacerbating autoimmune diseases, immunotherapy should be given cautiously to patients with autoimmune diseases and only if the risk from exposure is greater than the risk of exacerbating the autoimmune process.<br/></p><h2>Warnings</h2><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>(1) General</h3><p class="First">Concentrated extracts must be diluted prior to use: See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Section below for detailed instructions on the dilution of allergenic extracts.<br/>
Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a reduction in dosage during the initial stages of immunotherapy, as well as during maintenance therapy.<br/>
Allergenic extracts diluted with sterile Albumin Saline with Phenol (0.4%) diluent may be more potent than extracts diluted with diluents which do not contain stabilizers. When changing from non-stabilized to stabilized diluent, consider weaker initial dilutions for both intradermal testing and immunotherapy.<br/>
Sterile solutions, vials, syringes, etc. should be used and aseptic precautions observed in making dilutions.<br/>
To avoid cross-contamination, do not use the same needle to withdraw materials from vials of more than one extract, or extract followed by diluent.<br/>
A sterile tuberculin syringe graduated in 0.01 mL units should be used to measure each dose from the appropriate dilution. Aseptic techniques should always be employed when injections of allergenic extracts are being administered.<br/>
A separate sterile syringe should be used for each patient to prevent transmission of serum hepatitis and other infectious agents from one person to another.<br/>
Patient reactions to previous injections should be reviewed before each new injection. A conservative dosage schedule should be followed by the physician until a pattern of local responses is established which can be used to monitor increases in dosage.<br/>
Rarely, a patient is encountered who develops systemic reactions to minute doses of allergen and does not demonstrate increasing tolerance to injections after several months of treatment. If systemic reactions or excessive local responses occur persistently at very small doses, efforts at immunotherapy should be stopped.<br/>
PATIENTS SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN THE OFFICE FOR 30 MINUTES AFTER EACH TREATMENT INJECTION. Most severe reactions will occur within this time period, and rapid treatment measures should be instituted. See ADVERSE REACTIONS Section for such treatment measures.</p><h3>(2) Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be instructed in the recognition of adverse reactions to immunotherapy, and in particular, to the symptoms of shock. Patients should be made to understand the importance of a 30 minute observation period, and be warned to return to the office promptly if symptoms occur after leaving.</p><h3>(3)Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Patients on non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions.5<br/>
Certain medications may lessen the skin test wheal and erythema responses elicited by allergens and histamine for varying time periods. Conventional antihistamines should be discontinued at least 5 days before skin testing. Long acting antihistamines should be discontinued for at least 3 weeks prior to skin testing.24 Topical steroids should be discontinued at the skin test site for at least 2-3 weeks before skin testing.24, 25<br/>
Tricyclic antidepressants such as Doxepin should be withheld for at least 7 days before skin testing. 26 Topical local anesthetics may suppress the fl are responses and should be avoided in skin test sites.27</p><h3>(4) Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted with allergenic extracts to determine their potential for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or impairment of fertility.</p><h3>(5) Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extracts. It is also not known whether allergenic extracts can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Allergenic extracts should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.<br/>
For women who have been getting maintenance doses of allergen without side effect, the occurrence of pregnancy is not an indication to stop immunotherapy.<br/></p><h3>(6) Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">There are no current studies on secretion of the allergenic extract components in human milk or effect on the nursing infant. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when allergenic extracts are administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>(7) Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Since dosage for the pediatric population is the same as for adults 3,4 the larger volumes of solution may produce excessive discomfort. Therefore, in order to achieve the total dose required, the volume<br/>
of the dose may need to be divided into more than one injection per visit.</p><h3>(8) Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The reactions from immunotherapy can be expected to be the same in elderly patients as in younger ones. Elderly patients may be more likely to be on medication that could block the effect of epinephrine which could be used to treat serious reactions, or they could be more sensitive to the cardiovascular side effect of epinephrine because of pre-existing cardiovascular disease.26</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">See ADVERSE REACTIONS Section<br/></p><h2>Allergenic Extract, Cat Hair Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>(4) Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">(See PRECAUTIONS)<br/></p><h2>How is Allergenic Extract, Cat Hair Supplied</h2><h2>STORAGE</h2><h2>LIMITED WARRANTY</h2><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
