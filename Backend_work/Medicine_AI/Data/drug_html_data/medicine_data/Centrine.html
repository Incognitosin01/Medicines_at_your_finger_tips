</ul><h2>Centrine Description</h2><p class="First">Centrine (aminopentamide hydrogen sulfate) is a potent antispasmodic agent. As a cholinergic blocking agent for smooth muscle, its action is similar to atropine.</p><h2>ACTION</h2><p class="First">Centrine effectively reduces the tone and amplitude of colonic contractions to a greater degree and for a more extended period than does atropine.</p><p>Centrine effects a reduction in gastric secretion, a decrease in gastric acidity and a marked decrease in gastric motility.</p><p>The mydriatic and salivary effects of Centrine are less than those produced by atropine at similar dosage, permitting the control of vomiting and diarrhea with less distress to the animal due to dryness of the mouth and blurred vision.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Centrine is indicated in the treatment of acute abdominal visceral spasm, pylorospasm or hypertrophic gastritis and associated nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Centrine should not be used in animals with glaucoma because of the occurrence of mydriasis.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">FOR USE IN DOGS AND CATS ONLY.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Dryness of the mouth is the most commonly reported side effect. Blurring of vision may occur and dryness of the eyes may occur if larger (greater than therapeutic) doses are used. Centrine should be used cautiously, if at all, in pyloric obstruction because of its action in delaying gastric emptying. These effects frequently decrease with continued administration of the drug. Disturbances in urination are relatively infrequent. They vary from slightly hesitancy in initiating urination to complete inability to urinate; the latter is an indication for discontinuing the drug. After a day or two, it may be resumed at a lower dosage level.</p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Centrine (aminopentamide hydrogen sulfate) may be administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or by oral tablets according to the following schedule. If the desired effect is not obtained, the dosage may be gradually increased up to a maximum of 5 times the doses listed. When the condition has been brought under control by parenteral medication, treatment can be continued, if desired, with 0.2 mg scored tablets according to the dosage schedule.</p><h2>CAUTION</h2><p class="First">Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.</p><h2>How is Centrine Supplied</h2><p class="First">0.5 mg/mL Centrine (aminopentamide hydrogen sulfate) VETERINARY INJECTION, 10 mL vials.</p><p>0.2 mg Centrine (aminopentamide hydrogen sulfate) VETERINARY TABLETS, bottles of 100.</p><p>NDC 0856-2401-10 – 0.5 mg/mL – 10 mL vials.<br/>
