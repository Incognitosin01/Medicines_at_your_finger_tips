It works by forming a barrier or coat over the ulcer. This protects the ulcer from the acid of the stomach, allowing it to heal. Sucralfate contains an aluminum salt.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Sulcrate Suspension Plus</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
