Lidocaine is present in a 3.5% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide and has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O. The molecular weight of lidocaine is 234.34 g/mol. </span></p><p>The structural formulas are:</p><p><span class="Bold Underline">**</span><span class="Bold Underline"> </span><span class="Bold Underline">Lidocaine</span><span class="Bold Underline">**</span></p><p> </p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Gen7T</span> <span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to lidocaine, or any of the topical amide-like local anesthetic preparations or to any other component of the product.</span></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Because of the possibility of sedation, patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of heavy machinery or automobiles, and any activities made hazardous by decreased alertness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Disease:</span> Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of Lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize Lidocaine normally.</p><p><span class="Bold">Allergic Reactions:</span> Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to Lidocaine. However, this product should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain.</p><p><span class="Bold">Non-intact Skin:</span> Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of Lidocaine from increased absorption. <span class="Bold">Gen7T</span> <span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> is only recommended for use on intact skin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Eye Exposure:</span> The contact of this product with the eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritations with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns.</p><p><span class="Bold">External Heat Sources:</span> Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over patches is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma Lidocaine levels.</p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS:</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antiarrhythmic Drugs:</span> <span class="Bold">Gen7T</span> <span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> should be used with caution in patients receiving Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic.</p><p><span class="Bold">Local Anesthetics:</span> When <span class="Bold">Gen7T</span> <span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> is used concurrently with other products containing local anesthetic agents the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:</h3><p class="First">A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of topical lidocaine. The effect of <span class="Bold">Gen7T</span> <span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> on fertility has not been studied.</p><h3>PREGNANCY:</h3><p class="First">The safety of <span class="Bold">Gen7T</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> has not been established during pregnancy. There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women. <span class="Bold">Gen7T</span> <span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> should not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely needed and discussed with a physician.</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS:</h3><p class="First">The effect of Gen7T Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> on the nursing infant has not been evaluated. Caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">Gen7T</span> <span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> is administered to a nursing mother.</p><h3>PEDIATRIC / GERIATRIC USE:</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric and geriatric patients have not been established.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions are application site reactions, including dermatitis, itching or scaling. These tend to be dose-limiting and diminish with time.</p><p>Serious adverse experiences following the administration of Gen7T Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> are similar in nature to those observed in other amide anesthetic-containing agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption, or may result from hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy, or a diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">There have been no reports of over-dosage with Gen7T Patch<span class="Sup">®</span>. Signs of overdosage would include vomiting, drowsiness, coma, respiratory depression, and seizures. In the case of an overdosage, discontinue the product immediately, treat the patient symptomatically, and institute supportive measures.</span></p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gen7T</span><span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> is supplied in the following dosage form:</p><p>15 Patches [ (5 per Re-sealable Pouch) x 3 ]</p><p>3 15/16” X 5 1/2" (10 cm X 14 cm)</p><p>Made in USA</p><p><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p>Manufactured for:</p><p>7T Pharma, LLC</p><p>220 Emerald Vista Way</p><p>Las Vegas, NV 89144</p><p>800.941.2848</p><p>NDC: 70645-626-35 Size: 15 Patches</p><p><span class="Bold">Gen7T Patch</span><span class="Sup">®</span> is supplied in the following dosage form:</p><p>10 Patches [ (5 per Re-sealable Pouch) x 2 ]</p><p><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p>Manufactured for:</p><p>7T Pharma, LLC</p><p>220 Emerald Vista Way</p><p>Las Vegas, NV 89144</p><p>800.941.2848</p><p>Exclusively Distributed by:</p><p>Alexso, Inc</p><p>Los Angeles, CA 90064</p><p>NDC: 70645-626-10 Size: 10 Patches</p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL</h2><p class="First">GEN 7T Patch<br/>
