R10933-10987-COV-2067 is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying casirivimab and imdevimab for the treatment of adult subjects with mild to moderate COVID-19 (subjects with COVID-19 symptoms who are not hospitalized). The trial enrolled adult subjects who were not hospitalized and had at least 1 or more COVID-19 symptoms that were at least mild in severity. Treatment was initiated within 3 days of obtaining a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral infection determination. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 manner to receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 2,400 mg of casirivimab and imdevimab (1,200 mg of each) (n=266), or 8,000 mg of casirivimab and imdevimab (4,000 mg of each) (n=267), or placebo (n=266).</p><p>At baseline, the median age was 42 years (with 7% of subjects ages 65 years or older), 53% of the subjects were female, 85% were White, 50% were Hispanic or Latino, and 9% were Black; 34% were considered high risk (as defined in Section 2). Approximately 31% of subjects reported at least 1 severe symptom at baseline, 36% reported at least 1 moderate symptom and no severe symptoms, and 13% reported only mild symptoms. The median duration of symptoms was 3 days; mean viral load was 5.8 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL at baseline. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the casirivimab and imdevimab and placebo treatment groups.</p><p>The pre-specified primary endpoint in Phase 1/2 of trial R10933-10987-COV-2067 was the time weighted average (TWA) change from baseline in viral load (log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL), as measured by RT-qPCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples, in subjects with a positive baseline RT-qPCR value, i.e., the modified full analysis set (mFAS). In the mFAS for the Phase 1/2 analysis, the difference in TWA from Day 1 through Day 7 for the pooled doses of casirivimab and imdevimab compared with placebo (n=665) was -0.36 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL (p&lt;0.0001). The largest reductions in viral load relative to placebo occurred in patients with high viral load (-0.78 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL) or who were seronegative (-0.69 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL) at baseline. Reductions occurring from Day 1 through Day 11 were similar to those for Day 1 through Day 7. <span class="Bold">Figure 1</span> shows the mean change from baseline in SARS-COV-2 viral load over time.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1. Mean Change from Baseline in SARS-COV-2 Viral Load Over Time</span></p><p>While viral load was used to define the primary endpoint in the Phase 1/2 analysis, clinical evidence demonstrating that casirivimab and imdevimab may be effective came from the predefined secondary endpoint, medically attended visits (MAV) related to COVID-19. Medically attended visits comprised hospitalizations, emergency room visits, urgent care visits, or physician office/telemedicine visits for COVID-19. A lower proportion of subjects treated with casirivimab and imdevimab had COVID-19 related MAVs (2.8% for combined treatment arms vs 6.5% placebo). In post-hoc analyses, a lower proportion of subjects treated with casirivimab and imdevimab had COVID-19-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits compared to placebo, see Table 3. Results for this endpoint were suggestive of a relatively flat dose-response relationship. The absolute risk reduction for casirivimab and imdevimab compared to placebo was greater in subjects at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization, according to the criteria outlined in section 2 (Table 4).</p><p>The median time to symptom improvement, as recorded in a trial-specific daily symptom diary, was 5 days for casirivimab and imdevimab-treated subjects, as compared with 6 days for placebo-treated subjects.

Revised: 12/2020</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FACT SHEET FOR PATIENTS, PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS<br/>
EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA) OF CASIRIVIMAB AND IMDEVIMAB FOR CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019<br/>
(COVID-19)</span></p><p>You are being given a medicine called <span class="Bold">casirivimab</span> and <span class="Bold">imdevimab</span> for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This Fact Sheet contains information to help you understand the potential risks and potential benefits of taking casirivimab and imdevimab, which you may receive.</p><p>Receiving casirivimab and imdevimab may benefit certain people with COVID-19.</p><p>Read this Fact Sheet for information about casirivimab and imdevimab. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions. It is your choice to receive casirivimab and imdevimab or stop at any time.</p><p><span class="Bold">WHAT IS COVID-19?</span></p><p>COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. People can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.</p><p>COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can occur and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.</p><p><span class="Bold">WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19?</span></p><p>The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness including breathing problems can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.</p><p><span class="Bold">WHAT IS CASIRIVIMAB AND IMDEVIMAB?</span></p><p>Casirivimab and imdevimab are investigational medicines used to treat mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg)), and who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms or the need for hospitalization. Casirivimab and imdevimab are investigational because they are still being studied. There is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using casirivimab and imdevimab to treat people with COVID-19.</p><p>The FDA has authorized the emergency use of casirivimab and imdevimab for the treatment of COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). For more information on EUA, see the <span class="Bold">"What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?"</span> section at the end of this Fact Sheet.</p><p><span class="Bold">WHAT SHOULD I TELL MY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER BEFORE I RECEIVE CASIRIVIMAB AND IMDEVIMAB?</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</span></p><ul>
<li>Have any allergies</li>
<li>Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant</li>
<li>Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed</li>
<li>Have any serious illnesses</li>
<li>Are taking any medications (prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, and herbal products)</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">HOW WILL I RECEIVE CASIRIVIMAB AND IMDEVIMAB?</span></p><ul>
<li>Casirivimab and imdevimab are two investigational medicines given together as a single intravenous infusion (through a vein) for at least 1 hour.</li>
<li>You will receive one dose of casirivimab and imdevimab by intravenous infusion.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF CASIRIVIMAB AND IMDEVIMAB?</span></p><p>Possible side effects of casirivimab and imdevimab are:</p><ul>
<li>Allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can happen during and after infusion with casirivimab and imdevimab. Tell your healthcare provider or nurse, or get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of allergic reactions: fever, chills, low blood pressure, changes in your heartbeat, shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of your lips, face, or throat, rash including hives, itching, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating, muscle aches, dizziness and shivering.</li>
</ul><p>The side effects of getting any medicine by vein may include brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the infusion site.</p><p>These are not all the possible side effects of casirivimab and imdevimab. Not a lot of people have been given casirivimab and imdevimab. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. Casirivimab and imdevimab are still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time.</p><p>It is possible that casirivimab and imdevimab could interfere with your body's own ability to fight off a future infection of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, casirivimab and imdevimab may reduce your body's immune response to a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Specific studies have not been conducted to address these possible risks. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions.</p><p><span class="Bold">WHAT OTHER TREATMENT CHOICES ARE THERE?</span></p><p>Like casirivimab and imdevimab, FDA may allow for the emergency use of other medicines to treat people with COVID-19. Go to https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/ for information on other medicines used to treat people with COVID-19.</p><p>It is your choice to be treated or not to be treated with casirivimab and imdevimab. Should you decide not to receive casirivimab and imdevimab or stop it at any time, it will not change your standard medical care.</p><p><span class="Bold">WHAT IF I AM PREGNANT OR BREASTFEEDING?</span></p><p>There is limited experience treating pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers with casirivimab and imdevimab. For a mother and unborn baby, the benefit of receiving casirivimab and imdevimab may be greater than the risk from the treatment. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options and specific situation with your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">HOW DO I REPORT SIDE EFFECTS WITH CASIRIVIMAB AND IMDEVIMAB?</span></p><p>Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.</p><p>Report side effects to <span class="Bold">FDA MedWatch</span> at www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088 or call 1-844-734-6643.</p><p><span class="Bold">HOW CAN I LEARN MORE?</span></p><ul>
<li>Ask your health care provider.</li>
<li>Visit www.REGENCOV2.com</li>
<li>Visit https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/</li>
<li>Contact your local or state public health department.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA)?</span></p><p>The United States FDA has made casirivimab and imdevimab available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Casirivimab and imdevimab have not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The EUA for casirivimab and imdevimab is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of these products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used).</p><p>Manufactured by:<br/>
