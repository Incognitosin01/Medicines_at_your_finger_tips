Vedolizumab may also reduce the need for steroid medicines in helping to control symptoms long term.</p><p>Vedolizumab is usually given after other treatments have failed.</p><p>Vedolizumab may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b> vedolizumab can cause serious side effects on your brain or liver, and may cause a serious infection.</b> Call your doctor right away if you have a fever, tiredness, muscle aches, sore throat, shortness of breath, skin sores, painful urination, loss of appetite, upper stomach pain, dark urine, yellowing of your skin and eyes, or problems with speech, thought, vision, or muscle movement.</p><p>Tell your caregivers if you have any reactions during the injection, such as dizziness, nausea, itching, headache, chest tightness, trouble breathing, or swelling in your face.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use vedolizumab if you are allergic to it.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>

Tuberculosis and some fungal infections are more common in certain parts of the world, and you may have been exposed during travel.</p><p>You should be up to date with all needed vaccinations before receiving vedolizumab.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Having active UC or Crohn's disease during pregnancy may increase the risk of premature birth or low birth weight. The benefit of treating these conditions may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p><b>If you use vedolizumab while you are pregnant, make sure any doctor caring for your new baby knows that you used the medicine during pregnancy.</b> Being exposed to vedolizumab in the womb could affect your baby's vaccination schedule during the first few months of life.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of vedolizumab on the baby.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is vedolizumab given?</h2><p>Before you start treatment with vedolizumab, your doctor may perform tests to make sure you do not have tuberculosis or other infections.</p><p>Vedolizumab is given as an infusion into a vein, usually once every 2 to 8 weeks. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p> vedolizumab must be given slowly, and the infusion can take at least 30 minutes to complete.</p><p>You will be watched closely for a short time after receiving vedolizumab, to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction.</p><p>It may take up to several weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medication as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 14 weeks of treatment.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your vedolizumab injection.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  vedolizumab is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving vedolizumab?</h2><p>Do not receive a "live" vaccine while using vedolizumab, and avoid coming into contact with anyone who has recently received a live vaccine. There is a chance that the virus could be passed on to you. Live vaccines include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), rotavirus, typhoid, yellow fever, varicella (chickenpox), zoster (shingles), and nasal flu (influenza) vaccine.</p><p>You may receive "killed-virus" vaccines such as a flu shot, polio vaccine, rabies vaccine, or hepatitis A vaccine.
