Krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans which represent an important dietary link in the global food chain, being the main staple of hundreds of different animals, including fish, birds, and whales. Harvesting of krill oil is not without controversy and studies have suggested Antarctic krill stocks have fallen by 80% since 1970, which is a serious cause for concern.</p><p>Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil is a source of EPA and DHA omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but at a different ratio than fish oil. Krill oil has a ratio of 2:1 EPA to DHA, whereas fish oil has a ratio of 1:1 EPA to DHA. EPA is more effective than DHA at reducing cellular inflammation, and the more EPA in the diet, the less arachidonic acid there is available to produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.</p><p>Unlike omega-3’s found in fish oil which are bound to triglycerides, the omega-3’s in krill oil are bound to phospholipids, which reportedly improve absorption by 30 to 100%. Research has not yet determined if this conveys more health effects. However, more effective absorption does appear to reduce the incidence of side effects such as a fishy after taste or fishy burps, a common complaint with fish oils.</p><p>Krill oil also contains astaxanthin, a brightly colored carotenoid (a pigment that conveys color) that occurs naturally in algae, shrimp, lobster, crab, wild salmon, and krill. Astaxanthin provides an interface between water and fats and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties; although there have been few high-quality trials to test its benefits in people. Because it is so deeply colored, astaxanthin can make testing for contaminants or spoilage in krill oil difficult.</p><h2>Important Information</h2><p>Take Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take it in larger amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil should not be used in patients with a fish or shrimp allergy, or probably any other type of seafood allergy.</p><p>People with coagulopathy or taking anticoagulants or other medications should notify their physician prior to taking dietary supplements, including Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil.</p><p>Stop taking Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil at least two weeks prior to any scheduled surgery or procedure.</p><p>Swallow the Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil capsule whole. Do not puncture or open the capsule.</p><p>If you are taking Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil to improve cardiovascular function, then it should be part of a complete program of treatment that also includes diet, exercise, and weight control. Follow your diet, medication, and exercise routines very closely.</p><p>There may be other drugs that can interact with Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil. Tell your doctor about all medications you use. This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamin, and herbal products. Do not start a new medication without telling your doctor.</p><p>Stop using Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil and get emergency medical help if you think you have taken too much medicine, or if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Less serious side effects are more likely, and you may have none at all. Talk to your doctor about any side effect that seems unusual or is especially bothersome.</p><p>The manufacturers of Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil report it contains lower levels of contaminants or toxins than fish such as marlin, tuna, or swordfish. However, Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil may still contain methylmercury and other pollutants from seawater, such as organic pesticides, although levels are likely to be lower because krill are at a lower level in the food chain. </p><h2>Before taking Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil</h2><p>Do not use marine oils like Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil if you are allergic to fish, shrimp or any other type of seafood. Be sure to check the label on Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil package to look for other active or inactive ingredients that may cause an allergy.

<p>Talk with your health provider before taking Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil. Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil may interact with the following medications:</p><ul>
<li>Anticoagulants (blood thinners) or medications that slow blood clotting (such as aspirin, clopidogrel, diclofenac, ibuprofen, heparin, warfarin): Krill oil can also slow blood clotting</li>
<li>Diabetes medications for diabetes (such as insulin, glimepiride, glyburide): Krill oil may also lower blood sugar levels. Monitor blood sugar levels closely</li>

<h2>How Effective is Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil?</h2>
<p>Few studies have investigated the effect of Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil in humans, but animal studies have found some benefit for krill oil use in heart, liver, and kidney disease; inflammation; obesity; and brain function. How well animal studies extrapolate to humans is unknown.</p>
<p>Studies have found that supplements of krill oil are just as effective at raising blood levels of omega-3’s as fish oils are, and evidence shows omega-3s from fish-oil pills and fatty fish can reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p>
<p>Krill oil has shown to reduce pain, stiffness, loss of function, and inflammation in people with arthritis as measured by a protein in the blood, called C-reactive protein, or CRP.</p>
<p>Krill oil supplements were more effective at reducing self-reported emotional symptoms, breast tenderness, and joint pain than fish oil capsules in women with PMS. However, the study included two authors who worked for a company that sold krill Oil.</p>
<p>More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil for:</p><ul>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>High cholesterol</li>
<li>Osteoarthritis</li>
<li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
<li>or stroke.</li></ul>
<p>Experts suggest that taking krill oil supplements is no more beneficial than eating twice-weekly, fatty, low-mercury fish—such as Alaskan salmon and sardines. Nature's Bounty Red Krill Oil is a substantially more expensive source of EPA and DHA than fish or fish oil.</p>
