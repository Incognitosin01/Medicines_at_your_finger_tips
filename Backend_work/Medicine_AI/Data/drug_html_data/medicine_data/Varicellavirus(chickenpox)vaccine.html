Most people who receive this vaccine will not get chickenpox, or will get only a mild case and will recover faster.</p><p>Chickenpox is usually mild, but it can be serious or even fatal in young infants and in adults. It can lead to severe skin infection, breathing problems, brain damage, or death. A person who has had chickenpox can develop herpes zoster (also called shingles) later in life, which causes painful blisters, skin infections, severe nerve pain, and hearing or vision problems, which may last for months or years.</p><p>Chickenpox is spread from person to person through the air, or by coming into contact with the fluid from a chickenpox blister.</p><p>Varicella virus vaccine is used to help prevent these diseases in adults and children who are at least 12 months old.</p><p>This vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus or a protein from the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Like any vaccine, varicella virus vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. You should also not receive this vaccine if you have an infection or any illness with fever, active tuberculosis that is not being treated, or a weak immune system.</p><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you are pregnant. <b>Use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy for 1 to 3 months after receiving a varicella vaccine.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you are allergic to gelatin or neomycin, or if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing varicella.</p><p>You should also not receive this vaccine if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>an infection or any illness with fever;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>active tuberculosis that is not being treated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system caused by disease (such as cancer, HIV, or AIDS), or by receiving certain medicines such as steroids, chemotherapy or radiation; or</p>

</ul><p>an infection or any illness with fever;</p><p>active tuberculosis that is not being treated;</p><p>a weak immune system caused by disease (such as cancer, HIV, or AIDS), or by receiving certain medicines such as steroids, chemotherapy or radiation; or</p><p>if you are pregnant.</p><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you are pregnant. Chickenpox can cause birth defects, low birth weight, or a serious infection in the newborn, and this vaccine exposes you to a small amount of this virus. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant before you receive this vaccine. <b>Use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy for 1 to 3 months after receiving a varicella vaccine.</b></p><p>To make sure varicella vaccine is safe for you, tell your doctor if:</p><ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>someone in your household has a weak immune system; or</p>

</li>
</ul><p>you have a weak immune system;</p><p>someone in your household has a weak immune system; or</p><p>you have recently had a blood transfusion or have received an immune globulin or other blood products.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that you may continue to breast-feed a baby after you have received this vaccine.</p><h2>How is this vaccine given?</h2><p>This vaccine is given as an injection (shot) under the skin.

The booster dose may be given 3 months after the first, but may be delayed until the child is 4 to 6 years old.</p><p>People who are at least 13 years old and have never had chickenpox or received a varicella vaccine should receive 2 doses 4 to 8 weeks apart.</p><p>Your individual booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by your local health department.</p><p>This vaccine can cause false results on a skin test for tuberculosis. Tell any doctor who treats you if you have received a varicella virus vaccine within the past 4 to 6 weeks.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Contact your doctor if you will miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><p>Be sure to receive all recommended doses of this vaccine. You may not be fully protected against disease if you do not receive the full series.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after receiving this vaccine?</h2><p><b>For at least 6 weeks after receiving a varicella vaccine,</b> avoid coming into contact with newborn infants, pregnant women who have never had chickenpox, and anyone who has a weak immune system. There is a chance that you could pass the virus to a person with a weak immune system or no immunity to chickenpox.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">This vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b>: dizziness, weakness, fast heartbeats; hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>Becoming infected with chickenpox is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>high fever;</p>
