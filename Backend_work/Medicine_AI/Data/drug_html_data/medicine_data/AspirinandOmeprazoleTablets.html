</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Aspirin and Omeprazole Tablets</h2><p class="First">ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, a combination of aspirin and omeprazole, is indicated for patients who require aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and who are at risk of developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers.</p><p>The aspirin component of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is indicated for:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>reducing the combined risk of death and nonfatal stroke in patients who have had ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli,</li>
<li>reducing the combined risk of death and nonfatal MI in patients with a previous MI or unstable angina pectoris,</li>
<li>reducing the combined risk of MI and sudden death in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris,</li>
<li>use in patients who have undergone revascularization procedures (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft [CABG] or Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty [PTCA]) when there is a pre-existing condition for which aspirin is already indicated.</li>
</ul><p>The omeprazole component of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is indicated for decreasing the risk of developing aspirin-associated gastric ulcers in patients at risk for developing aspirin-associated gastric ulcers due to age (≥ 55) or documented history of gastric ulcers.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA contains a delayed-release formulation of aspirin and it is not for use as the initial dose of aspirin therapy during onset of acute coronary syndrome, acute myocardial infarction or before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), for which immediate-release aspirin therapy is appropriate.</li>
<li>ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA has not been shown to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to aspirin.</li>
<li>Do not substitute ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA with the single-ingredient products of aspirin and omeprazole.</li>
</ul><h2>Aspirin and Omeprazole Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Take one tablet daily.</li>
<li>ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is available in combinations that contain 81 mg or 325 mg of aspirin. Generally 81 mg of aspirin has been accepted as an effective dose for secondary cardiovascular prevention. Providers should consider the need for 325 mg and refer to current clinical practice guidelines.</li>
</ul><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Take ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA once daily at least 60 minutes before a meal.</li>
<li>The tablets are to be swallowed whole with liquid. Do not split, chew, crush or dissolve the tablet.</li>
<li>Use the lowest effective dose of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA based on the individual patient's treatment goals and to avoid potential dose dependent adverse reactions including bleeding.</li>
<li>If a dose of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is missed, advise patients to take it as soon as it is remembered. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose. Take the next dose at the regular time. Patients should not take 2 doses at the same time unless advised by their doctor.</li>
<li>Do not stop taking ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA suddenly as this could increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oval, blue-green, film-coated, delayed-release tablets for oral administration containing either:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>81 mg delayed-release aspirin and 40 mg immediate-release omeprazole, printed with 81/40, or</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is contraindicated in:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Patients with known allergy to aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products (NSAIDs) and in patients with the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Aspirin may cause severe urticaria, angioedema, or bronchospasm (asthma).</li>
<li>Pediatric patients with suspected viral infections, with or without fever, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome with concomitant use of aspirin in certain viral illnesses.</li>
<li>ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to aspirin, omeprazole, substituted benzimidazoles, or to any of the excipients in the formulation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></li>
<li>Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)–containing products, including ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, are contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Coagulation Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Even low doses of aspirin can inhibit platelet function leading to an increase in bleeding time. This can adversely affect patients with inherited (hemophilia) or acquired (liver disease or vitamin K deficiency) bleeding disorders. Monitor patients for signs of increased bleeding.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Aspirin is associated with serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions, including inflammation, bleeding ulceration and perforation of the upper and lower GI tract. Other adverse reactions with aspirin include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p>Serious GI adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA were: gastric ulcer hemorrhage in one of the 521 patients treated with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA and duodenal ulcer hemorrhage in one of the 524 patients treated with enteric-coated aspirin. In addition, there were two cases of intestinal hemorrhage, one in each treatment group, and one patient treated with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA experienced obstruction of the small bowel.</p><p>Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, monitor patients for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI adverse reactions.</p><p>If active and clinically significant bleeding from any source occurs in patients receiving ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, discontinue treatment.</p><h3>Bleeding Risk with Use of Alcohol</h3><p class="First">Counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA.</p><h3>Interaction with Clopidogrel</h3><p class="First">Avoid concomitant use of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as omeprazole, that interfere with CYP2C19 activity. Co-administration of clopidogrel with 80 mg omeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel, even when administered 12 hours apart. When using ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, consider alternative anti-platelet therapy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Interaction with Ticagrelor</h3><p class="First">Maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg reduce the effectiveness of ticagrelor in preventing thrombotic cardiovascular events. Avoid concomitant use of ticagrelor with the 325 mg/40 mg tablet strength of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Renal Failure</h3><p class="First">Avoid ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute). Regular use of aspirin is associated in a dose-dependent manner with an increased risk of chronic renal failure. Aspirin use decreases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow especially with patients with pre-existing renal disease. <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Presence of Gastric Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In adults, response to gastric symptoms with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional gastrointestinal follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who experience gastric symptoms during treatment with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA or have a symptomatic relapse after completing treatment. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.</p><h3>Acute Interstitial Nephritis</h3><p class="First">Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including omeprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA if acute interstitial nephritis develops <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Published observational studies suggest that PPI-containing therapy like ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA may be associated with an increased risk of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD), especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h3>Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Use the lowest dose and shortest duration of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Manage patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures according to established treatment guidelines <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First">Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including omeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.</p><p>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE), and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly.Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</p><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment, but some cases occurred days or years after initiating treatment. SLE occurred primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</p><p>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serologicial testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serologicial test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Long-term moderate to high doses of aspirin may result in elevations in serum ALT levels. These abnormalities resolve rapidly with discontinuation of aspirin. The hepatotoxicity of aspirin is usually mild and asymptomatic. Bilirubin elevations are usually mild or absent. Systemic exposure to omeprazole is increased in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Avoid ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</span></p><h3>Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA.</p><h3>Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA and periodically during treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Reduced Effect of Omeprazole with St. John's Wort or Rifampin</h3><p class="First">Drugs which induce the CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease concentrations of omeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA with St. John's Wort or rifampin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p class="First">Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to omeprazole-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic interventions for neuroendocrine tumors. Temporarily discontinue treatment with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><h3>Interaction with Methotrexate</h3><p class="First">Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA may be considered in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs including aspirin, may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester). <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Abnormal Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Aspirin has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, proteinuria, and prolonged bleeding time.</span></p><h3>Fundic Gland Polyps</h3><p class="First">PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA 325 mg/40 mg was studied primarily in two randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trials (n=524) of 6 months duration. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;2% of patients in the ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA arm and were more common than in the control arm, consisting of 325 mg of enteric coated (EC)-aspirin.</p><p>In Study 1 and Study 2 combined, 7% of patients taking ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 11% of patients taking EC-aspirin alone. The most common reasons for discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA treatment group were upper abdominal pain (&lt;1%, n=2), diarrhea (&lt;1%, n=2) and dyspepsia (&lt;1%, n=2).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Less Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>In ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA-treated patients in the clinical trials there were 2 patients with upper GI bleeding (gastric or duodenal) and 2 patients with lower GI bleeding (hematochezia and large intestinal hemorrhage) and one additional patient experienced obstruction in the small bowel.</p><p>See also the full prescribing information of aspirin and omeprazole products for additional adverse reactions.</p><h3>Post-Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of aspirin and omeprazole separately.

</ul><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Use of NSAIDs, including ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester). There are no available data with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associate risk for major birth defects and miscarriage; however, there are published studies with each individual component of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Aspirin</span></p><p>Data from controlled and observational studies with aspirin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with major birth defects or miscarriage risk.

Published data on aspirin use during pregnancy has been mostly reported with low dose aspirin (60 to 100 mg). There are limited data regarding aspirin 325 mg or higher doses used during pregnancy.</p><p>A prospective, cohort study of 50,282 mother-child pairs (the Collaborative Perinatal Project) assessing adverse outcomes by level of aspirin exposure did not report aspirin-induced teratogenicity, altered neonatal birth weight, or perinatal deaths at any exposure level. In a controlled, randomized trial, maternal risks during pregnancy were reported as low or absent, with no demonstrated increased risk of maternal bleeding or placental abruptio. A multinational study involving more than 9,000 women, CLASP (Collaborative Low-dose Aspirin Study in Pregnancy)], found that low-dose aspirin reduced fetal morbidity in a select population of women with early-onset preeclampsia, but did not identify adverse effects in the pregnant woman, fetus, or newborn (followed to 12 and 18 months of age) in association with the use of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy. In contrast, some case-control studies reported associations between human congenital malformations and aspirin use early in gestation, but these studies did not report a consistent outcome attributable to drug use.</p><p>A report from EAGeR trial (Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial), which evaluated 1078 women who were attempting to become pregnant and had prior miscarriages, reported use of low-dose aspirin without adverse maternal or fetal effects except for vaginal bleeding.

The differences in activity between aspirin and salicylic acid are thought to be due to the acetyl group on the aspirin molecule. This acetyl group is responsible for the inactivation of cyclo-oxygenase via acetylation.</p><p>Omeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the [H<span class="Sup">+</span>/K<span class="Sup">+</span>]-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Anti-platelet Activity</span></p><p>Aspirin affects platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet and prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating factor thromboxane A2. Nonacetylated salicylates do not inhibit this enzyme and have no effect on platelet aggregation. At higher doses, aspirin reversibly inhibits the formation of prostaglandin I<span class="Sub">2</span> (prostacyclin), which is an arterial vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antisecretory Activity</span></p><p>The effect of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA 325 mg/40 mg tablets on intragastric pH was determined in a study of 26 healthy subjects dosed for 7 days.

In comparison with histamine H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor antagonists, the median increases produced by 20 mg doses of omeprazole were higher (1.3 to 3.6 fold vs. 1.1 to 1.8 fold increase). Gastrin values returned to pretreatment levels, usually within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.</p><p>Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels.

The CYP2C19*1 allele is fully functional while the CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles are nonfunctional. There are other alleles associated with no or reduced enzymatic function. Patients carrying two fully functional alleles are extensive metabolizers and those carrying two loss-of-function alleles are poor metabolizers. In extensive metabolizers, omeprazole is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19. The systemic exposure to omeprazole varies with a patient's metabolism status: poor metabolizers &gt; intermediate metabolizers &gt; extensive metabolizers. Approximately 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.</p><p>In a pharmacokinetic study of single 20 mg omeprazole dose, the AUC of omeprazole in Asian subjects was approximately four-fold of that in Caucasians <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Studies to evaluate the potential effects of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA on carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility have not been conducted.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Aspirin</span></p><p>Administration of aspirin for 68 weeks at 0.5% in the feed of rats was not carcinogenic.</p><p>In the Ames Salmonella assay, aspirin was not mutagenic; however, aspirin did induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts.</p><p>Aspirin inhibits ovulation in rats.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Omeprazole</span></p><p>In two 24-month carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44.0 and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.35 to 34 times the human dose of 40 mg per day, based on body surface area) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 times the human dose of 40 mg per day, based on body surface area) for one year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of one year (94% treated vs 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for two years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. In a 52-week toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, brain astrocytomas were found in a small number of males that received omeprazole at dose levels of 0.4, 2, and 16 mg/kg/day (about 0.1 to 3.2 times the human dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area).
