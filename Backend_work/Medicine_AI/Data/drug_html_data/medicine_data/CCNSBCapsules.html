(lomustine)<br/>
Capsules</span></p><p class="First">CCNSB (lomustine) should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p>Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of CCNSB (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><p>Since the major toxicity is delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). At the recommended dosage, courses of CCNSB should not be given more frequently than every 6 weeks.</p><p>The bone marrow toxicity of CCNSB is cumulative and therefore dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose (see dosage adjustment table under <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">CCNSB<span class="Sup">TM</span> (lomustine) (CCNU) is one of the nitrosoureas used in the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases. It is 1-(2-chloro-ethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea. It is a yellow powder with the empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">9</span>H<span class="Sub">16</span>ClN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span> and a molecular weight of 233.71. CCNSB is soluble in 10% ethanol (0.05 mg per mL) and in absolute alcohol (70 mg per mL). CCNSB is relatively insoluble in water (&lt;0.05 mg per mL).</p><p>It is relatively un-ionized at a physiological pH.</p><p>Inactive ingredients in CCNSB Capsules are magnesium stearate and mannitol.</p><p>The structural formula is:</p><p>CCNSB is available in 10 mg, 40 mg, and 100 mg capsules for oral administration.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Although it is generally agreed that CCNSB alkylates DNA and RNA, it is not cross resistant with other alkylators. As with other nitrosoureas, it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins.</p><p>CCNSB may be given orally. Following oral administration of radioactive CCNSB at doses ranging from 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> to 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, about half of the radioactivity given was excreted in the urine in the form of degradation products within 24 hours.</p><p>The serum half-life of the metabolites ranges from 16 hours to 2 days. Tissue levels are comparable to plasma levels at 15 minutes after intravenous administration.</p><p>Because of the high lipid solubility and the relative lack of ionization at physiological pH, CCNSB crosses the blood-brain barrier quite effectively. Levels of radioactivity in the CSF are 50% or greater than those measured concurrently in plasma.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">CCNSB has been shown to be useful as a single agent in addition to other treatment modalities, or in established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in the following:</p><p><span class="Bold">Brain tumors</span>—both primary and metastatic, in patients who have already received appropriate surgical and/or radiotherapeutic procedures.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hodgkin's disease</span>—secondary therapy in combination with other approved drugs in patients who relapse while being treated with primary therapy, or who fail to respond to primary therapy.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">CCNSB should not be given to individuals who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity to it.</p><h2>WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Since the major toxicity is delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). At the recommended dosage, courses of CCNSB should not be given more frequently than every 6 weeks.</p><p>The bone marrow toxicity of CCNSB is cumulative and therefore dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose (see dosage adjustment table under <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>Pulmonary toxicity from CCNSB appears to be dose related (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><p>Long-term use of nitrosoureas has been reported to be possibly associated with the development of secondary malignancies.</p><p>Liver and renal function tests should be monitored periodically (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><h3>Pregnancy Category D</h3><p class="First">CCNSB can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. CCNSB is embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and embryotoxic in rabbits at dose levels equivalent to the human dose. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking (receiving) this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">In all instances where the use of CCNSB is considered for chemotherapy, the physician must evaluate the need and usefulness of the drug against the risks of toxic effects or adverse reactions. Most such adverse reactions are reversible if detected early. When such effects or reactions do occur, the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken according to the clinical judgment of the physician. Reinstitution of CCNSB therapy should be carried out with caution and with adequate consideration of the further need for the drug and alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Provide patients with the following information and instructions:</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Due to delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose.</p><p>Baseline pulmonary function studies should be conducted along with frequent pulmonary function tests during treatment. Patients with a baseline below 70% of the predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) or Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DL<span class="Sub">CO</span>) are particularly at risk.</p><p>Since CCNSB may cause liver dysfunction, it is recommended that liver function tests be monitored periodically.</p><p>Renal function tests should also be monitored periodically.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">CCNSB is carcinogenic in rats and mice, producing a marked increase in tumor incidence in doses approximating those employed clinically. Nitrosourea therapy does have carcinogenic potential in humans (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). CCNSB also affects fertility in male rats at doses somewhat higher than the human dose.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from CCNSB, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pulmonary Toxicity</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No data from clinical studies of CCNSB are available for patients 65 years of age and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Lomustine and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function should be monitored.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">The most frequent and most serious toxicity of CCNSB is delayed myelosuppression. It usually occurs 4 to 6 weeks after drug administration and is dose related. Thrombocytopenia occurs at about 4 weeks postadministration and persists for 1 to 2 weeks. Leukopenia occurs at 5 to 6 weeks after a dose of CCNSB and persists for 1 to 2 weeks. Approximately 65% of patients receiving 130 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> develop white blood counts below 5000 wbc/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. Thirty-six percent developed white blood counts below 3000 wbc/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. Thrombocytopenia is generally more severe than leukopenia. However, both may be dose-limiting toxicities.</p><p><span class="Bold">CCNSB may produce cumulative myelosuppression, manifested by more depressed indices or longer duration of suppression after repeated doses.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">The occurrence of acute leukemia and bone marrow dysplasias have been reported in patients following long-term nitrosourea therapy.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Anemia also occurs, but is less frequent and less severe than thrombocytopenia or leukopenia.</span></p><h3>Pulmonary Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary toxicity characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and/or fibrosis has been reported rarely with CCNSB. Onset of toxicity has occurred after an interval of 6 months or longer from the start of therapy with cumulative doses of CCNSB usually greater than 1100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. There is 1 report of pulmonary toxicity at a cumulative dose of only 600 mg.</p><p>Delayed onset pulmonary fibrosis occurring up to 17 years after treatment has been reported in patients who received related nitrosoureas in childhood and early adolescence (1–16 years) combined with cranial radiotherapy for intracranial tumors. There appeared to be some late reduction of pulmonary function of all long-term survivors. This form of lung fibrosis may be slowly progressive and has resulted in death in some cases. In this long-term study of carmustine, all those initially treated at less than 5 years of age died of delayed pulmonary fibrosis.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Nausea and vomiting may occur 3 to 6 hours after an oral dose and usually last less than 24 hours. Prior administration of antiemetics is effective in diminishing and sometimes preventing this side effect. Nausea and vomiting can also be reduced if CCNSB is administered to fasting patients.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">A reversible type of hepatic toxicity, manifested by increased transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels, has been reported in a small percentage of patients receiving CCNSB.</p><h3>Nephrotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Renal abnormalities consisting of progressive azotemia, decrease in kidney size, and renal failure have been reported in patients who received large cumulative doses after prolonged therapy with CCNSB. Kidney damage has also been reported occasionally in patients receiving lower total doses.</p><h3>Other Toxicities</h3><p class="First">Stomatitis, alopecia, optic atrophy, and visual disturbances, such as blindness, have been reported infrequently.</p><p>Neurological reactions, such as disorientation, lethargy, ataxia, and dysarthria have been noted in some patients receiving CCNSB. However, the relationship to medication in these patients is unclear.</p><p><span class="Bold">Talk to your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to NextSource Biotechnology at 855-NSB-2468 (855-672-2468) or to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 (1-800-332-1088) or at www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">Accidental overdose with lomustine has been reported, including fatal cases. Accidental overdose has been associated with bone marrow suppression, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, dizziness, abnormal hepatic function, cough, and shortness of breath.</p><p>No proven antidotes have been established for CCNSB overdosage. In case of overdose, appropriate supportive measures should be taken.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">The recommended dose of CCNSB in adult and pediatric patients as a single agent in previously untreated patients is 130 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> as a single oral dose every 6 weeks (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients</span> and <span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED: Directions to the Pharmacist</span>). In individuals with compromised bone marrow function, the dose should be reduced to 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 6 weeks. When CCNSB is used in combination with other myelosuppressive drugs, the doses should be adjusted accordingly. All doses of CCNSB must be rounded to the nearest 10 mg by the prescriber (see <span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED).</span></p><p>Doses subsequent to the initial dose should be adjusted according to the hematologic response of the patient to the preceding dose. The following schedule is suggested as a guide to dosage adjustment:</p><p><span class="Bold">A repeat course of CCNSB should not be given until circulating blood elements have returned to acceptable levels (platelets above 100,000/mm</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">3</span></span><span class="Bold">; leukocytes above 4000/mm</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">3</span></span><span class="Bold">), and this is usually in 6 weeks. Adequate number of neutrophils should be present on a peripheral blood smear. Blood counts should be monitored weekly and repeat courses should not be given before 6 weeks because the hematologic toxicity is delayed and cumulative.</span></p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">CCNSB<span class="Sup">TM</span> (lomustine) Capsules are available in individual bottles of 5 capsules each.</p><h3>Stability</h3><p class="First">CCNSB Capsules are stable for the lot life indicated on package labeling when stored in well-closed containers at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C–30°C (59°F–86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Avoid excessive heat (over 40°C, 104°F).</p><h3>Directions to the Pharmacist</h3><p class="First">Confirm the total dose prescribed by the physician can be obtained by determining the appropriate combination of capsule strengths. Only the appropriate number of CCNSB Capsules required for the administration of a single dose should be dispensed.</p><p>In order to provide the proper dose of CCNSB, patients should be aware that the prescribed dose may be made up of 2 or more different strengths and colors of capsules and that each strength must be dispensed separately. Inform patients that CCNSB is taken as a single oral dose and will not be repeated for at least 6 weeks. Daily use of the recommended dose may lead to toxicities and fatal outcomes.</p><p>Caution should be exercised when handling CCNSB Capsules. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be utilized. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.<span class="Sup">1-4</span> To minimize the risk of dermal exposure, always wear impervious gloves when handling bottles containing CCNSB Capsules. CCNSB Capsules should not be broken. Personnel should avoid exposure to broken capsules. If contact occurs, wash immediately and thoroughly.
