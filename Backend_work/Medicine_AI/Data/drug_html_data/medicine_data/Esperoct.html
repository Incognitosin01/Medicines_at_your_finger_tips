To administer Esperoct through incompatible needleless connectors, withdraw the reconstituted product into a standard 10 mL sterile Luer-lock plastic syringe.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Esperoct is available as a sterile white to off-white lyophilized powder supplied in single-dose vials containing nominally 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 or 3000 IU. The actual FVIII activity is printed on each Esperoct vial and carton.</p><p>After reconstitution with 4 mL of saline diluent, the reconstituted solution contains approximately 125, 250, 375, 500 or 750 IU per mL of Esperoct, respectively.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Esperoct is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to Esperoct or its components (including hamster proteins) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Description (11)</span>].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with Esperoct. The product contains traces of hamster proteins, which in some patients may cause allergic reactions [<span class="Italics">see Description (11</span>)]. Early signs of allergic reactions, which can progress to anaphylaxis, may include angioedema, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, wheezing, rash, hives, and itching. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of exposure to the product. Discontinue use of Esperoct if allergic- or anaphylactic-type reactions occur, and initiate appropriate treatment.</p><h3>Neutralizing Antibodies</h3><p class="First">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to Factor VIII has occurred following administration of Esperoct. Monitor patients for the development of Factor VIII inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If expected Factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled after Esperoct administration, suspect the presence of an inhibitor (neutralizing antibody) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>].</p><h3>Monitoring Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">If monitoring of Factor VIII is performed, use a chromogenic or one-stage clotting assay appropriate for use with Esperoct [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2</span>)].</p><p>Factor VIII activity levels can be affected by the type of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) reagent used in the assay. Some silica-based aPTT reagents can underestimate the activity of Esperoct by up to 60%; other reagents may overestimate the activity by 20%. If an appropriate one-stage clotting or chromogenic assay is not available locally, then use a reference laboratory.</p><p>If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose of Esperoct or if the expected Factor VIII activity levels in plasma are not attained, then perform a Bethesda assay to determine if Factor VIII inhibitors are present.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) in clinical trials were rash, redness, itching (pruritus), and injection site reactions.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety of Esperoct has been evaluated in 270 subjects (202 adolescents/adults and 68 children) in five prospective, multi-center clinical studies in previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe hemophilia A (&lt;1% endogenous Factor VIII activity) and no history of inhibitors. All subjects received at least one dose of Esperoct. A previously treated patient was defined as a subject with a history of at least 150 exposure days to other Factor VIII products (adolescent/adult subjects) or 50 exposure days to other Factor VIII products (pediatric subjects). Total exposure to Esperoct was 80,425 exposure days corresponding to 889 patient years of treatment.</p><p>During the clinical trials in PTPs, adverse reactions occurred at a rate of 0.10 events per patient year of exposure. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were rash (5.2%), injection site reaction (2.6%), redness (1.9%), and itching (pruritus) (1.5%).</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">Subjects were monitored for neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies to Factor VIII, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and CHO host cell protein. One previously treated subject developed confirmed neutralizing antibodies to Factor VIII (13.5 Bethesda Units). In addition, two subjects had transient low titer FVIII antibody (&lt;5 Bethesda Units) test results at a single occasion. Anti-PEG antibodies of no clinical consequence were detected in 45 subjects, 32 of whom had pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies. Nine subjects developed anti-CHO host cell protein antibodies of no clinical consequence.</p><p>The detection of antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no data with Esperoct use in pregnant women to determine whether there is a drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Esperoct. It is unknown whether Esperoct can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect fertility.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of Esperoct in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, and the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Esperoct and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Esperoct or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy were evaluated in 93 previously treated pediatric patients &lt;18 years of age, who received at least one dose of Esperoct; all received routine prophylaxis [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)</span>]. Thirty-four (34) of these subjects (36.6%) were 1 to &lt;6 years of age; 34 subjects (36.6%) were 6 to &lt;12 years of age; and 25 subjects (27%) were 12 to &lt;18 years of age. Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated for 27 of these subjects who were treated with Esperoct [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>No difference in the safety profile of Esperoct was observed between previously treated pediatric subjects and adult subjects. Pharmacokinetic studies in children &lt;12 years of age demonstrated higher clearance, a shorter half-life, and lower incremental recovery of Factor VIII compared to adults, but the pharmacokinetic parameters are comparable between young children (1–&lt;6 years) and older children (6–&lt;12 years). Because clearance (per kg body weight) is higher in children (&lt;12 years), a higher dose and more frequent dosing may be needed in this population [<span class="Italics">see</span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Esperoct did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 years and over to determine whether or not they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease and other drug therapy.</p><h2>Esperoct Description</h2><p class="First">Esperoct is a sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic lyophilized powder for intravenous injection after reconstitution with the provided saline diluent. The active ingredient in Esperoct is a recombinant analogue of human coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII) conjugated with a 40-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. Esperoct is formulated with the following excipients: sodium chloride, L-histidine, sucrose, polysorbate 80, L-methionine, and calcium chloride.</p><p>FVIII activity in Esperoct is determined using the chromogenic assay described in the European Pharmacopoeia. The activity assignment employs a FVIII reference material that is traceable to the current World Health Organization (WHO) international standard for FVIII concentrate, and evaluated by appropriate methodologies to ensure the accuracy of the results. Esperoct is available in single-dose vials that contain nominally 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, or 3000 IU of FVIII. Each vial of Esperoct is labeled with the actual FVIII activity. After reconstitution with the supplied diluent (0.9% saline), each mL of the solution contains approximately 125, 250, 375, 500, or 750 IU of FVIII, respectively.</p><p>The FVIII protein in Esperoct is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology, and contains a truncated B domain, which is O-glycosylated. The polypeptide part of the molecule has a molecular mass of 166 kDa (calculated excluding post-translational modifications) and represents a heterodimer of a heavy chain and a light chain, which are held together by non-covalent interactions. The recombinant FVIII protein is purified using a series of chromatographic steps, one of which is affinity chromatography, with the use of a monoclonal antibody to selectively isolate the rFVIII from the cell culture medium. The 40-kDa PEG molecule is conjugated to the O-glycan moiety of the B domain using an enzymatic reaction to produce a glycopegylated FVIII (FVIII-PEG). The purification process includes two viral clearance steps, namely detergent (Triton X-100) treatment for inactivation of enveloped viruses, and 20-nm filtration for removal of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. No additives of human or animal origin are used during the manufacturing process and formulation of Esperoct.</p><p>In the blood circulation, when FVIII-PEG is activated by thrombin, the B-domain portion with the attached PEG moiety is cleaved off, and the resulting activated FVIII (FVIIIa) is similar in structure and function to native FVIIIa.</p><h2>Esperoct - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Esperoct, a glycopegylated form of recombinant anti-hemophilic factor, temporarily replaces the missing coagulation Factor VIII needed for effective hemostasis in congenital hemophilia A patients. The Factor VIII in Esperoct is conjugated to a 40-kDa polyethylene glycol molecule which increases the half-life and decreases the clearance compared to the non-pegylated molecule.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The administration of Esperoct increases plasma levels of Factor VIII and can temporarily correct the coagulation defect in hemophilia A patients, as reflected by a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">All pharmacokinetic studies with Esperoct were conducted in previously treated subjects with severe hemophilia A (Factor VIII&lt;1%). In total, 129 single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of Esperoct were evaluated in 86 subjects (including 24 pediatric subjects, 1–&lt;12 years).</p><p>Table 3 shows data for subjects who each received a single dose of 50 IU/kg. The plasma samples were analyzed using the one-stage clotting assay. There was a trend of increasing incremental recovery and AUC, and decreasing clearance, with age.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Single-dose PK parameters of Esperoct 50 IU/kg, by age, using one-stage clotting assay (geometric mean (CV%))</span></p><p class="First">No. of profiles</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">10</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">78</p><p class="First">IR (IU/dL) per IU/kg)<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">1.82 (32)</p><p class="First">1.67 (22)</p><p class="First">2.45 (16)</p><p class="First">2.53 (24)</p><p class="First">FVIII recovery (IU/dL)<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">103.2 (27)</p><p class="First">98.7 (18)</p><p class="First">117.7 (14)</p><p class="First">130.4 (26)</p><p class="First">t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> (hours)</p><p class="First">14.7 (27)</p><p class="First">13.8 (32)</p><p class="First">17.4 (39)</p><p class="First">21.7 (33)</p><p class="First">AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> (IU*hour/dL)</p><p class="First">2305 (42)</p><p class="First">2197 (38)</p><p class="First">3063 (40)</p><p class="First">4110 (38)</p><p class="First">CL (mL/hour/kg)</p><p class="First">2.4 (42)</p><p class="First">2.7 (42)</p><p class="First">1.6 (39)</p><p class="First">1.2 (34)</p><p class="First">Vss (mL/kg)</p><p class="First">44.2 (25)</p><p class="First">47.3 (28)</p><p class="First">36.4 (12)</p><p class="First">37.3 (26)</p><p class="First">MRT (hours)</p><p class="First">18.1 (27)</p><p class="First">17.8 (35)</p><p class="First">23.4 (43)</p><p class="First">27.4 (28)<span class="Sup">b</span></p><p>PK parameters are presented in geometric mean.</p><p>Abbreviations: IR = Incremental recovery; t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> = terminal half-life; AUC = area under the FVIII activity time profile; CL = clearance; Vss = volume of distribution at steady-state; MRT = mean residence time; CV% = coefficient of variation</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span> IR and FVIII recovery were assessed 30 minutes post-dosing 50 IU/kg for patients ≥12 years and 60 minutes post-dosing 50 IU/kg (first sample) for children &lt;12 years.</p><p><span class="Sup">b</span> Calculation based on 64 profiles.</p><p>In the single-dose PK assessment in adult subjects, whose body mass index (BMI) ranged from 17-35 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, differences were noted for individuals who were overweight (BMI 25 - &lt;30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and obese (BMI 30 - &lt;35 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).

During post-operative days 1-6, the median dose was 32 IU/kg at approximately 24 hour intervals. During post-operative days 7-14, the median dose was 36 IU/kg at approximately 28 hour intervals. The number of doses and duration of treatment varied by procedure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Routine Prophylaxis in Adolescents/Adults</span></p><p>The efficacy of Esperoct in routine prophylaxis with Q4D dosing was demonstrated for the adult/adolescent population (see Table 7). In the extension part of the study, treatment success of the Q7D arm was not established. During the Main Phase of the adolescent/adult trial, 186 subjects had a total of 159 exposure years. The median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) for treated bleeds in adults and adolescents treated every 4 days was 1.2 (IQR: 0.0:4.3), and mean ABR was 3.0 (SD: 4.7).
