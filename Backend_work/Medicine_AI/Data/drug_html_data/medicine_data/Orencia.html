The immune system helps your body fight infections. In people with autoimmune disorders, the immune system mistakes the body's own cells for invaders and attacks them.</p><p>Orencia is a prescription medicine used to treat symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and to prevent joint damage caused by these conditions. This medicine is for adults and children at least 2 years old.</p><p>Orencia is also used to treat active psoriatic arthritis in adults.</p><p>Orencia is not a cure for any autoimmune disorder and will only treat the symptoms of your condition.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before using Orencia, tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis (TB), if anyone in your household has tuberculosis, or if you have recently traveled to an area where tuberculosis is common.</p><p>Also tell your doctor if you have a weak immune system, any type of infection (including skin infection or open sores), COPD, diabetes, a history of hepatitis, or if you have scheduled to receive any vaccinations.</p><p>Children using this medication should be current on all childhood immunizations before starting treatment with Orencia.

Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Orencia must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. When using injections by yourself, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Gently swirl but do not shake the medication bottle.
