</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Jadelle</h2><p>Jadelle® is a set of 2 hormone-releasing birth control implants that are surgically placed and removed under the skin of the upper arm by a trained healthcare provider. The implants are placed in the upper arm for up to 5 years.</p><p>The implants are usually inserted by your doctor within the first 7 days of your regular menstrual period. Your doctor also needs to do a pregnancy test before inserting the implants.</p><p>After the implants are inserted, your doctor should feel your arm to check that the implants are in the right place. If you cannot feel the implants in your arm, you will need to use a non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms, spermicide) until your doctor confirms that the implants are in place.</p><p>Your doctor will cover the insertion site with a gauze bandage. Keep it dry and avoid heavy lifting for 2 to 3 days. The gauze may be removed after 1 to 3 days.</p><p>Do not try to remove the implants by yourself. Call your doctor if you wish to remove your implants.</p><p>Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine.</p><p>This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Jadelle</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure this medicine is working properly and does not cause unwanted effects.</p><p>Infection at the insertion site may occur following insertion and removal of the implants. It is important to tell your doctor if you feel any pain, numbness, or tingling in your upper arm.</p><p>Call your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant while you are using this medicine. You may have a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy if you get pregnant while your implants are in place. An ectopic pregnancy can be a serious and life-threatening condition. It can also cause problems that may make it harder for you to become pregnant in the future.</p><p>You could have less bleeding or even stop having periods by the end of the first year. Call your doctor if you have a change from the regular bleeding pattern after you have had your implants for awhile, such as more bleeding or if you miss a period (and you were having periods even with your implants).</p><p>This device will not protect you from getting HIV/AIDS, herpes, or other sexually transmitted diseases. Tell your doctor if you or your partner begin to have sexual intercourse with other people, or you or your partner tests positive for a sexually transmitted disease. If this is a concern for you, talk with your doctor.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.</p><p>This medicine may cause changes in your blood sugar levels. Also, this medicine may cover up signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid pulse rate. Check with your doctor if you have these problems or if you notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests.</p><p>Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using this medicine. You may need to stop using this medicine several days before you have surgery or medical tests.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Jadelle side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
