A key difference between the two drugs is that Evrysdi is taken orally, whereas Spinraza needs to be given via intrathecal injection. Continue reading</p><p>Evrysdi (risdiplam) works by targeting the SMN2 gene (survival motor neuron gene 2), causing it to make more functional SMN protein. This increases SMN protein levels throughout the central nervous system and body, helping to improve motor nerve and muscle function in children and adults with SMA. Continue reading</p><p>At least four major trials have reported that Evrysdi significantly improves survival motor neuron (SMN)  protein levels in children and adults with SMA, allowing an increase in muscle strength and the achievement of milestones, such as being able to sit independently for 5 or more seconds at a time.
