</ul><h2>Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> (nedocromil sodium) is an inhaled anti-inflammatory agent for the preventive management of asthma. Nedocromil sodium is a pyranoquinoline with the chemical name 4<span class="Italics">H</span> -Pyrano[3,2-<span class="Italics">g</span>]quinoline-2,8-dicarboxylic acid, 9-ethyl-6,9-dihydro-4,6-dioxo-10- propyl-, disodium salt, and it has a molecular weight of 415.3. The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>NNa<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">7</span>. Nedocromil sodium, a yellow powder, is soluble in water.</p><p>The molecular structure of nedocromil sodium is:</p><p></p><p><span class="Bold">Chemical Class:</span> Pyranoquinoline</p><p><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler (nedocromil sodium inhalation aerosol) is a pressurized metered-dose aerosol suspension for oral inhalation containing micronized nedocromil sodium and sorbitan trioleate, as well as dichlorotetrafluoro ethane and dichlorodifluoromethane as propellants. Each <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> canister contains 210 mg nedocromil sodium. Each actuation meters 2.00 mg nedocromil sodium from the valve and delivers 1.75 mg nedocromil sodium from the mouthpiece. Each 16.2 g canister provides at least 104 metered actuations. <span class="Bold">After 104 metered actuations, the amount delivered per actuation may not be consistent and the unit should be discarded.</span></p><p>Each <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler canister must be primed with 3 actuations prior to the first use. If a canister remains unused for more than 7 days, then it should be reprimed with 3 actuations.</p><h2>Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> Nedocromil sodium has been shown to inhibit the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> activation of, and mediator release from, a variety of inflammatory cell types associated with asthma, including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, monocytes, and platelets. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies on cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from antigen-sensitized macaque monkeys show that nedocromil sodium inhibits the release of mediators including histamine, leukotriene C<span class="Sub">4</span>, and prostaglandin D<span class="Sub">2</span>. Similar studies with human bronchoalveolar cells showed inhibition of histamine release from mast cells and beta-glucuronidase release from macrophages.</p><p>Nedocromil sodium has been tested in experimental models of asthma using allergic animals and shown to inhibit the development of early and late bronchoconstriction responses to inhaled antigen. The development of airway hyper-responsiveness to nonspecific bronchoconstrictors was also inhibited. Nedocromil sodium reduced antigen-induced increases in airway microvasculature leakage when administered intravenously in a model system.</p><p>In humans, nedocromil sodium has been shown to inhibit acutely the bronchoconstrictor response to several kinds of challenge. Pretreatment with single doses of nedocromil sodium inhibited the bronchoconstriction caused by sulfur dioxide, inhaled neurokinin A, various antigens, exercise, cold air, fog, and adenosine monophosphate.</p><p>Nedocromil sodium has no bronchodilator, antihistamine, or corticosteroid activity.</p><p>Nedocromil sodium, when delivered by inhalation at the recommended dose, has no known systemic activity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability:</span> Systemic bioavailability of nedocromil sodium administered as an inhaled aerosol is low. In a single dose study involving 20 healthy adult subjects who were administered a 3.5 mg dose of nedocromil sodium (2 actuations of 1.75 mg each), the mean AUC was 5.0 ng-hr/mL and the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 1.6 ng/mL attained about 28 minutes after dosing. The mean half-life was 3.3 hours. Urinary excretion over 12 hours averaged 3.4% of the administered dose, of which approximately 75% was excreted in the first six hours of dosing.</p><p>In a multiple dose study, six healthy adult volunteers (3 males and 3 females) received a 3.5 mg single dose followed by 3.5 mg four times a day for seven consecutive days. Accumulation of the drug was not observed. Following single and multiple dose inhalations, urinary excretion of nedocromil accounted for 5.6% and 12% of the drug administered, respectively. After intravenous administration to healthy adults, urinary excretion of nedocromil was approximately 70%. The absolute bioavailability of nedocromil was thus 8% (5.6/70) for single and 17% (12/70) for multiple inhaled doses.</p><p>Similarly, in a multiple dose study of 12 asthmatic adult patients, each given a 3.5 mg single dose followed by 3.5 mg four times a day for one month, both single dose and multiple dose inhalations gave a mean high plasma concentration of 2.8 ng/mL between 5 and 90 minutes, mean AUC of 5.6 ng-hr/mL, and a mean terminal half-life of 1.5 hours. The mean 24-hour urinary excretion after either single or multiple dose administration represented approximately 5% of the administered dose.</p><p>Studies involving very high oral doses of nedocromil (600 mg single dose, and subsequently 200 mg three times a day for seven days) showed an absolute bioavailability of less than 2%. In a radiolabeled (<span class="Sup">14</span>C) nedocromil intravenous study involving two healthy adult males, urinary excretion accounted for 64% of the dose, fecal excretion for 36%.</p><p>Although minimal pharmacokinetic data are available in children between the ages of 6 and 11 years, the nedocromil sodium levels obtained at 1 hour after chronic dosing in this age group appear to be similar to those observed in adults.</p><p><span class="Italics">Protein Binding:</span> Nedocromil is approximately 89% protein bound in human plasma over a concentration range of 0.5 to 50µg/mL. This binding is reversible.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span> Nedocromil is not metabolized after IV administration and is excreted unchanged.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The worldwide clinical trial experience with <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> comprises 6,469 patients, including 993 pediatric patients 6 through 11 years of age. Studies have been conducted both at twice daily and at four times daily dosage regimens. Evidence from these studies indicates that the four times daily regimen has been more effective than the twice daily regimen. Less frequent administration can be considered in patients under good control on the four times daily regimen. (See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>.)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Studies:</span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> vs. Placebo:</span> The effectiveness of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> given four times daily was examined in a 14-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in five centers in 120 patients (60/treatment). To be eligible for entry, the asthmatic patients had to be controlled using only sustained-release theophylline (SRT) and beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists. Two weeks after the test therapies were begun the SRT was discontinued and four weeks after that oral beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists were stopped. Beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist metered dose inhalers could still be used after 6 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by symptom scores recorded on diary cards completed on a daily basis by the patients. Each morning the patient recorded nighttime asthma on a 0–2 scale, (0=slept well, no asthma; 1=woke once because of asthma; 2=woke more than once because of asthma). Before bedtime the patients recorded daytime asthma and cough on a 0–5 scale (0=no symptoms of asthma/cough today; 5=asthma/cough symptoms were noticed most of the day and caused a lot of trouble). At the end of the treatment phase, patients and clinicians were asked for their opinions on the effectiveness of the treatment based on a five point scale (1=very effective; 5=made condition worse). The results of these evaluations are shown in Table 1; <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> was significantly superior to placebo for all measurements.</p><p>The FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> percentage change relative to baseline is shown in Figure 1; these also favored <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> over placebo throughout the study, with an effect seen first at the two week measurement.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1</span></p><p></p><p>This study shows that <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> improves symptom control and pulmonary function when it is added to an as-needed inhaled beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic bronchodilator regimen and that a beneficial effect could be detected within two weeks.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> vs. Cromolyn Sodium vs. Placebo:</span> The effectiveness of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> was compared to cromolyn sodium and placebo in an eight-week, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-center trial during which medication was given four times daily. Three hundred and six patients were randomized to treatment (103/<span class="Bold">Tilade</span>; 104/cromolyn sodium; 99/placebo). All patients were SRT dependent and this drug was stopped prior to starting the test treatment. Efficacy was assessed on the basis of diary card symptom scores and FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>. The diary scores were the same as used in the 14-week study except that nighttime symptoms were recorded on a 0–3 scale. The primary efficacy variable was a summary symptom score derived by averaging the scores for daytime asthma, nighttime asthma, and cough. The results of the study are shown in Table 2.</p><p>This study corroborates the findings of the 14-week study, showing that <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> is effective in the management of symptoms and pulmonary function in primarily atopic mild to moderate asthmatics. Both active treatments were statistically significantly better than placebo for the primary efficacy variable (summary symptom score); <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> and cromolyn sodium were not significantly different for this parameter. A statistically significant difference favoring cromolyn sodium was, however, seen for nighttime asthma and FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>.</p><p>In allergic asthmatics who are well controlled on cromolyn sodium, there is no evidence that the substitution of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> for cromolyn sodium would confer additional benefit to the patient.</p><p>Available data on the relative efficacy of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> and cromolyn sodium are inconclusive and efficacy with one agent is not known to be predictive of efficacy with the other.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Studies:</span> <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> vs. Placebo in Pediatric Patients</span>: The effectiveness of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> in minimizing the anticipated seasonal increase in asthmatic symptoms in pediatric patients 6 through 11 years of age with mild seasonal ragweed-induced asthma was examined in an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in nine centers in 146 patients (75/<span class="Bold">Tilade</span> ; 71/placebo). These patients had a mean baseline FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> that was 85% of predicted normal and a mean baseline beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonist requirement of less than 2 inhalations of albuterol from a metered dose inhaler per day. Study medication was given four times a day. Efficacy was assessed on the basis of diary card symptom scores (daytime asthma, sleep disturbance, daytime cough, and morning asthma, all rated on a six point scale: 0=no symptoms; 5=severe symptoms) and as-needed bronchodilator use. The primary efficacy variable was based on both the summary symptom score (total of daytime asthma, daytime cough, and sleep disturbance) and as-needed bronchodilator usage. At the end of the treatment phase, parents and clinicians assessed treatment effectiveness on a five-point scale: 1=very effective; 5=made condition worse. After a two-week baseline, patients were randomized to eight weeks of double-blind treatment. The results of these evaluations are shown in Table 3.</p><p>The percentage change from baseline in summary symptom score by week is shown in Figure 2.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2</span></p><p></p><p>This study shows that <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> , when used prophylactically in asthmatics with known seasonal exacerbations, can attenuate an increase in symptoms of asthma and reduce the need for rescue bronchodilator treatment.</p><h2>Indications and Usage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler is indicated for maintenance therapy in the management of adult and pediatric patients 6 years and older with mild to moderate asthma.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> is not indicated for the reversal of acute bronchospasm.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to nedocromil sodium or other ingredients in this preparation.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tilade<span class="Sup">®</span></span> Inhaler (nedocromil sodium inhalation aerosol) is not a bronchodilator and, therefore, should not be used for the reversal of acute bronchospasm, particularly status asthmaticus. <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> should ordinarily be continued during acute exacerbations, unless the patient becomes intolerant to the use of inhaled dosage forms.</p><p>As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm, which can be life-threatening, may occur immediately after administration. If this occurs, <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> should be discontinued and alternative therapy instituted.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> The role of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in patients receiving oral or inhaled corticosteroids remains to be defined.

No formal drug-drug interaction studies, however, have been conducted.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> A two-year inhalation carcinogenicity study of nedocromil sodium at a dose of 24 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) in Wistar rats showed no carcinogenic potential.

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> is administered to a nursing woman.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Safety data in normal volunteers and asthmatic patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years are available on a total of 311 children from U.S. clinical trials and 192 children from foreign clinical trials (total = 503) of 4–12 weeks duration. An additional 225 children received <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> for 40 weeks and 24 received <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> for 52 weeks.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> in children ages 6 through 11 have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. (See <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES: Pediatric Studies</span>.) Use of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> in children ages 6 through 11 years is also supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> in adults. The safety and effectiveness of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> in patients below the age of 6 years have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> Clinical studies of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> is generally well tolerated. Adverse event information was derived from 6,469 patients receiving <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> in controlled and open-label clinical trials of 1–52 weeks in duration. A total of 4,400 patients received two inhalations four times a day. An additional 2,069 patients received two inhalations twice daily or another dose regimen. Seventy-seven percent of patients were treated with <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> for eight weeks or longer.</p><p>Of the 4,400 patients who received two inhalations of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> four times a day, 2,632 were in placebo-controlled, parallel trials and of these 6.0% withdrew from the trials due to adverse events, compared to 5.7% of the 2,446 patients who received placebo.</p><p>The reasons for withdrawal were generally similar in the <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> and placebo-treated groups, except that patients withdrew due to bad taste statistically more frequently on <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> than on placebo. Headache reported as severe or very severe, some with nausea and ill feeling, was experienced by 1.0% of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> patients and 0.7% of placebo patients.</p><p>The events reported with a frequency of 1% or greater across all placebo-controlled studies are displayed for all patients ages 6 years and older who received <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> or placebo at two inhalations four times daily.</p><p>The adverse event profile observed in children ages 6 through 11 was similar to that observed in adults.</p><p>Other adverse events present at less than the 1% level of occurrence, but that might be related to <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> administration, include arthritis, tremor, and a sensation of warmth.</p><p>In clinical trials with 2,632 patients receiving <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> , 2 patients (0.08%) developed neutropenia and 3 patients (0.11%) developed leukopenia. Although it is unclear if these reactions were caused by <span class="Bold">Tilade</span>, in several cases these abnormal laboratory tests returned to normal when <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> was discontinued.</p><p>There have been reports of clinically significant elevation of hepatic transaminases (ALT and AST greater than 10 times the upper limit of the normal reference range in one patient) associated with the administration of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> . It is unclear if these abnormal laboratory tests in asymptomatic patients were caused by <span class="Bold">Tilade</span>.</p><p>Cases of bronchospasm immediately following dosing with <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> have been reported from postmarketing experience. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.) Isolated cases of pneumonitis with eosinophilia (PIE syndrome) and anaphylaxis have also been reported in which a relationship to drug is undetermined.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no experience to date with overdose of Tilade in humans. There were no deaths in rodents at an oral dose of 4,000 mg/kg (approximately 690 times [for mice] and 1,370 times [for rats] the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The subcutaneous or intravenous lethal dose in rats was between 2,000 and 4,000 mg/kg (approximately 690 and 1,370 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). No deaths occurred in mice at a subcutaneous dose of 4,000 mg/kg (approximately 690 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), and the intravenous lethal dose in mice was between 2,000 and 4,000 mg/kg (approximately 345 and 690 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). An intravenous dose of 240 mg/kg (approximately 110 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) did not produce any deaths in cats. Head shaking/tremor and salivation were observed in beagle dogs following daily inhalation doses of 5 mg/kg (approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and transient hypotension was detected following daily subcutaneous doses of 8 mg/kg (approximately 9 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In addition, clonic convulsions were observed in dogs following daily inhalation doses of 20 mg/kg plus subcutaneous doses of 20 mg/kg giving peak plasma nedocromil levels of 7.6 µg/mL, some three orders of magnitude greater than peak plasma levels (2.5 ng/mL) of the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose. Specific tests designed to evaluate CNS activity demonstrated no effects due to nedocromil sodium, and nedocromil sodium does not pass the blood brain barrier. Therefore, overdosage is unlikely to result in clinical manifestations requiring more than observation and discontinuation of the drug where appropriate.</p><h2>Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended dosage for adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older is two inhalations four times a day at regular intervals, which provides a dose of 14 mg per day. In patients whose asthma is well controlled on this dosage (<span class="Italics">e.g.</span>, patients who only need occasional inhaled or oral beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists and who are not experiencing serious exacerbations), less frequent administration may be effective.</p><p>Each <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler canister must be primed with 3 actuations prior to the first use. If a canister remains unused for more than 7 days, then it should be reprimed with 3 actuations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler may be added to the patient’s existing treatment regimen (<span class="Italics">e.g.</span>, bronchodilators). When a clinical response to <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler is evident and if the patient’s asthma is under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication usage gradually.</p><p>Proper inhalational technique is essential (see Patient Instructions for Use).</p><p>Patientsshould be advised that the optimal effect of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> therapy depends upon its administration at regular intervals, even during symptom-free periods.</p><h2>How Supplied</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler is available in 16.2 g canisters providing at least 104 metered inhalations.

Make sure that your doctor knows what other medicines you are taking.</p><p>DO NOT use after the date shown as “EXP” on the label or box.</p><h2>Instructions for Use</h2><p class="First">The following is one of several acceptable inhalation techniques. If your physician has suggested another method, you should use that method.</p><p class="First">To use the <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler, remove the Mouthpiece Cover and make sure the metal Canister is fully and firmly inserted into the plastic Mouthpiece. <span class="Bold">Do not remove the Valve Cover from the metal Canister</span> (Figures 1a &amp; 1b). </p><p class="MultiMediaCaptionNotCentered">Inhaler Components</p><p class="MultiMediaCaptionNotCentered">Assembly of Inhaler</p><p class="First">To prepare your <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler for use, the Inhaler must be primed prior to the first use. To prime, hold the Inhaler upright, with the Mouthpiece facing away from you. Shake the Inhaler, then press firmly downward on the Canister. Repeat this procedure again until a total of three (3) sprays are released. Your <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler is now ready for use. Repriming is only necessary when your Inhaler remains unused for more than 7 days. To reprime, shake the Inhaler and release one spray. Repeat this procedure until a total of three (3) sprays are released.</p><p class="First">Hold the Inhaler (as illustrated in Figure 2) and <span class="Bold">shake well</span> before each use. The Mouthpiece should be inspected for the presence of foreign objects before use. For optimal results, the Canister should be at room temperature before use.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Avoid spraying in eyes.</span></p><p class="First">Hold the Inhaler away from your mouth, as shown, and exhale slowly. <span class="Bold">Do not breathe into the Inhaler as moisture could cause it to clog</span> (Figure 3).</p><p class="First">Place the Mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it. Tilt your head back, keeping your tongue below the opening of the Inhaler (Figure 4).</p><p class="First">Press the top of the Canister down firmly at exactly the same time as you begin to inhale. Keep the Canister depressed as you continue to inhale slowly through your mouth until you have taken a full breath (Figure 5). After you have finished your full breath, release the pressure of your finger from the top of the Canister. </p><p class="First">Remove the Inhaler from your mouth, and <span class="Bold">hold your breath</span> as long as comfortably possible before breathing out slowly. This step is very important because it allows the medication to spread throughout your lungs.</p><p class="First">Repeat Steps 3-8; then replace the Mouthpiece Cover.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Keeping the plastic Mouthpiece clean is extremely important to prevent medication buildup and blockage.</span> To clean, simply remove the Canister and Mouthpiece Cover, and wash the Mouthpiece through the top and bottom in HOT water (Figures 6 &amp; 7). <span class="Bold">Never immerse the metal Canister in water.</span> The Mouthpiece can be washed every day, and should be washed at least twice a week. To dry, shake off excess water and let the Mouthpiece air dry in a warm place overnight. When the Mouthpiece is completely dry, replace the Canister and Mouthpiece Cover.</p><h2>For Best Results</h2><p class="First">Use the Inhaler every day, as directed by your physician. Do not stop the treatment, or even reduce the dosage during symptom-free periods, without your physician’s permission.</p><p class="First">Remember, your <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler must be primed prior to the first use. Repriming is only necessary when the Inhaler remains unused for more than 7 days. Do not reprime between more frequent usage. (See Step 2 under INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE.) Note: The Valve Cover should not be removed from the Canister (see Step 1 under INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE).</p><p class="First">It is essential that the Canister be pressed at exactly the same time as you inhale. It is well worth your time to review this technique with your physician.</p><p class="First">The dose delivered from the Inhaler can be seen as a fine mist. If you notice this mist escaping from your mouth or nose, you may not be breathing in at the exact moment the Canister is being pressed (see Steps 6 &amp; 7 under INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE).</p><p class="First">Keep the Mouthpiece Cover on the Inhaler when not in use so that dirt can’t get into it.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Keep a record of the number of sprays used and discard the Canister after 104 sprays.</span>The amount of medication in each spray cannot be assured after 104 sprays. Please note that the Canister has been filled with extra suspension to accommodate the initial priming activity.</p><p class="First">The <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Canister is to be used only with the <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler Mouthpiece and should not be used with other mouthpieces. In addition, the <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Mouthpiece should not be used with canisters of other inhaled medications.</p><p class="First">While taking <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> Inhaler, other inhaled drugs should be taken only as directed by your physician.</p><h2>Product Utilization</h2><p class="First">For the treatment of mild to moderate asthma in patients 6 years of age and older, the recommended dosage is two (2) inhalations four times a day at regular intervals. For maintenance therapy, daily dosing frequency will depend upon your physician’s assessment of your asthma and may be four times a day or less at regular intervals.</p><p>With regular use, <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> will decrease asthma symptoms. However, <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> will not relieve the symptoms of an asthma attack once the attack has started.</p><p>It is important that you follow your physician’s daily dosing instructions– even during symptom-free periods – to achieve optimal benefit from this medication. Please note that <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> is not a steroid medication.</p><p>Benefits which may be achieved from regular use of <span class="Bold">Tilade</span> include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p class="First">Prevention or reduction of asthma symptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness, cough, and shortness of breath.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="First">Treatment of the bronchial inflammation that causes asthma.</p>
