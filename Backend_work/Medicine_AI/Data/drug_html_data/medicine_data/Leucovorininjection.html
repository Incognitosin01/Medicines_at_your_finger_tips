Folic acid helps your body produce and maintain new cells, and also helps prevent changes in DNA that may lead to cancer. A lack of folic acid in the body can cause anemia, a decrease in red blood cells that carry oxygen through your blood to your tissues and organs.</p><p>Leucovorin is used to treat anemia (low red blood cells) caused by a lack of natural folic acid in the body.</p><p>Leucovorin is also used to prevent serious side effects caused by large doses or accidental overdose of medications that can reduce the effects of folic acid in the body. This includes methotrexate, pyrimethamine, and others.</p><p>Leucovorin is sometimes used in a chemotherapy combination to lengthen survival time in people with advanced colorectal cancer. Leucovorin does not treat the cancer itself.</p><p>Leucovorin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not be treated with leucovorin if you have pernicious anemia or other types of anemia caused by a lack of vitamin B12.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with leucovorin if you have pernicious anemia or other types of anemia caused by a lack of vitamin B12.</p><p>If possible before you receive leucovorin, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>

A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>When treating an accidental overdose, leucovorin should be started as soon as possible for the best effect.</p><p>Leucovorin is usually given every 6 hours when used to treat accidental overdose or to prevent side effects from high-dose methotrexate or similar medicines.</p><p>When used in chemotherapy, leucovorin is usually given for 5 days in a row, every 4 to 5 weeks.</p><p>Follow your doctor's dosing instructions very carefully.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests to help your doctor determine how long to treat you with leucovorin.</p><p>Leucovorin is usually given with other medications to help your kidneys remove methotrexate from your body if needed.
