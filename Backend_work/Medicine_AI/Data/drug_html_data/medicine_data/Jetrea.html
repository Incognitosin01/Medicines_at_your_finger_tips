Jetrea is the first pharmacological agent to be approved for this indication.</p><p>The approval was based on the data from ThromboGenics’ Phase III program where Jetrea was shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of symptomatic VMA (26.5% versus 10.1%; p&lt;0.01).</p><p>Treatment with Jetrea was associated with some, mainly transient, ocular adverse events. The most common side effects reported in patients treated with Jetrea include eye floaters; bleeding of the conjunctiva, the tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye; eye pain; flashes of light (photopsia); blurred vision; unclear vision; vision loss; retinal edema (swelling); and macular edema.</p><p>The recommended dose of Jetrea is 0.125mg (0.1mL) of the diluted solution administered by intravitreal injection to the affected eye once as a single injection. Jetrea is provided as a single use glass vial containing 0.5 mg in 0.2mL solution for intravitreal injection (2.5 mg/mL).</p><h2>Highlights of Prescribing Information</h2><p>These highlights do not include all the information needed to use Jetrea safely and effectively.
