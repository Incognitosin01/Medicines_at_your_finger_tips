<li>Side effects</li></ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">What is Breztri Aerosphere?</h2><p>Breztri Aerosphere combines 3 medicines, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medicine (budesonide), an anticholinergic medicine (glycopyrrolate), and a long-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist (LABA) medicine (formoterol fumarate) in 1 inhaler, delivered as a propelled spray.</p><ul>
<li>ICS medicines such as budesonide help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to breathing problems.</li>
<li>Anticholinergic medicines, such as glycopyrrolate and LABA medicines, such as formoterol fumarate help the muscles around the airways in your lungs stay relaxed to prevent symptoms, such as wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms can happen when the muscles around the airways tighten. This makes it hard to breathe.</li>
<li>Breztri Aerosphere is a prescription medicine used long term to treat people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a chronic lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both.</li>
<li>Breztri Aerosphere is used as 2 inhalations, 2 times each day (2 puffs in the morning and 2 puffs in the evening) to improve symptoms of COPD for better breathing and to reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days).</li>
<li><strong>Breztri Aerosphere is not for the treatment of asthma.</strong> It is not known if this medicine is safe and effective in people with asthma. Breztri Aerosphere contains formoterol fumarate. LABA medicines such as formoterol fumarate when used alone increase the risk of hospitalizations and death from asthma problems. Breztri Aerosphere contains an ICS, an anticholinergic, and a LABA. When an ICS and LABA are used together, there is not a significant risk in hospitalizations and deaths from asthma problems.</li>
<li>Breztri Aerosphere is not to be used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace a rescue inhaler. Always have a rescue inhaler (an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator) with you to treat sudden breathing problems. If you do not have a rescue inhaler, contact your healthcare provider to have one prescribed for you.</li>
<li>Breztri Aerosphere should not be used in children. It is not known if this medicine is safe and effective in children.</li>
</ul><h2>Who should not use Breztri Aerosphere?</h2><p>Do not use Breztri Aerosphere if you are allergic to budesonide, glycopyrrolate, formoterol, or any of the other ingredients. See <em>What are the ingredients in Breztri Aerosphere?</em> at the end of this page for a complete list of ingredients.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Breztri Aerosphere</h2><p>Before using Breztri Aerosphere, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</p><ul>

<li><strong>fungal infection in your mouth or throat (thrush).</strong> Rinse your mouth with water without swallowing after using Breztri Aerosphere to help reduce your chance of getting thrush.</li>
<li><strong>pneumonia.</strong> People with COPD have a higher chance of getting pneumonia. Breztri Aerosphere may increase your chance of getting pneumonia. Call your healthcare provider if you notice any of the following symptoms:

This can happen when you stop taking oral corticosteroid medicines (such as prednisone) and start taking a medicine containing an ICS (such as Breztri Aerosphere). During this transition period, when your body is under stress from fever, trauma (such as a car accident), infection, surgery, or worse COPD symptoms, adrenal insufficiency can get worse and may cause death.<br/>
