Malabsorption of cobalamin resulting from structural or functional damage to the stomach - where intrinsic factor is secreted, or to the ileum, where intrinsic factor facilitates cobalamin absorption. Folate deficiency in these patients is usually more severe than cobalamin deficiency;</p><p>      2. Genetic polymorphisms such as MTHFR that impede folate metabolism and the effective use of synthetic folic acid (oxidized form); and</p><p>      3. Inadequate secretion of intrinsic factor, resulting from lesions that destroy the gastric mucosa (ingestion of corrosives, extensive neoplasia), and a number of conditions associated with a variable degree of gastric atrophy (certain endocrine disorders, iron deficiency, and subtotal gastrectomy). <span class="Italics">Total gastrectomy always produces cobalamin deficiency. Structural lesions leading to cobalamin deficiency include regional ileitis, ileal resections, malignancies, etc</span></p><h2>MECHANISM OF ACTION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">COBALAMIN </span>[<span class="Italics">treatment</span>]; <span class="Bold">FOLATE </span>[<span class="Italics">prevention</span>]; <span class="Bold">INTRINSIC FACTOR </span>[<span class="Italics">facilitator</span>] -</p><p><span class="Italics">Cobalamin is essential for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine - a reaction which also requires folate. In the absence of cobalamin - ie, cobalamin deficiency, tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from l-methylfolic acid, and a functional folate deficiency occurs - ie, “methyl trap hypothesis”. Gastrointestinal absorption of cobalamin depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor, and lack of intrinisic factor results in cobalamin deficiency.</span></p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">   The adult dose is one capsule daily preferably on an empty stomach</span>.</p><p>   A deficiency of cobalamin may present first as folate deficiency - which is why folate supplementation may mask the symptoms that would normally result and also why advanced folate supplementation requires licensed medical supervision; because of this, <span class="Bold">reticulocyte plasma count, cobalamin and folate must be obtained prior to treatment</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">. </span></span><span class="Italics">Requirements of cobalamin and/or folate in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation. </span></p><p><span class="Italics">   As a general rule - in Pernicious Anemia patients,</span> <span class="Italics">treatment will be required for the remainder of the patient’s life</span><span class="Italics">, and usually requires weekly or monthly injections at the doctor's office. Patients that are non-compliant with parenteral therapy (injections) may use this product as a substitute ONLY UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER. </span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">   Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of entire body may occur with administration of cobalamin. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate.</p><p>   Sensitivity to porcine intrinsic factor derived from liver substance has been reported in patients, and may occur at any time; <span class="Bold">Biopar<span class="Sup">TM</span><span class="Italics">delta</span>-FORTE</span> contains a non-inhibitory form of intrinsic factor that is not derived from liver substance but rather just the mucosa (stomach substance) - in which such senstitivity is less likely to occur, however caution is advised and continuous monitoring under licensed medical supervision is required.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">GENERAL</span>:</p><p>      0.1 mg or more of folic acid daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that the hematological remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The safe tolerable limit for folic acid (<span class="Italics">in preparations</span>) is 1 mg [emphasis added];</p><p>      Folic acid is not a substitute for vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> - although it may improve vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-deficient anemias. <span class="Bold">Exclusive use of folic acid in treating vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-deficient anemias could result in progressive and irreversible neurologic damage</span>. Specifically, vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency allowed to progress over 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord - as observed when folate therapy is used as the only hematopoietic agent;</p><p>      Doses of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis; and -</p><p><span class="Italics">      A dietary deficiency of only vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is rare; multiple vitamin deficiency is expected in any dietary deficiency. No single regimen fits all cases, and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span>:</p><p>      Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid, and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of cobalamin.</p><p>      Epileptic, antineoplastic and Parkinson's medications are cautioned in the concimant use with folate supplementation.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">   Biopar</span><span class="Sup">TM </span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">delta</span></span><span class="Bold">-FORTE</span> is supplied as oval, annatto (”orangish-brown”) multiphasic softgels<span class="Sup">*</span> with imprint "<span class="Bold">7N3</span>".
