In your body, iron becomes a part of your hemoglobin (HEEM o glo bin) and myoglobin (MY o glo bin). Hemoglobin carries oxygen through your blood to tissues and organs. Myoglobin helps your muscle cells store oxygen.</p><p>Ferumoxytol is used to treat iron deficiency anemia (a lack of red blood cells caused by having too little iron in the body).</p><p>Ferumoxytol injection is used in people with chronic kidney disease, or in people unable to take oral iron (by mouth) or who have not responded well to oral iron.</p><p>Ferumoxytol may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use ferumoxytol if you have ever had an allergic reaction to an injectable form of iron (including ferumoxytol), or if you have iron overload syndrome or any type of anemia that is not caused by iron deficiency.</p><p><b>Ferumoxytol can cause severe and sometimes fatal allergic reactions</b>, even if you have used  ferumoxytol before without any reaction.
