Reduced degradation of acetylcholine leads to continuous stimulation of  the ciliary muscle producing miosis; other effects include potentiation of accommodation and facilitation of aqueous humor outflow, with attendant reduction in intraocular pressure.</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Miosis: ≤60 minutes; Peak effect: Intraocular pressure decrease: 24 hours </p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Miosis: 1 to 4 weeks; Intraocular pressure: Days to weeks. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Accommodative esotropia:</b> Concomitant esotropias with a significant accommodative component</p><p><b>Elevated intraocular pressure: </b>Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to echothiophate or any component of the formulation; most cases of angle-closure glaucoma without iridectomy (due to possibility of increasing angle block); active uveal inflammation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Elevated intraocular pressure: </b>Ophthalmic:</p><p>Initial: Instill 1 drop in affected eye(s) twice daily (prior to bedtime and in the morning)</p><p>Maintenance: Twice-daily dosing is preferred, but some patients have been treated with once-daily or every-other-day dosing (with 1 dose just prior to bedtime).</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Esotropia, accommodative:</b> Children and Adolescents: Ophthalmic:</p><p>Diagnosis: Instill 1 drop once daily into both eyes at bedtime for 2 to 3 weeks</p><p>Treatment: Instill 1 drop every other day in both eyes; gradually lower dose as treatment progresses. Maximum daily dose: 1 drop once daily in both eyes. <b>Note:</b> Use lowest frequency which gives satisfactory response; if necessary, more aggressive therapy may be used for short periods of time.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Pour diluent into drug container; without compressing rubber bulb, insert dropper assembly into drug container and screw down tightly. Shake well to ensure mixing. </p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Ophthalmic: Proper administration technique is required for maximal benefit. The nasolacrimal duct(s) should be compressed for 1 to 2 minutes after instillation of the drops. Excess fluid around the eye should be blotted with tissue; wash hands after instillation.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store undiluted vials at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Store reconstituted solutions at ~25°C (~77°F); do not refrigerate; discard unused solution after 4 weeks. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Cyclopentolate: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Echothiophate Iodide.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Mivacurium: Echothiophate Iodide may increase the serum concentration of Mivacurium. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Succinylcholine: Echothiophate Iodide may increase the serum concentration of Succinylcholine.  Management: For patients receiving echothiophate iodide eye drops, consider using a neuromuscular-blocking agents other than succinylcholine. If succinylcholine is used, consider a reduced dose, and monitor for enhanced/prolonged effects.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined.</p><p>Cardiovascular: Bradycardia, cardiac abnormality, flushing, hypotension</p><p>Central nervous system: Brow ache, myasthenia</p><p>Dermatologic: Diaphoresis</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting</p><p>Ophthalmic: Blepharospasm, blurred vision, burning sensation of eyes, cataract, conjunctival abnormalities (thickening), conjunctival erythema, eye redness, increased intraocular pressure (paradoxical), iris cyst, iritis (latent), lacrimal duct obstruction (nasolacrimal canal), lacrimation, miosis, myopia, retinal detachment, stinging of eyes, uveitis (activation)</p><p>Respiratory: Dyspnea</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiac irregularities: Temporarily or permanently discontinue if cardiac irregularities occur.</p><p>• Cholinergic effects: Discontinue if symptoms of excess cholinergic activity (eg, salivation, sweating, urinary incontinence); overdosage may result in cholinergic crisis, which must be distinguished from myasthenic crisis.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Asthma: Not generally recommended for use in patients with asthma.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Not generally recommended for use in patients with bradycardia, hypotension or recent MI. In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, ophthalmic cholinergic agents have been determined to be agents that may exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction (magnitude: minor) (AHA [Page 2016]).</p><p>• Gastrointestinal disease: Not generally recommended for use in patients with spastic gastrointestinal disturbances or peptic ulcer disease.</p><p>• Parkinsonism: Not generally recommended for use in patients with Parkinsonism.</p><p>• Seizure disorder: Not generally recommended for use in patients with a history of seizure disorder.</p><p>• Vagotonia: Not generally recommended for use in patients with vagotonia.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Do not use for tonometric glaucoma, or in patients with active or history of uveitis, or history of retinal detachment. Use cautiously prior to ophthalmic surgery due to risk of blood in the anterior chamber. Digital compression of the nasolacrimal ducts for 1 to 2 minutes following instillation to minimize drainage into the nasal chamber is recommended. Wash hands following instillation.</p><p>• Exposure to pesticides and insecticides: Use with caution in patients exposed to carbamate- or organophosphate-type insecticides and pesticides; absorption of the pesticide through skin or respiratory tract may result in additive systemic effects; respiratory masks and frequent clothing changes may be necessary during exposure to pesticides in patients receiving echothiophate iodide.</p><p>• Tolerance: Patients may develop tolerance after prolonged use; a rest period restores response to the drug.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Baseline measurement of anterior chamber angle; routine lens examinations (for opacities and during treatment of accommodative esotropia); IOP (at different times of the day)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to lower high eye pressure.</p><p>• It is used to treat cross-eyed children.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
