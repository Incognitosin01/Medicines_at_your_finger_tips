The recommendations for dosing will be updated if indicated by findings from those studies. The findings are expected in the near future.</p><p>As with the seasonal influenza vaccines, the 2009 H1N1 vaccines are being produced in formulations that contain thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative, and in formulations that do not contain thimerosal.</p><p>People with severe or life-threatening allergies to chicken eggs, or to any other substance in the vaccine, should not be vaccinated.</p><p>In the ongoing clinical studies, the vaccines have been well tolerated. Potential side effects of the H1N1 vaccines are expected to be similar to those of seasonal flu vaccines.</p><p>For the injected vaccine, the most common side effect is soreness at the injection site. Other side effects may include mild fever, body aches, and fatigue for a few days after the inoculation. For the nasal spray vaccine, the most common side effects include runny nose or nasal congestion for all ages, sore throats in adults, and -- in children 2 to 6 years old -- fever.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">What is Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine?</h2><p>Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine is an inactivated influenza virus vaccine indicated for active immunization of persons ages 18 years of age and older against influenza disease caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.</p><h2>How will I receive Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine?</h2><p>Based on currently available information, the vaccination regimen is as follows:</p><p>Adults 18 years of age and older:</p><ul>
