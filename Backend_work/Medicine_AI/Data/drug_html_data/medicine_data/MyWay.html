Certain medications can make levonorgestrel less effective as an emergency form of contraception.</p><p>My Way is not intended for use as a routine form of birth control and should not be used in this manner. Talk with your doctor about the many forms of birth control available.</p><p>Levonorgestrel may slow breast milk production. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take  My Way?</h2><p>Use exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor.</p><p>My Way must be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex (no later than 72 hours afterward).</p><p>Call your doctor right away if you vomit within 2 hours after taking  My Way. <b>Do not take a second dose without first asking your doctor.</b></p><p>Visit your doctor within 3 weeks after taking My Way. A doctor should confirm that you are not pregnant, and that this medicine has not caused any harmful effects.</p><p>If your period is late by 1 week or longer after the expected date, you may be pregnant. Get a pregnancy test and contact your doctor if you are pregnant. My Way will not terminate pregnancy if the fertilized egg has attached to the uterus.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since  My Way is used as a single dose, it does not have a daily dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Because  My Way is supplied as a single tablet in an exact strength, an overdose is unlikely to occur when the levonorgestrel is used as directed. Do not take more than one tablet at the same time.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking  My Way?</h2><p>My Way will not protect you from sexually transmitted diseases--including HIV and AIDS.
