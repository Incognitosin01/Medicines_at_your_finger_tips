</ul><h2>Clindamycin Topical Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate topical solution USP, 1% contains clindamycin phosphate, USP, at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per milliliter.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi-synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin.</p><p>The structural formula is represented below:</p><p>The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is Methyl 7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-(1  methyl-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-4-propyl-L-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamido)-1-thio-L-<span class="Italics">threo</span>-Î±-D-<span class="Italics">galacto</span> octopyranoside 2-(dihydrogen phosphate).</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate topical solution USP, 1% contains isopropyl alcohol, 50% v/v; propylene glycol and purified water. Sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid may be added to adjust pH between 4.0 to 7.0.</p><h2>Clindamycin Topical Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>The mechanism of action of clindamycin in treating acne vulgaris is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>Following multiple topical applications of clindamycin phosphate at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per mL in an isopropyl alcohol and water solution, very low levels of clindamycin are present in the serum (0 to 3 ng/mL) and less than 0.2% of the dose is recovered in urine as clindamycin.</p><p>Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, rapid <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Microbiology</span></p><p>Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Antimicrobial Activity</span></span></p><p>Clindamycin is active in vitro against most isolates of <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span>; however, the clinical significance is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Resistance</span></span></p><p>Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolideinducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Clindamycin Topical Solution</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate topical solution USP, 1% is indicated in the treatment of acne vulgaris. In view of the potential for diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, the physician should consider whether other agents are more appropriate (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate topical solution is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin, a history of regional enteritis or ulcerative colitis, or a history of antibiotic-associated colitis.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis which may result in patient death. Use of the topical formulation of clindamycin results in absorption of the antibiotic from the skin surface. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Endoscopic examination may reveal pseudomembranous colitis. <span class="Bold">Stool culture for <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> and stool assay for <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> toxin may be helpful diagnostically.</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">When significant diarrhea occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Large bowel endoscopy should be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis in cases of severe diarrhea.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen the condition. Vancomycin has been found to be effective in the treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>. The usual adult dosage is 500 milligrams to 2 grams of vancomycin orally per day in three to four divided doses administered for 7 to 10 days. <span class="Bold">Cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind vancomycin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.</span> If both a resin and vancomycin are to be administered concurrently, it may be advisable to separate the time of administration of each drug.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis have been observed to begin up to several weeks following cessation of oral and parenteral therapy with clindamycin.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>Clindamycin phosphate topical solution contains an alcohol base which will cause burning and irritation of the eye. In the event of accidental contact with sensitive surfaces (eye, abraded skin, mucous membranes), bathe with copious amounts of cool tap water. The solution has an unpleasant taste and caution should be exercised when applying medication around the mouth.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate topical solution should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Teratogenic effects</span></p><p>In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities. There are no adequate studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in breast milk following use of clindamycin phosphate topical solution. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>If used during lactation and clindamycin phosphate topical solution is applied to the chest, care should be taken to avoid accidental ingestion by the infant.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></p><p>Clinical studies for Clindamycin Phosphate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In 18 clinical studies of various formulations of Clindamycin phosphate using placebo vehicle and/or active comparator drugs as controls, patients experienced a number of treatment emergent adverse dermatologic events [see table below].</p><p class="First Footnote"># not recorded</p><p class="First Footnote">* of 126 subjects</p><p>Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis which may end fatally.</p><p>Cases of diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported as adverse reactions in patients treated with oral and parenteral formulations of clindamycin and rarely with topical clindamycin (see WARNINGS).</p><p>Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disturbances, gram-negative folliculitis, eye pain and contact dermatitis have also been reported in association with the use of topical formulations of clindamycin.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Topically applied clindamycin phosphate can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects (see WARNINGS).</p><h2>Clindamycin Topical Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply a thin film of Clindamycin phosphate topical solution, twice daily to affected area.</p><p>Keep all liquid dosage forms in containers tightly closed.</p><h2>How is Clindamycin Topical Solution Supplied</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin phosphate topical solution USP, 1% containing clindamycin phosphate equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per milliliter are clear solution with characteristics odor free from particulate matter.
