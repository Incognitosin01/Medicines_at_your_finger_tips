</ul><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is a synthetic antibacterial combination product available in DS (double strength) tablets, each containing 800 mg sulfamethoxazole, USP and 160 mg trimethoprim, USP; in tablets, each containing 400 mg sulfamethoxazole, USP and 80 mg trimethoprim, USP for oral administration.</p><p>Sulfamethoxazole, USP is <span class="Italics">N</span><span class="Sup">1</span>-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl) sulfanilamide; the molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S. It is an almost white, odorless, tasteless compound with a molecular weight of 253.28 and the following structural formula:</p><p>Trimethoprim, USP is 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl) pyrimidine; the molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>N<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>. It is a white to light yellow, odorless, bitter compound with a molecular weight of 290.3. It has the following structural formula:</p><p><span class="Bold">Inactive Ingredients</span>: Magnesium stearate, povidone, pregelatinized starch and sodium starch glycolate.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound and metabolized forms; sulfamethoxazole also exists as the conjugated form. Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in humans to at least 5 metabolites: the N<span class="Sub">4</span>-acetyl-, N<span class="Sub">4</span>-hydroxy-, 5-methylhydroxy-, N<span class="Sub">4</span>-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy- sulfamethoxazole metabolites and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The formulation of N<span class="Sub">4</span>-hydroxy metabolite is mediated <span class="Italics">via</span> CYP2C9.</p><p>Trimethoprim is metabolized <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> to 11 different metabolites, of which, five are glutathione adducts and six are oxidative metabolites, including the major metabolites, 1- and 3-oxides and the 3- and 4-hydroxy derivatives.</p><p>The free forms of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considered to be the therapeutically active forms.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies suggest that trimethoprim is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, OCT1 and OCT2, and that sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein.</p><p>Approximately 70% of sulfamethoxazole and 44% of trimethoprim are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim by an insignificant degree; trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole.</p><p>Peak blood levels for the individual components occur 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. The mean serum half-lives of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are 10 and 8 to 10 hours, respectively. However, patients with severely impaired renal function exhibit an increase in the half-lives of both components, requiring dosage regimen adjustment (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> section). Detectable amounts of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are present in the blood 24 hours after drug administration. During administration of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim b.i.d., the mean steady-state plasma concentration of trimethoprim was 1.72 mcg/mL. The steady-state mean plasma levels of free and total sulfamethoxazole were 57.4 mcg/mL and 68 mcg/mL, respectively. These steady-state levels were achieved after three days of drug administration<span class="Sup">1</span>. Excretion of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is primarily by the kidneys through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Urine concentrations of both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are considerably higher than are the concentrations in the blood. The average percentage of the dose recovered in urine from 0 to 72 hours after a single oral dose of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is 84.5% for total sulfonamide and 66.8% for free trimethoprim. Thirty percent of the total sulfonamide is excreted as free sulfamethoxazole, with the remaining as N<span class="Sub">4</span>-acetylated metabolite<span class="Sup">2</span>. When administered together as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, neither sulfamethoxazole nor trimethoprim affects the urinary excretion pattern of the other.</p><p>Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim distribute to sputum, vaginal fluid and middle ear fluid; trimethoprim also distributes to bronchial secretion, and both pass the placental barrier and are excreted in human milk.</p><p>Geriatric Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg were studied in 6 geriatric subjects (mean age: 78.6 years) and 6 young healthy subjects (mean age: 29.3 years) using a non-US approved formulation. Pharmacokinetic values for sulfamethoxazole in geriatric subjects were similar to those observed in young adult subjects. The mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was significantly lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects (19 mL/h/kg vs. 55 mL/h/kg). However, after normalizing by body weight, the apparent total body clearance of trimethoprim was on average 19% lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects<span class="Sup">3</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Microbiology</span></p><p>Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with paraaminobenzoic acid (PABA). Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase. Thus, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim blocks two consecutive steps in the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins essential to many bacteria.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that bacterial resistance develops more slowly with both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination than with either sulfamethoxazole or trimethoprim alone.</p><p>Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section.</p><p><span class="Bold">Aerobic Gram-Positive Microorganisms:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> (including susceptible enterotoxigenic strains implicated in traveler’s diarrhea)</p><p><span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species</p><p><span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Morganella morganii</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Proteus vulgaris</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Shigella flexneri</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Shigella sonnei</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Other Organisms:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci</span><br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Testing</span></span></p><p>For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.</p><p><span class="Italics">Urinary Tract Infections:</span> For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> species, <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species, <span class="Italics">Morganella morganii</span>, <span class="Italics">Proteus mirabilis</span> and <span class="Italics">Proteus vulgaris</span>. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.</p><p><span class="Italics">Acute Otitis Media:</span> For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> or <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in pediatric patients under two years of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are not indicated for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age.</p><p><span class="Italics">Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults:</span> For the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> or <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> when a physician deems that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim could offer some advantage over the use of a single antimicrobial agent.</p><p><span class="Italics">Shigellosis:</span> For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Shigella flexneri</span> and <span class="Italics">Shigella sonnei</span> when antibacterial therapy is indicated.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia:</span> For the treatment of documented <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci</span> pneumonia and for prophylaxis against <span class="Italics">P. jiroveci</span> pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an increased risk of developing <span class="Italics">P. jiroveci</span> pneumonia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Traveler’s Diarrhea in Adults:</span> For the treatment of traveler’s diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides, in patients with a history of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia with use of trimethoprim and/or sulfonamides, and in patients with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency.</p><p>Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is also contraindicated in patients with marked hepatic damage or with severe renal insufficiency when renal function status cannot be monitored.</p><h2>WARNINGS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Embryofetal Toxicity</span></span></p><p>Some epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. If sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be advised of the potential hazards to the fetus.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity and Other Fatal Reactions</span></span></p><p>Fatalities associated with the administration of sulfonamides, although rare, have occurred due to severe reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias.</p><p>Sulfonamides, including sulfonamide-containing products such as sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction. In rare instances, a skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis and serious blood disorders (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Clinical signs, such as rash, sore throat, fever, arthralgia, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.</p><p>Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates are hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract that have been reported in association with sulfonamide treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Thrombocytopenia</span></span></p><p>Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever</span></span></p><p>The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adjunctive treatment with Leucovorin for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia</span></span></p><p>Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci</span> pneumonia in a randomized placebo controlled trial<span class="Sup">4</span>. Co-administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and leucovorin during treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci</span> pneumonia should be avoided.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Development of drug resistant bacteria</span></span></p><p>Prescribing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Folate deficiency</span></span></p><p>Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be given with caution to patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, to those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome and patients in malnutrition states) and to those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma.</p><p>Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hemolysis</span></span></p><p>In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hypoglycemia</span></span></p><p>Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are particularly at risk.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Phenylalanine metabolism</span></span></p><p>Trimethoprim has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Porphyria and Hypothyroidism</span></span></p><p>As with all drugs containing sulfonamides, caution is advisable in patients with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Use in the Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)</span></span></p><p>AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for <span class="Italics">P. jiroveci</span> pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis<span class="Sup">5</span>. However, if a patient develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Co-administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and leucovorin should be avoided with <span class="Italics">P. jiroveci</span> pneumonia (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Electrolyte Abnormalities</span></span></p><p>High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with <span class="Italics">P. jiroveci</span> pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.</p><p>Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, particularly for the treatment of <span class="Italics">P. jiroveci</span> pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.</p><p>During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are “slow acetylators” may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Information for Patients</span></span></p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Laboratory Tests</span></span></p><p>Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued. Urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests should be performed during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Potential for Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim to Affect Other Drugs</span></p><p>Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Caution is recommended when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is co-administered with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.</p><p>In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported.</p><p>It has been reported that sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). This interaction should be kept in mind when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed.</p><p>Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of  phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect.</p><p>Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.</p><p>There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with co-administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients.</p><p>Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored.</p><p>Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin.</p><p>Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is prescribed.</p><p>The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when co-administered with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.</p><p>Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemics that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and glyburide) or eliminated renally <span class="Italics">via</span> OCT2 (e.g., metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted.</p><p>In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium has been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim  and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported.</p><p>In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor<span class="Sup">6,7</span>.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</span></span></p><p>Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).</p><p>The presence of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis:</span> Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26-week tumorigenic mouse (Tg-rasH2) study at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole; equivalent to 2.4-fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole <span class="Italics">b.i.d.</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis: In vitro</span> reverse mutation bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was negative. In <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim revealed no chromosomal abnormalities.</p><p>Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> reverse mutation bacterial assay and in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> micronucleus assays using cultured human lymphocytes.</p><p>Trimethoprim alone was negative in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> reverse mutation bacterial assays and in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assays with Chinese Hamster ovary or lung cells with or without S9 activation.

In mice following oral administration of trimethoprim, no DNA damage in Comet assays of liver, kidney, lung, spleen, or bone marrow was recorded.</p><p><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility:</span> No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were observed in rats given oral dosages as high as 350 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole plus 70 mg/kg/day trimethoprim doses roughly two times the recommended human daily dose on a body surface area basis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy</span></p><p>While there are no large, well-controlled studies on the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pregnant women, Brumfitt and Pursell<span class="Sup">8</span>,  in a retrospective study, reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4.5% (3 of 66) in those who received placebo and 3.3% (4 of 120) in those receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first trimester. In a separate survey, Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at the time of conception or shortly thereafter.</p><p>Because sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Teratogenic Effects</p><p>Pregnancy Category D.</p><p>Human Data</p><p>While there are no large prospective, well controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons and confounders. These studies are further limited by recall, selection, and information biases, and by limited generalizability of their findings. Lastly, outcome measures varied between studies, limiting cross-study comparisons. Alternatively, other epidemiologic studies did not detect statistically significant associations between sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim exposure and specific malformations.</p><p>Animal Data</p><p>In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area.</p><p>Nonteratogenic Effects</p><p>See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span> section.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Nursing Mothers:</span></span> Levels of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in breast milk are approximately 2% to 5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. Caution should be exercised when sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding, jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Use:</span></span> Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of age (see <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span> sections).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Geriatric Use:</span></span> Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><p>There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span> sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> section). The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Double Strength Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics</span>).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria). <span class="Bold">FATALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF SULFONAMIDES, ALTHOUGH RARE, HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO SEVERE REACTIONS, INCLUDING STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME, TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS, FULMINANT HEPATIC NECROSIS, AGRANULOCYTOSIS, APLASTIC ANEMIA AND OTHER BLOOD DYSCRASIAS (SEE WARNINGS SECTION).</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic</span>: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, hypoprothrombinemia, methemoglobinemia, eosinophilia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Allergic Reactions</span>: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis, allergic myocarditis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, drug fever, chills, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, serum sickness-like syndrome, generalized allergic reactions, generalized skin eruptions, photosensitivity, conjunctival and scleral injection, pruritus, urticaria and rash.

Signs and symptoms of overdosage reported with sulfonamides include anorexia, colic, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, drowsiness and unconsciousness. Pyrexia, hematuria and crystalluria may be noted. Blood dyscrasias and jaundice are potential late manifestations of overdosage.</p><p>Signs of acute overdosage with trimethoprim include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, mental depression, confusion and bone marrow depression.</p><p>General principles of treatment include the institution of gastric lavage or emesis, forcing oral fluids and the administration of intravenous fluids if urine output is low and renal function is normal. Acidification of the urine will increase renal elimination of trimethoprim. The patient should be monitored with blood counts and appropriate blood chemistries, including electrolytes. If a significant blood dyscrasia or jaundice occurs, specific therapy should be instituted for these complications. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective and hemodialysis is only moderately effective in eliminating sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.</p><p><span class="Italics">Chronic:</span> Use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at high doses and/or for extended periods of time may cause bone marrow depression manifested as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and/or megaloblastic anemia. If signs of bone marrow depression occur, the patient should be given leucovorin 5 to 15 mg daily until normal hematopoiesis is restored.</p><h2>Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Double Strength Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Urinary Tract Infections and Shigellosis in Adults and Pediatric Patients, and Acute Otitis Media in Children</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> The usual adult dosage in the treatment of urinary tract infections is 1 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim DS (double strength) tablet or 2 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets every 12 hours for 10 to 14 days.
