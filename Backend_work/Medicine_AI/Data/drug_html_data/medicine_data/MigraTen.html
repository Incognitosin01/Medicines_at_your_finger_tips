Acetaminophen is a pain reliever and a fever reducer. Caffeine is a stimulant that causes narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction). Isometheptene also causes narrowing of blood vessels. This is important in the treatment of headaches.</p><p>MigraTen is used to treat migraine headaches or severe tension headaches.</p><p>MigraTen may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had alcoholic liver disease (cirrhosis) or if you drink more than 3 alcoholic beverages per day.
