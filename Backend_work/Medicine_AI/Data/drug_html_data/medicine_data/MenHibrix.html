Hib infection usually affects children and can be fatal.</p><p>Meningococcal disease is a serious infection caused by a bacteria. Meningococcal bacteria can infect the blood, spinal cord, and brain, and can cause meningitis. These conditions can be fatal.</p><p>Haemophilus B and meningococcal disease can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The bacteria can also be passed through contact with objects the infected person has touched, such as a door handle, or other surface. The bacteria can also be passed through kissing, or sharing a drinking glass or eating utensil with an infected person.</p><p>MenHibrix works by exposing your child to a small dose of bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes your body to develop immunity to the disease. MenHibrix will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>MenHibrix is for use in children between the ages of 6 weeks and 18 months old.</p><p>Like any vaccine, MenHibrix may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Your child should not receive MenHibrix if he or she has ever had a life threatening allergic reaction to any meningococcal, haemophilus B, or tetanus vaccine.</p><p>Before your child receives MenHibrix, tell your doctor if the child has a weak immune system, if the child was born prematurely, or if the child has ever had Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks after receiving a vaccine that contains tetanus.</p><p>Your child can still receive a vaccine if he or she has a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until the child gets better before receiving MenHibrix.</p><p>Your child should not receive a booster vaccine if he or she had a life threatening allergic reaction after the first shot. Keep track of any and all side effects your child has after receiving MenHibrix. When the child receives a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>Be sure your child receives all recommended doses of MenHibrix. Your child may not be fully protected against disease if he or she does not receive the full series.</p><p>Becoming infected with haemophilus B influenzae or meningitis is much more dangerous to your child's health than receiving MenHibrix. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><h2>Before receiving MenHibrix</h2><p>Your child should not receive MenHibrix if he or she has ever had a life threatening allergic reaction to any meningococcal, haemophilus B, or tetanus vaccine.</p><p>If your child has any of these other conditions, MenHibrix may need to be postponed or not given at all:</p><ul>

<p>Guillain-Barré syndrome (within 6 weeks after receiving a vaccine that contains tetanus);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system caused by disease (such as cancer, HIV, or AIDS), or by taking certain medicines such as steroids; or</p>

Your child will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting.</p><p>MenHibrix is given in a series of 4 shots.

Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by your local health department.</p><p>Your child can still receive MenHibrix vaccine if he or she has a minor cold. In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until the child gets better before receiving MenHibrix.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend treating fever and pain with an aspirin free pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) when the shot is given and for the next 24 hours.
