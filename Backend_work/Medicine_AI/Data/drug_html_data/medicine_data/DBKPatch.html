The empirical formula for menthol is C<span class="Sub">10</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol. The chemical name is (1R,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol.  </p><p><span class="Italics">The structural formula</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">is:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">** Menthol **</span></p><p></p><p><span class="Italics">L</span><span class="Italics">idocai</span><span class="Italics">ne</span> is present in a 4% concentration (w/w). The molecular weight of lidocaine is 234.34 g/mol. It has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O and is chemically designated as 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide.</p><p><span class="Italics">The structural formula</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">is</span><span class="Italics">:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">**</span><span class="Italics"> </span><span class="Italics">Lidocaine</span><span class="Italics">**</span></p><p></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Menthol</span> has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it also acts as a weak kappa (κ) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol acts to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin - responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it stimulates when applied directly to the skin. Menthol's analgesic properties are not fully understood, however they are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.</p><p><span class="Italics">Lidocaine</span> is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.</p><h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Drug-drug interactions have not been clinically assessed with DBK Patch<span class="Sup">®</span></p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USE:</h2><p class="First">DBK Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> is a formulation used to aid patients in the pharmaceutical management of topical mild to moderate acute or chronic aches or pain. Muscle or joint pain can stem from many disease states - musculoligamentous strains, simple backache, tendonitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral neuropathies, such as diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia, and other complex regional pains.</p><p>This patch has also been used as adjunct therapy to certain types of headaches, but it is advised to use with caution when applying in order to avoid eye contact. If instructed otherwise by your practitioner, it may be used for other conditions as well.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Because of the possibility of sedation, patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of serious machinery or automobiles, and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Known hypersensitivity to menthol, lidocaine, or any of the topical amide-like anesthetic preparations.</p><h2>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, FERTILITY IMPAIRMENT:</h2><p class="First">Non-clinical toxicity studies to determine the potential of this topical preparation to cause carcinogenicity or mutagenicity have not been performed. The effect of the product on fertility has not been evaluated in animals.</p><h2>USE IN PEDIATRIC &amp; GERIATRIC POPULATION:</h2><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric and geriatric patients have not been established.</p><h2>PREGNANCY CONSIDERATIONS:</h2><p class="First">The safety of DBK Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> has not been established during pregnancy. There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Excessive dosage, or short interval between doses, can result in high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Patients should be instructed to strictly adhere to the recommended dosage and administration guidelines set forth in this literature and on your prescription label. The management of serious adverse reactions may require the use of resuscitative equipment, oxygen or other resuscitative drugs.</span></p><h2>LACTATION CONSIDERATIONS:</h2><p class="First">The effect of DBK Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> on the nursing infant has not been evaluated.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><ul>
<li>The most common adverse reactions are application site reactions, including dermatitis, itching or scaling. These tend to be dose-limiting and diminish with time.<br/></li>
<li>Serious adverse experiences following the administration of DBK Patch<span class="Sup">®</span> are similar in nature to those observed in other amide anesthetic-containing agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption, or may result from hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy, or a diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature.</li>
</ul><h2>PRODUCT STORAGE:</h2><p class="First">Store at room temperature at 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25° C). Protect from excessive moisture. Keep away from heat or sunlight.  The product can be considered safe and effective to use when maintained under these recommended conditions within the posted expiration date.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of over-dosage with DBK Patch<span class="Sup">®</span>. Signs of over-dosage would be consistent to those of other anesthetic-based preparations - vomiting, drowsiness, coma, respiratory depression, and seizures. In the case of an over-dosage, discontinue the product immediately, treat the patient symptomatically, institute supportive measures, and call 9-1-1 if necessary.</p><h2>HOW IS DBK Patch® SUPPLIED:</h2><ul>

The experiencing of acute or chronic topical pain is a reflection and the body’s method of telling you that something (potentially serious, potentially causing long term damage) needs attention. If the cause of recurrent pain is identified, the pain needs to be assessed by the appropriate healthcare professional, and a diagnosis made. This root cause diagnosis will dictate the course of treatment.</p><p>Lidocaine and menthol have been used separately for centuries to reap the pain relieving and numbing effects, however we have created a combination of the two that is absorbed through the dermal layer of the skin and instantly has a positive effect on the topical pain. The combination of these two ingredients is a highly effective combination that work together to lessen the discomfort, while the root cause is being managed and treated by your healthcare team.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics Underline">What side effects should I expect with</span> <span class="Bold Italics Underline">DBK</span> <span class="Bold Italics Underline">Patch</span><span class="Bold Italics Underline"><span class="Sup">®</span></span></p><ul>
