Individuals with allergic tendencies to these substances should use discretion.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Sup">*</span> The omega-3 fatty acids in this product are derived from non-fish sources. Because the omega-3 fatty acids in this product are not derived from fish, they are essentially free of oceanic toxins commonly found in fish and also do not contain any EPA.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INTERACTIONS:</span> Talk to your healthcare practitioner and/or pharmacist before taking or using any prescription or over-the-counter medicines or herbal/health supplements alongside <span class="Bold">Puralor<span class="Sup">®</span> Ci</span> . Folinic acid may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS: <span class="Bold">Puralor<span class="Sup">®</span> Ci</span></span> is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components contained in this product. <span class="Bold">Puralor<span class="Sup">®</span> Ci</span> is contraindicated for individuals with conditions for which any of the <span class="Bold">Puralor<span class="Sup">®</span> Ci</span> ingredients are contraindicated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> [PSYCHIATRY] Caution is recommended in patients with a history of bipolar illness. Mood elevation is possible in this population.</p><p>[ANTICONVULSANT] Caution is also recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as folate may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold. Furthermore, it has been reported that anticonvulsant medications interfere with folate metabolism, but the exact action is unclear; therefore caution is recommended with patients in this therapeutic group.</p><p>[GENERAL] Folinic acid may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly formyl-THF and fluorouracil. Concomitant granulocytopenia and fever were present in some but not all of the patients. The concomitant use of formyl-THF with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> pneumonia in patients with HIV infection was associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study.<span class="Sup">7</span></p><p>Individuals taking nitrates for the treatment of angina may experience severe headaches when taking NAC/NAC derivatives. Carbamazepine levels may be reduced when NAC is used with that drug.<span class="Sup">8</span> Patients at risk of developing renal stones, particularly cysteine stones, should avoid this product. Acetylcysteine clearance is reduced in preterm newborns as well as those with chronic liver disease. Do not administer to critically ill patients. Acetylcysteine and its sulfhydryl metabolites could produce a false-positive result in the nitroprusside test for ketone bodies used in diabetes. Acetylcysteine should be used with caution in those with a history of peptic ulcer disease since acetylcysteine may disrupt the gastric mucosal barrier.<span class="Sup">9</span></p><p>[ONCOLOGY] Patients undergoing cancer treatment should consult their licensed medical practitioner for advice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Folate alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><p>Daily ingestion of more than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids (ALA, EPA, and DHA) may have potential antithrombotic activities, or effects, and may increase bleeding times. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis, including those taking anticoagulants. Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral folate. Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema and the feeling of swelling of the entire body has been associated with cobalamin. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, transient skin rash, flushing, epigastric pain, and constipation have been associated with acetylcysteine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Call your medical practitioner about side effects. You may report side effects by calling (888) 886-2061.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">OMEGA-3 ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS AND LECITHINS</span> - Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are omega-3 fatty acids. The omega-3 fatty acid-derivatives in <span class="Bold">Puralor<span class="Sup">®</span> Ci</span> (as conjugated PC-DHA and conjugated PE-DHA/ “body ready” omega-3s) are uniquely conjugated to phospholipids – such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), which mimics the structure of fatty acids typically found in the healthy brain. Phospholipids are essential for neuronal and especially for synaptic structure and play key roles in the signal transduction responses to dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and acetylcholine. The unsaturated fatty acid components of phospholipids are abnormal in depression, with deficits of eicosapentaenoic acid and other omega-3 fatty acids.</p><p>Phosphatidylcholine-docosahexaenoic acid (PC-DHA) is the “body ready” derivative of DHA. Phosphatidylethanolamine-docosahexaenoic acid (PE-DHA) is the precursor to PC-DHA, and is a methylation-dependent process known as PE_methyltransferase (PEMTF) - which functions to sustain both PC synthesis in the liver and choline moiety production. Dopamine is involved in a receptor-mediated system. Specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in children with Attention Deficit Disorder including essential fatty acid derivatives. Higher levels of essential fatty acid derivatives improved cognitive performance in middle-aged adults.</p><p><span class="Bold">FOLATE</span> - Folate is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. It is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoiesis. It also promotes white blood cell (WBC) and platelet production in folate-deficiency anemia. Folate is associated with methylation and transformylation biochemistry.<span class="Sup">45</span></p><p>Folates are best known for reducing the incidence of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs).<span class="Sup">45</span> NTDs are congenital malformations produced by failure of the neural tube to form and close properly during embryonic development.<span class="Sup">10</span> During the first four weeks of pregnancy - when many women do not even realize that they have conceived, adequate maternal folate intake is essential to reduce the risk of NTDs. As the postnatal period approaches there is increased demand again for folate regardless of lactation status. Folate is involved in transformylation and methylation metabolism as well as - indirectly, succinylation metabolism (through the “methyl trap” hypothesis). Folate plays a central role in the formation of nucleic acid precursors, such as thymidylic acid and purine nucleotides, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and cell division. IOM/NAS (1998) noted that the evidence for a protective effect from folate supplements is much stronger than that for food folate.<span class="Sup">11</span> Other dietary ingredients are added to folate as cofactors, coenzymes and co-metabolites; in studies by Czeizel and Dudas (1992) and Berry et al. (1999), factors other than folate intake may affect the magnitude of risk reduction or participate in a co-protective effect with folate.<span class="Sup">11</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Puralor<span class="Sup">®</span> Ci</span> provides folate as DeltaFolate™ which contains:</p><p><span class="Bold">FOLIC ACID</span> CitraFolic<span class="Sup">®</span> is a novel, controlled-release delivery method to optimize absorption of folic acid. CitraFolic<span class="Sup">®</span> uses proprietary technology to encapsulate conventional folic acid, along with citrates, in controlled-release pellets. CitraFolic<span class="Sup">®</span> is unique from conventional folic acid in that it: 1.) complies with USP requirements for folic acid dissolution. Some studies indicate that dissolution failure - that is, the failure of conventional folic acid supplements to meet USP requirements for dissolution - is a significant, concerning problem.<span class="Sup">12</span> 2.) includes buffers to adjust the pH in order to remain soluble in a high acid environment, such as the gastric environment. This is important because folic acid must remain soluble in the acidic environment of the stomach in order to be absorbed in the intestine. Studies show that solubility of conventional folic acid decreases with increased acidity.<span class="Sup">13</span> Folic acid is converted into functional, metabolically active coenzyme forms for use in the body (61 Fed. Reg. at 8759-60), and supplies the active folate substrate, THF (tetrahydrofolate). Because the folate is controlled release (enteric coating delays 20 minutes then not less than 90% of folate is dissolved according to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) specifications within 60 minutes), it is less likely to interfere with heme iron (hemoglobin-derived iron) absorption as the body’s transport has a greater affinity for folic acid than for heme iron.<span class="Sup">47</span></p><p></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLINIC ACID</span> - Folinic acid plays an essential role in transformylation reactions, and is also the immediate precursor of L-5-MTHF substrate for B<span class="Sub">12</span>-assisted methionine synthase which remethylates homocysteine to methionine. Folinic acid is a metabolically active folate, and does not require reduction by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR is an extremely slow enzyme with some individuals possessing lower than average activity. Studies of patients with cerebral folate deficiency have shown that oral folinic acid can bypass defective folate receptors and restore central nervous system folate levels. Low folate status is associated with impaired cognitive function.<span class="Sup">14</span> Folinic acid represents nearly 30% of natural folates. Folinic acid is converted into functional, metabolically active coenzyme forms for use in the body (61 Fed. Reg. at 8759-60), and supplies the active folate substrate, THF (tetrahydrofolate).</p><p><span class="Bold">METHYLFOLIC ACID</span> - About 70% of food folate and cellular folate is comprised of L-methylfolate. It is the primary form of folate in circulation, and is also the form transported across membranes - particularly across the blood brain barrier - into peripheral tissues. In the cell, L-methylfolate is used in the remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate (THF). Elevated levels of homocysteine may induce oxidative stress, leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction.15 L-methylfolate is converted into functional, metabolically active coenzyme forms for use in the body (61 Fed. Reg. at 8759-60), and supplies the active folate substrate, THF (tetrahydrofolate).</p><p><span class="Bold">COENZYMES, COFACTORS AND CO-METABOLITES</span> - The following dietary ingredients are added to enhance the bioavailable potential of folate, and include:</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">COBALAMIN</span> - Cobalamin is required for two important reactions: the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA, a Krebs cycle intermediate, and the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, a reaction in which the methyl group of methyltetrahydrofolate is donated to remethylate homocysteine.<span class="Sup">45</span> Cobalamin deficiency, even in the absence of hematologic signs, may lead to impaired cognitive performance in adolescents. Decreased cobalamin status is strongly associated with cognitive dysfunction in the elderly.<span class="Sup">16</span> Many factors contribute to the cobalamin deficiency including diet, gastrointestinal pathology, autoimmune disease and medications.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">VITAMIN D</span> - Cholecalciferol is a form of vitamin D, also called vitamin D<span class="Sub">3</span>. Vitamin D receptors are widespread in brain tissue, and vitamin D's biologically active form has shown neuroprotective effects. Associations have been noted between low vitamin D status and Alzheimer's disease and dementia in both Europe and the US.<span class="Sup">22</span> Vitamin D deficiency is seen frequently among the elderly.<span class="Sup">23,45</span></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">B VITAMINS</span> - An association between inadequate vitamin B status and cognitive decline has been shown in studies. Mild subclinical vitamin deficiencies of niacin, thiamine, and riboflavin, are not uncommon in individuals with cognitive impairment.<span class="Sup">24</span> Emerging evidence suggests that thiamine deficiency produces alterations in brain function and structural damage that closely models a number of diseases in which neurodegeneration is a characteristic feature, including AD and PD; thus thiamine may have a role in AD and PD.<span class="Sup">25,45</span></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">COENZYME A</span> - Coenzyme A is a precursor to acetyl-coenzyme A which is involved in synthesis and oxidation of fats.<span class="Sup">45</span></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">VITAMIN C</span> - Vitamin C assists with folate metabolism. Studies also show that vitamin C may protect against cognitive impairment in some individuals.<span class="Sup">26</span></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">THREONATE</span> - L-threonate magnesium is a highly absorbable form of threonic acid that is able to increase brain magnesium levels. Elevation of brain magnesium may prevent cognitive deficits.<span class="Sup">27</span> Magnesium deficiency can arise from diminished intake of magnesium, such as observed in malnutrition and starvation. Another cause of magnesium deficiency is excessive magnesium excretion, such as seen in uncontrolled diabetes, severe diarrheal states, malabsorption, and diuretic therapy. Magnesium deficiency may affect vitamin D absorption.</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">MAGNESIUM</span> - Many neurodegenerative conditions have been reported to be associated with decreased brain magnesium levels<span class="Sup">17</span> and increased oxidative stress. Magnesium is an obligatory cofactor in glutathione synthesis. As a result, magnesium deficiency may impair glutathione synthesis. Magnesium concentrations have been shown to affect serotonin receptors, nitric oxide synthesis and release and NMDA receptors.<span class="Sup">18</span></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">NACA</span> - N-acetyl-l-cysteine amide is the amide form of acetylcysteine - an amino acid derivative that has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Acetylcysteine is a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione - the most prevalent circulating antioxidant. Oxidative stress has been implicated in cognitive disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI).<span class="Sup">28,29,45</span></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">ENZYME</span> - Papaya proteinase I is a protein-cleaving enzyme derived from papaya.<span class="Sup">45</span> Papaya proteinase I may free cobalamin from unabsorbable cobalamin complexes (cobalamin-R-proteins) formed in situations of pancreatic insufficiency. Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction is associated with impaired ileal absorption of cobalamin.</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">INTRINSIC FACTOR</span> - Intrinsic factor (IF) is a protein secreted by gastric parietal cells that facilitates absorption of cobalamin in the ileum. Once cobalamin is released into the intestinal lumen, it is taken up by intrinsic factor. The cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex is then absorbed by cells in the ileum, where the cobalamin is released and transported to the blood stream. Atrophic gastritis, reported to occur with a high prevalence in elderly patients, may result in decreased intrinsic factor secretion and consequently, impaired cobalamin absorption.<span class="Sup">30,45</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE REGULATION:</span> The Federal Register Notices from 1971 to 1973 established that increased folate was proper therapy in megaloblastic anemias of tropical and nontropical sprue, nutritional origin, pregnancy, infancy and childhood.<span class="Sup">32,33,34</span> Folate metabolism can be affected by malabsorption issues which differ widely among population groups. The March 5, 1996 Federal Register Notice (61 FR 8760) states that “The agency concluded that <span class="Bold Italics">the scientific literature did not support the superiority of any one source of folate over others, and that the data were insufficient to provide a basis for stating that a specific amount of folate is more effective than another amount</span> [emphasis added].”<span class="Sup">35</span> The actual amount and source of folate require a licensed medical practitioner’s supervision to achieve a satisfactory maintenance level, and may exceed the 0.8 mg UL. The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) specifically states that “dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription (21 CFR 121.1134). <span class="Bold Italics">Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription. Oral preparations supplying more than 0.8 mg of folate per dosage unit would be restricted to prescription dispensing</span> and that a dietary supplement furnishing 0.8 mg could be prescribed when a maintenance level of 0.8 mg per day was indicated. When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture and/or CSF folate levels have become normal, a maintenance level should be used. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent. In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased [emphasis added].”<span class="Sup">36</span> However, once the level of active folate exceeds 0.8 mg - as prescribed dosages, then the product is no longer a medical food but a <span class="Bold">prescription (R<span class="Sub">x</span>)-folate / dietary supplement</span> regardless of pregnancy/lactation status in spite of the fact that folic acid - including reduced forms, may be added to medical foods as defined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 USC 360ee(b)(3)), or to food (21 CFR 172.345).37,38 In the Letter Regarding Dietary Supplement Health Claim for Folic Acid, Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>, and Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> and Vascular Disease (Docket No. 99P-3029) dated November 28, 2000, FDA wrote “... high intakes of folate may partially and temporarily correct pernicious anemia while the neurological damage of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency progresses. IOM/NAS (1998) set the UL for all adults of 1 mg per day because of devastating and irreversible neurological consequences of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, the data suggesting that <span class="Bold Italics">pernicious anemia may develop at a younger age in some racial or ethnic groups, and the uncertainty about the extent of the occurrence of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency in <span class="Bold Underline">younger age groups</span></span> (IOM/NAS, 1998) [emphasis added].”<span class="Sup">39</span> Summary: This product is a prescription <span class="Bold">(R<span class="Sub">x</span>)</span> folate / dietary supplement product that - due to advanced folate levels, requires administration under the care of a licensed medical practitioner, and the most appropriate way to do that is to provide the product as prescription for pedigree reporting and safety monitoring.
