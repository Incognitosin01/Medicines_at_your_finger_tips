Comments:<br/>
-Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating therapy.<br/>
<br/>
Use: For adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy</p><p>Administration advice:<br/>
-Ilumya should only be administered by a healthcare provider.<br/>
-Before injection, remove carton from the refrigerator, and let the prefilled syringe (in the carton with the lid closed) sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br/>
-Follow the instructions on the carton to remove the prefilled syringe correctly, and remove only when ready to inject. Do not pull off the needle cover until you are ready to inject.<br/>
-Inspect the syringe visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The product is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if the liquid contains visible particles or the syringe is damaged. Air bubbles may be present; there is no need to remove them.<br/>
-Choose an injection site with clear skin and easy access (such as abdomen, thighs, or upper arm). Do not administer 2 inches around the navel or where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous, indurated, or affected by psoriasis. Do not inject into scars, stretch marks, or blood vessels.<br/>
-While holding the body of the syringe, pull the needle cover straight off (do not twist) and discard.<br/>
-Inject the full amount (1 mL), which provides 100 mg of drug per syringe.<br/>
-Press down the blue plunger until it can go no further. This activates the safety mechanism that will ensure full retraction of the needle after the injection is given.<br/>
-Remove the needle from the skin entirely before letting go of the blue plunger. After the blue plunger is released, the safely lock will draw the needle inside the needle guard.<br/>
-If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible; thereafter, resume dosing at the regularly scheduled interval.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you miss a follow-up appointment and do not receive your dose, schedule another appointment as soon as possible.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving Ilumya?</h2><p>Do not receive a "live" vaccine while using Ilumya.

Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any medicine you start or stop using.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Popular FAQ</h2><p>Ilumya works by binding selectively to interleukin-23 (IL-23) which is a naturally occurring cytokine. IL-23 plays a key role in promoting inflammation and regulating other cytokines (such as IL-17) and inflammatory substances, such as TNF-α3-7. By blocking the effects of IL-23, Ilumya helps control the release of IL-17 and TNF-α, which reduces inflammation associated with psoriasis. It also decreases how many inflammatory cells are present within psoriatic lesions, helps prevent plaque formation, and resolves tissue damage.

<li>Ilumya was FDA approved in 2018  and Skyrizi was FDA approved in 2019.</li>
<li>Ilyumya is a brand name for tildrakizumab and Skyrizi is a brand name for risankizumab</li>
<li>The dose of Skyrizi is 150mg, but because each injection only contains 75mg, two injections must be given per dose. The dose of Ilumya is 100mg, and each injection contains 100mg therefore only one injection needs to be given each time</li>
<li>Ilumya needs to be administered by a healthcare professional; however, patients prescribed Skyrizi can be taught how to self-administer it at home.</li>
