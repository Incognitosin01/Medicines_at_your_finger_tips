Contrast agents are used to help provide a clear picture during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a special kind of diagnostic procedure. It uses magnets and computers to create images or "pictures'' of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, it does not involve radiation.</p><p>Perflubron is taken by mouth before MRI to darken bowel (intestines) images, which may help the doctor diagnose problems or diseases of the bowel.</p><p>Perflubron is to be used only by or under the supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using perflubron</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to perflubron or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of perflubron in children with use in other age groups, this agent is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Perflubron has been tested and has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this diagnostic test. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Blockage or perforation of the bowelâ€”Either of these conditions may allow perflubron to be absorbed into the body and possibly increase the risk of side effects</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of perflubron</h2><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of perflubron will be different for different patients.
