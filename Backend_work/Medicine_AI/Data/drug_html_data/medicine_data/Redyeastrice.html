Red yeast rice is also known as Cholestin, Hypocol, Xuezhikang, or Zhitai.</p><p>Red yeast rice supplements are not the same as red yeast rice that is sold in Chinese grocery stores.</p><p>Red yeast rice has been used in alternative medicine as a likely effective aid in reducing levels of "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) and triglycerides in the blood.</p><p>Red yeast rice has been used as a possibly effective aid in reducing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, or death in people with a history of heart attack.</p><p>Red yeast rice has also been used as a possibly effective aid in lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p>Red yeast rice has been used to treat high blood pressure. However, research has shown that red yeast rice may not be effective in treating this condition.</p><p>Other uses not proven with research have included: lowering cholesterol and blood sugar levels in people with diabetes, improving blood circulation, lowering liver enzymes associated with liver damage, and treating diarrhea, indigestion, or other stomach problems.</p><p>It is not certain whether red yeast rice is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. Red yeast rice should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.</p><p>Red yeast rice is often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.</p><p>Red yeast rice may also be used for purposes not listed in this product guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on the product label and package.

For this reason, red yeast rice supplements may produce the same side effects and drug interactions as statin cholesterol medications produce.</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers red yeast products that contain more than trace amounts of this statin-identical ingredient to be illegal and unapproved drugs. Red yeast rice products sold within the United States are formulated not to contain high levels of monacolin K. However, red yeast rice with higher levels of monacolin K are still available in other countries.</p><p>When considering the use of herbal supplements, seek the advice of your doctor. You may also consider consulting a practitioner who is trained in the use of herbal/health supplements.</p><p>If you choose to use red yeast rice, use it as directed on the package or as directed by your doctor, pharmacist, or other healthcare provider. Do not use more of this product than is recommended on the label.</p><p>Red yeast rice works best if you take it with food.</p><p>Do not inhale the powder from a red yeast rice capsule.
