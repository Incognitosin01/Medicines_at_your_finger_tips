This medicine may be used with steroids, azathioprine, basiliximab, or mycophenolate mofetil. Tacrolimus belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents.</p><p>When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Tacrolimus works by suppressing the immune system to prevent the white blood cells from trying to get rid of the transplanted organ.</p><p>Tacrolimus is a very strong medicine. It can cause side effects that can be very serious, such as kidney problems. It may also decrease the body's ability to fight infections. <i>You and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it</i>.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Astagraf XL</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Tacrolimus may lower your body's resistance and the vaccine may not work as well or you might get the infection the vaccine is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.</p><p>This medicine may increase your risk for developing a rare and serious virus infection with the BK polyoma virus.
