Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Never use Theo-24 in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed.</p><p><b>Theo-24 is not a rescue medicine for asthma or bronchospasm attacks.</b> Use only fast-acting inhalation medicine for an attack.

You may break a scored tablet in half if needed to get the correct dose.</p><p>Some tablets are made with a shell that is not absorbed or melted in the body. Part of this shell may appear in your stool. This is normal and will not make the medicine less effective.</p><p>Measure liquid medicine carefully. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>Your dose and the number of times you take Theo-24 daily will depend on the reason you are taking this medication.</p><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about whether to take your medication with food or on an empty stomach.</p><p>Your dose needs may change if you are ill, or if you switch to a different brand, strength, or form of this medicine.
