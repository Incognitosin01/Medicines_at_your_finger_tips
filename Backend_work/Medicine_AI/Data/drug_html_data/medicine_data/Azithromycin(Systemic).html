reappearance of allergic reaction may occur shortly after discontinuation of symptomatic treatment without further azithromycin exposure.</p><p>• Altered cardiac conduction: Macrolides (especially erythromycin) have been associated with rare QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes; consider avoiding use in patients with prolonged QT interval, congenital long QT syndrome, history of torsades de pointes, bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, uncompensated heart failure, or concurrent use of Class IA (eg, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (eg, amiodarone, dofetilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs known to prolong the QT interval.</p><p>• Cardiac risk: A retrospective cohort study done in Tennessee Medicaid patients demonstrated an increased cardiac risk with azithromycin relative to amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin, and similar risk compared to levofloxacin; notably, increased cardiac mortality (an estimated 47 additional deaths per 1 million 5-day courses of treatment compared to amoxicillin) was associated with higher baseline cardiovascular risk (Ray 2012); however, these data may not be generalizable to the population as a whole (Ray 1989). In another retrospective population study of US veterans, azithromycin was shown to significantly increase the risk of mortality and arrhythmia on days 1 to 5, but not on days 6 to 10 after dispensing the prescription (Rao 2014). In contrast, 2 additional large retrospective cohort studies did <b>not</b> demonstrate an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including all-cause mortality or cardiovascular death (Svanstrom 2013, Mortensen 2014). The implications of these data have yet to be determined.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>C. difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD); CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Bronchiolitis obliterans: When studied to prevent bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in patients with hematologic malignancy who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, rates of cancer relapse and mortality were increased among patients receiving long-term azithromycin, leading to early trial termination (Bergeron 2017; FDA Drug Safety Communication 2018).</p><p>• Gonorrhea/syphilis: May mask or delay symptoms of incubating gonorrhea or syphilis, so appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed prior to initiating a treatment regimen.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with preexisting liver disease; hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis (with or without jaundice), hepatic necrosis, failure, and death have occurred. Discontinue immediately if symptoms of hepatitis occur (malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal colic, fever).</p><p>• Myasthenia gravis: Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis; exacerbation and new onset of symptoms have occurred.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;10 mL/minute); increased gastrointestinal adverse effects may occur.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Infants: Use of azithromycin in neonates and infants &lt;6 weeks of age has been associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS); the strongest association occurred with exposure during the first 2 weeks of life; observe for nonbilious vomiting or irritability with feeding (Eberly 2015). The risks and benefits of azithromycin use should be carefully considered in neonates; some experts recommend avoidance except for in the treatment of pertussis or <i>C. trachomatis</i> pneumonia; specific risk-benefit ratio should be considered before use for <i>Ureaplasma</i> spp. eradication (Meyers 2020).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Oral suspensions: Immediate release and extended release suspensions are not interchangeable.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Liver function tests, CBC with differential.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Azithromycin crosses the placenta (Ramsey 2003).</p><p>The maternal serum half-life of azithromycin is unchanged in early pregnancy and decreased at term; however, high concentrations of azithromycin are sustained in the myometrium and adipose tissue (Fischer 2012; Ramsey 2003).</p><p>Azithromycin may be used as an alternative or adjunctive prophylactic antibiotic in females undergoing unplanned cesarean delivery (ACOG 199 2018).
