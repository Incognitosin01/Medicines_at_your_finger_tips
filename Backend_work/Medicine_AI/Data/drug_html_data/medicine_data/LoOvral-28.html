</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Lo/Ovral-28</h2><p>Norgestrel, ethinyl estradiol, and ferrous fumarate combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol, and when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.</p><p>This medicine also contains ferrous fumarate. Ferrous fumarate is an iron supplement.</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than birth control pills. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.</p><p>This medicine will not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Lo/Ovral-28</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

However, pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of this medicine in teenagers are not expected. This medicine may be used for birth control in teenage females but should not be used before the start of menstruation.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of norgestrel, ethinyl estradiol, and ferrous fumarate combination have not been performed in the geriatric population. This medicine is not indicated for use in elderly women.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.
