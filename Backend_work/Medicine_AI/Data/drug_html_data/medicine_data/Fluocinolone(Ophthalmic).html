Use with caution in patients with glaucoma. Monitor IOP in all patients; within 3 years postimplantation, most patients will require IOP lowering medications and/or filtering procedures to control IOP.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: May enhance development of secondary bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Not recommended in patients with a history of ocular herpes simplex (potential for reactivation). Use with caution in patients with a history of bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, or viral infections or the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella. In acute purulent conditions, may mask infection. Fungal and viral infections are of particular concern. If corneal ulceration persists, consider fungal infection.</p><p>• Ocular effects: Intravitreal injections have been associated with endophthalmitis, eye inflammation, increased intraocular pressure and retinal detachment. Monitor carefully after intravitreal injection. Complications may also include cataract formation, choroidal detachment, hypotony, vitreous hemorrhage, vitreous loss, and wound dehiscence. Procedure may cause optic nerve injury. Visual defects in acuity and field of vision may occur (lasting 1 to 4 weeks postoperatively). Late-onset endophthalmitis has been observed, often associated with surgical site integrity.</p><p>• Ocular effects: Retisert: Perforation may occur with topical steroids in diseases which thin the cornea or sclera. Steroid use may delay healing after cataract surgery and increase bleb formation incidence.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Ocular implant: Iluvien, Yutiq: In patients in whom the posterior capsule of the lens is absent or has a tear, implant may migrate into the anterior chamber.</p><p>• Ocular implant: Retisert: Recommend unilateral implantation only to minimize risk of postoperative infections developing in both eyes. Due to the potential for separation of the silicone cup reservoir from the suture tab, implant integrity should be monitored during eye exams. Assure tight closure of scleral wound and integrity of overlying conjunctiva at the wound site.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Iluvien, Yutiq: Following injection, monitor for increased intraocular pressure and endophthalmitis; check for perfusion of optic nerve head immediately after injection, tonometry within 30 minutes, and biomicroscopy between 2 to 7 days after injection.</p><p>Retisert: Periodically monitor integrity of implant by visual inspection; recurrence of uveitis (may indicate need for reimplantation); IOP.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal studies have not been conducted with this product; however, adverse events have been observed with corticosteroids in animal reproduction studies. Systemic absorption is below the limit of quantification following ocular administration.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat eye swelling.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
