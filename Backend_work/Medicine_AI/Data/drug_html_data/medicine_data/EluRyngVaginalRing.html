</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, CHCs, including EluRyng, should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for EluRyng Vaginal Ring</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOR VAGINAL USE ONLY</span></p><p>EluRyng™ is indicated for use by females of reproductive age to prevent pregnancy.</p><h2>EluRyng Vaginal Ring Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>2.1 How to Use EluRyng</h3><p class="First">To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, EluRyng must be used as directed <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. One EluRyng is inserted in the vagina. <span class="Bold">The ring is to remain in place continuously for three weeks.</span> It is removed for a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs. A new ring is inserted one week after the last ring was removed.</p><p>The user can choose the insertion position that is most comfortable to her, for example, standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down. The ring is to be compressed and inserted into the vagina. The exact position of EluRyng inside the vagina is not critical for its function. The vaginal ring must be inserted on the appropriate day and left in place for three consecutive weeks. This means that the ring should be removed three weeks later on the same day of the week as it was inserted and at about the same time.</p><p>EluRyng can be removed by hooking the index finger under the forward rim or by grasping the rim between the index and middle finger and pulling it out. The used ring should be placed in the foil pouch and discarded in a waste receptacle out of the reach of children and pets (do not flush in toilet).</p><p>After a one-week break, during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs, a new ring is inserted on the same day of the week as it was inserted in the previous cycle. The withdrawal bleed usually starts on Day 2 to 3 after removal of the ring and may not have finished before the next ring is inserted. In order to maintain contraceptive effectiveness, the new ring must be inserted exactly one week after the previous one was removed even if menstrual bleeding has not finished.</p><h3>2.2 How to Start Using EluRyng</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IMPORTANT: Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to the first use of </span><span class="Bold">EluRyng</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle:</span></p><p>The woman should insert EluRyng on the first day of her menstrual bleeding. EluRyng may also be started on Days 2 to 5 of the woman’s cycle, but in this case a barrier method, such as male condoms with spermicide, should be used for the first seven days of EluRyng use in the first cycle.</p><p><span class="Bold">Changing From a CHC:</span></p><p>The woman may switch from her previous CHC on any day, but at the latest on the day following the usual hormone-free interval, if she has been using her hormonal method consistently and correctly, or if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant.</p><p><span class="Bold">Changing From a Progestin-Only Method (progestin-only pill [POP], Implant, or Injection or a Progestin-Releasing Intrauterine System [IUS]):</span></p><p>The woman may switch from the POP on any day; instruct her to start using EluRyng on the day after she took her last POP. She should switch from an implant or the IUS on the day of its removal, and from an injectable on the day when the next injection would be due. In all of these cases, the woman should use an additional barrier method such as a male condom with spermicide, for the first seven days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Use After Abortion or Miscarriage:</span></p><p>The woman may start using EluRyng within the first five days following a complete first trimester abortion or miscarriage, and she does not need to use an additional method of contraception. If use of EluRyng is not started within five days following a first trimester abortion or miscarriage, the woman should follow the instructions for “No Hormonal Contraceptive Use in the Preceding Cycle.” In the meantime, she should be advised to use a non-hormonal contraceptive method.</p><p>Start EluRyng no earlier than four weeks after a second trimester abortion or miscarriage, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) </span>and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Following Childbirth:</span></p><p>The use of EluRyng may be initiated no sooner than four weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism in the postpartum period <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) </span>and <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p>Advise women who are breastfeeding not to use EluRyng but to use other forms of contraception until the child is weaned.</p><p>If a woman begins using EluRyng postpartum, instruct her to use an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, for the first seven days. If she has not yet had a period, consider the possibility of ovulation and conception occurring prior to initiation of EluRyng.</p><h3>2.3 Deviations from the Recommended Regimen</h3><p class="First">To prevent loss of contraceptive efficacy, advise women not to deviate from the recommended regimen. EluRyng should be left in the vagina for a continuous period of three weeks. Advise women to regularly check for the presence of EluRyng in the vagina (for example, before and after intercourse).</p><p><span class="Bold">Inadvertent Removal or Expulsion</span></p><p>EluRyng can be accidentally expelled, for example, while removing a tampon, during intercourse, or with straining during a bowel movement. EluRyng should be left in the vagina for a continuous period of three weeks. If the ring is accidentally expelled and is left outside of the vagina for <span class="Bold">less than three hours</span>, contraceptive efficacy is not reduced. EluRyng can be rinsed with cool to lukewarm (not hot) water and <span class="Bold">reinserted as soon as possible,</span> but at the latest within three hours. If EluRyng is lost, a new vaginal ring should be inserted and the regimen should be continued without alteration.</p><p>If EluRyng is out of the vagina <span class="Bold">for more than three continuous hours:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">During Weeks 1 and 2:</span> Contraceptive efficacy may be reduced. The woman should reinsert the ring as soon as she remembers. A barrier method such as male condoms with spermicides must be used until the ring has been used continuously for seven days.</p><p><span class="Bold">During Week 3:</span> The woman should discard that ring. One of the following two options should be chosen:</p><p>In either case, a barrier method such as male condoms with spermicides must be used until the new ring has been used continuously for seven days.</p><p>If EluRyng was out of the vagina for an unknown amount of time, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered. A pregnancy test should be performed prior to inserting a new ring.</p><p><span class="Bold">Prolonged Ring-Free Interval</span></p><p>If the ring-free interval has been extended beyond one week, consider the possibility of pregnancy, and an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, <span class="Bold">MUST</span> be used until EluRyng has been used <span class="Bold">continuously for seven days.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Prolonged Use of EluRyng</span></p><p>If EluRyng has been left in place for up to one extra week (i.e., up to four weeks total), the woman will remain protected. EluRyng should be removed and the woman should insert a new ring after a one-week ring-free interval.</p><p>If EluRyng has been left in place for longer than four weeks, instruct the woman to remove the ring, and rule out pregnancy. If pregnancy is ruled out, EluRyng may be restarted, and an additional method of contraception, such as male condoms with spermicide, <span class="Bold">MUST</span> be used until a new EluRyng has been used <span class="Bold">continuously for seven days.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Ring Breakage</span></p><p>There have been reported cases of EluRyng disconnecting at the weld joint. This is not expected to affect the contraceptive effectiveness of EluRyng. In the event of a disconnected ring, vaginal discomfort or expulsion (slipping out) is more likely to occur. Vaginal injury associated with ring breakage has been reported <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>2.4 In the Event of a Missed Menstrual Period</h3><h3>2.5 Use with Other Vaginal Products</h3><p class="First">EluRyng may interfere with the correct placement and position of certain female barrier methods such as a diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom. These methods are not recommended as back-up methods with EluRyng use.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic data show that the use of tampons has no effect on the systemic absorption of the hormones released by EluRyng.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">EluRyng (etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) is a non-biodegradable, flexible, transparent to translucent, colorless to almost colorless, combination contraceptive vaginal ring, with an outer diameter of 54 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 4 mm. It is made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers and magnesium stearate, and contains 11.7 mg etonogestrel and 2.7 mg ethinyl estradiol, USP. When placed in the vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day of etonogestrel and 0.015 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol, USP over a three-week period of use. EluRyng is not made with natural rubber latex.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not prescribe EluRyng to women who are known to have or use the following:</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><p class="First">Stop EluRyng use if an arterial thrombotic or venous thromboembolic event (VTE) occurs. Stop EluRyng use if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></p><p>If feasible, stop EluRyng at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism, and during and following prolonged immobilization.</p><p>Start EluRyng no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</p><p>The use of CHCs increases the risk of VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>Two epidemiologic studies<span class="Sup">1, 2, 3</span> that assessed the risk of VTE associated with the use of EluRyng are described below.</p><p>In these studies, which were required or sponsored by regulatory agencies, EluRyng users had a risk of VTE similar to Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) users (see Table 1 for adjusted hazard ratios). A large prospective, observational study, the Transatlantic Active Surveillance on Cardiovascular Safety of EluRyng (TASC), investigated the risk of VTE for new users, and women who were switching to or restarting EluRyng or COCs in a population that is representative of routine clinical users. The women were followed for 24 to 48 months. The results showed a similar risk of VTE among EluRyng users (VTE incidence 8.3 per 10,000 WY) and women using COCs (VTE incidence 9.2 per 10,000 WY). For women using COCs that did not contain the progestins desogestrel (DSG) or gestodene (GSD), VTE incidence was 8.9 per 10,000 WY.</p><p>A retrospective cohort study using data from 4 health plans in the US (FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases) showed the VTE incidence for new users of EluRyng to be 11.4 events per 10,000 WY, for new users of a levonorgestrel (LNG)-containing COC 9.2 events per 10,000 WY, and for users of other COCs available during the course of the study* 8.2 events per 10,000 WY.</p><p>* Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Estimates (Hazard Ratios) of Venous Thromboembolism Risk in Users of EluRyng </span><span class="Bold">Compared to Users of Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Epidemiologic Study (Author, Year of Publication) Population Studied</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Comparator Product(s)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hazard Ratios (HR) (95% CI)</span></p><p class="First">TASC (Dinger, 2012)</p><p>Initiators, including new users, switchers and restarters</p><p class="First">All COCs available during the course of the study <span class="Sup">*</span></p><p>COCs available excluding DSG- or GSD -containing OCs</p><p class="First">HR<span class="Sup">†</span>: 0.8</p><p>(0.5 to 1.5)</p><p>HR<span class="Sup">†</span>: 0.8</p><p>(0.4 to 1.7)</p><p class="First">FDA-funded Study in Kaiser Permanente and Medicaid databases</p><p>(Sidney, 2011)</p><p>First use of a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) during the study period</p><p class="First">COCs available during the course of the study<span class="Sup">‡</span></p><p>LNG/0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol</p><p class="First">HR<span class="Sup">§</span>: 1.1</p><p>(0.6 to 2.2)</p><p>HR<span class="Sup">§</span>: 1.0</p><p>(0.5 to 2.0)</p><p><span class="Sup">*</span> Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, ethynodiol diacetate, gestodene, levonorgestrel, norethindrone, norgestimate, or norgestrel</p><p><span class="Sup">†</span> Adjusted for age, BMI, duration of use, VTE history</p><p><span class="Sup">‡</span> Includes low-dose COCs containing the following progestins: norgestimate, norethindrone, or levonorgestrel</p><p><span class="Sup">§</span> Adjusted for age, site, year of entry into study</p><p>An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of CHCs is well-established. Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of CHCs compared to non-users, the rates associated with pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 1).</p><p>The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 women-years.</p><p>The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and after restarting a CHC following a break of at least four weeks. The risk of VTE due to CHCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs, for pregnant women, and for women in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Likelihood of Developing a VTE</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Sup">*</span>CHC=combination hormonal contraception</p><p><span class="Sup">**</span>Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10,000 WY.</p><p>Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in EluRyng, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.</p><p>Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke.</p><p>Use EluRyng with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p><h3>5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)</h3><p class="First">Cases of TSS have been reported by EluRyng users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the EluRyng users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of EluRyng and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.</p><h3>5.3 Liver Disease</h3><p class="First">Do not use EluRyng in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver<span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>. Discontinue EluRyng use if jaundice develops.</p><p><span class="Italics">Liver Tumors</span></p><p>EluRyng is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (&gt;8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>5.4 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with and without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as CHCs. Discontinue EluRyng prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span></span>. EluRyng can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>5.5 High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">EluRyng is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop EluRyng use if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women using CHCs and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.</p><h3>5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions of anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported during use of EluRyng. If anaphylaxis and/or angioedema is suspected, EluRyng should be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.<br/></p><h3>5.7 Vaginal Use</h3><p class="First">EluRyng may not be suitable for women with conditions that make the vagina more susceptible to vaginal irritation or ulceration. Vaginal/cervical erosion or ulceration in women using EluRyng has been reported. In some cases, the ring adhered to vaginal tissue, necessitating removal by a healthcare provider and in some instances (i.e., when the tissue had grown over the ring), removal was achieved by cutting the ring without incising the overlying vaginal tissue.</p><p>Some women are aware of the ring on occasion during the 21 days of use or during intercourse, and sexual partners may feel EluRyng in the vagina.</p><h3>5.8 Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among CHC users. Use of CHCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease.</p><p>A past history of CHC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent CHC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for CHC-related cholestasis.</p><h3>5.9 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are using EluRyng. CHCs may decrease glucose tolerance.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. Some women will have adverse lipid changes while on CHCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using CHCs.</p><h3>5.10 Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman using EluRyng develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue EluRyng if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of EluRyng in the case of an increased frequency or severity of migraine during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>5.11 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></p><p>Unscheduled bleeding (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using CHCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.</p><p>Bleeding patterns were evaluated in three large clinical studies. In the North American study (US and Canada, N=1,177), the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 7.2% to 11.7% during cycles 1-13. In the two non-US studies, the percentages of subjects with breakthrough bleeding/spotting ranged from 2.6% to 6.4% (Europe, N=1,145) and from 2.0% to 8.7% (Europe, Brazil, Chile, N=512).</p><p><span class="Italics">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></p><p>If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures.</p><p>Occasional missed periods may occur with the appropriate use of EluRyng. In the clinical studies, the percent of women who did not have withdrawal bleeding in a given cycle ranged from 0.3% to 3.8%.</p><p>If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><p>Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuing CHC use, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><h3>5.10 Inadvertent Urinary Bladder Insertion</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of inadvertent insertions of EluRyng into the urinary bladder, which required cystoscopic removal. Assess for ring insertion into the urinary bladder in EluRyng users who present with persistent urinary symptoms and are unable to locate the ring.</p><h3>5.13 Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue EluRyng use if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>5.14 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Cervix</h3><p class="First">EluRyng is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that CHCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that CHCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><p>Some studies suggest that CHCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><h3>5.15 Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of CHCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormones or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>5.16 Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is using EluRyng should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.</p><h3>5.17 Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>5.18 Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using EluRyng.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of CHCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling.</p><ul class="Disk">

Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include: phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between CHCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure.</p><p>Counsel women to use an alternative non-hormonal method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with EluRyng, and to continue back-up non-hormonal contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p><p>Note: EluRyng may interfere with the correct placement and position of certain female barrier methods such as a diaphragm or female condom. These methods are not recommended as back-up methods with EluRyng use <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><p>The serum concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol were not affected by concomitant administration of oral amoxicillin or doxycycline in standard dosages during 10 days of antibiotic treatment. The effects of other antibiotics on etonogestrel or ethinyl estradiol concentrations have not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of CHCs</span></span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20-25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. Concomitant administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma estrogen and/or progestin concentrations. Co-administration of vaginal miconazole nitrate and EluRyng increases the serum concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol by up to 40% <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) / Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non­-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Significant changes in the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and /or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). These changes may be clinically relevant in some cases.</p><h3>7.2 Effects of CHCs on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">CHCs containing ethinyl estradiol may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. CHCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid and temazepam. A significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</p><p>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of CHCs.</p><h3>7.3 Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer EluRyng with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>7.4 Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>EluRyng is contraindicated during pregnancy because there is no need for pregnancy prevention in a woman who is already pregnant. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not shown an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following maternal exposure to low dose CHCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in pregnant rats and rabbits with the administration of etonogestrel during organogenesis at doses approximately 300 times the anticipated daily vaginal human dose (~0.002 mg/kg/day).</p><p>No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in pregnant rats and rabbits with the co-administration of the combination desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol during organogenesis at desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol doses at least 2/5 times, respectively, the anticipated daily vaginal human dose (~0.002 desogestrel/0.00025 ethinyl estradiol mg/kg/day).</p><p>Discontinue EluRyng use if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In rats and rabbits at dosages up to 300 times the anticipated dose, etonogestrel is neither embryotoxic nor teratogenic. Co-administration of a maternally toxic dose of desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol to pregnant rats was associated with embryolethality and wavy ribs at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 40/130 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose (0.002 desogestrel/0.00025 ethinyl estradiol mg/kg/day). No adverse embryofetal effects were observed when the combination was administered to pregnant rats at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 4/13 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose. When desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol was given to pregnant rabbits, pre-implantation loss was observed at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 3/10 times, respectively, the anticipated vaginal human dose. No adverse embryofetal effects were observed when the combination was administered to pregnant rabbits at a desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol dose that was 2/5 times the anticipated vaginal human dose.</p><h3>8.2 Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Small amounts of contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites, including etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol are transferred to human milk. Harmful effects have not been observed in breastfed infants exposed to CHCs through breast milk. CHCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women.</p><p>When possible, advise the nursing mother to use non-estrogen-containing contraception until she has completely weaned her child. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for EluRyng and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from EluRyng or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of EluRyng have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">EluRyng has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.</p><h3>8.6 Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of EluRyng has not been studied. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) </span>and <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</span>].</span></p><h3>8.7 Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of EluRyng has not been studied.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose of CHCs. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea. If the ring breaks, it does not release a higher dose of hormones. In case of suspected overdose, all EluRyng rings should be removed and symptomatic treatment given.</p><h2>EluRyng Vaginal Ring Description</h2><p class="First">EluRyng (etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) is a non-biodegradable, flexible, transparent to translucent , colorless to almost colorless, combination contraceptive vaginal ring containing two active components, a progestin, etonogestrel (13-ethyl-17-hydroxy-11-methylene-18,19-dinor-17α-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one) and an estrogen, ethinyl estradiol, USP (19-nor-17α-pregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol). When placed in the vagina, each ring releases on average 0.120 mg/day of etonogestrel and 0.015 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol, USP over a three-week period of use. EluRyng is made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers (28% and 9% vinylacetate) and magnesium stearate and contains 11.7 mg etonogestrel and 2.7 mg ethinyl estradiol, USP. EluRyng is not made with natural rubber latex. EluRyng has an outer diameter of 54 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 4 mm. The molecular weights for etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, USP are 324.5 and 296.40, respectively.</p><p>The structural formulas are as follows:</p><h2>EluRyng Vaginal Ring - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Combination hormonal contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins.

</ul><p>Use an additional barrier contraceptive method (such as a male condom with spermicide) when you take medicines that may make EluRyng less effective. Since the effect of another medicine on EluRyng may last up to 28 days after stopping the medicine, it is necessary to use the additional barrier contraceptive method for that long to help prevent you from becoming pregnant. While using EluRyng, you should not use certain female barrier contraceptive methods such as a vaginal diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom as your back-up method of birth control because EluRyng may interfere with the correct placement and position of a diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom.</p><p>Some medicines and grapefruit juice may increase the level of ethinyl estradiol in your blood if used together, including:</p><ul class="Disk">

<li>non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (such as etravirine)</li>
<li>medicines to lower cholesterol such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin</li>
</ul><p>Hormonal birth control methods may interact with lamotrigine, a medicine used for seizures.

<li>Read the <span class="Bold">Instructions for Use</span> at the end of this Patient Information that comes with your EluRyng for information about the right way to use EluRyng.</li>
<li>Use EluRyng exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.</li>
<li>EluRyng is used in a 4-week cycle.
<ul class="Circle">
<li>Insert 1 EluRyng in the vagina and keep it in place for 3 weeks (21 days).
<p class="First">Regularly check that EluRyng is in your vagina (for example, before and after intercourse) to ensure that you are protected from pregnancy.</p>
</li>
<li>Remove the EluRyng for a 1-week break (7 days). During the 1-week break (7 days), you will usually have your menstrual period.
<p class="First">Note: Insert and remove EluRyng on the same day of the week and at the same time:</p>
<ul class="Circle">
<li>For example, if you insert your EluRyng on a Monday at 8:00 am, you should remove it on the Monday 3 weeks later at 8:00 am.</li>
<li>After your 1-week (7 days) break, you should insert a new EluRyng on the next Monday at 8:00 am.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While using EluRyng, you should not use certain female barrier contraceptive methods such as a vaginal diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom as your back-up method of birth control because EluRyng may interfere with the correct placement and position of a diaphragm, cervical cap or female condom.</li>
<li>Ring breakage has occurred when also using a vaginal product such as a lubricant or treatment for infection (see “What should I do if my EluRyng comes out of my vagina?”). Use of spermicides or vaginal yeast products will not make EluRyng less effective at preventing pregnancy.</li>
<li>Use of tampons will not make EluRyng less effective or stop EluRyng from working.</li>
<li>If EluRyng has been left inside your vagina for more than 4 weeks (28 days), you may not be protected from pregnancy and you should see your healthcare provider to be sure you are not pregnant. Until you know the results of your pregnancy test, you should use an extra method of birth control, such as male condoms with spermicide, until the new EluRyng has been in place for 7 days in a row.</li>
<li>Do not use more than 1 EluRyng at a time. Too much hormonal birth control medicine in your body may cause nausea, vomiting, or vaginal bleeding.</li>

This increased risk is highest when you first start using a combination hormonal birth control method or when you restart the same or different combination hormonal birth control method after not using it for a month or more. Talk with your healthcare provider about your risk of getting a blood clot before using EluRyng or before deciding which type of birth control is right for you.</p><p>In some studies of women who used EluRyng, the risk of getting a blood clot was similar to the risk in women who used combination birth control pills.</p><p>Other studies have reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use combination birth control pills containing desogestrel (a progestin similar to the progestin in EluRyng) than for women who use combination birth control pills that do not contain desogestrel.</p><p><span class="Bold">It is possible to die or be permanently disabled from a problem caused by a blood clot, such as heart attack or stroke.</span> Some examples of serious blood clots are blood clots in the:</p><ul class="Circle">
