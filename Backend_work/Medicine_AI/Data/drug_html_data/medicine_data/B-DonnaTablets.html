</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First">Each B-Donna™ Tablet contains:</p><p>Phenobarbital, USP..... 16.2 mg<br/>
Hyoscyamine Sulfate, USP..... 0.1037 mg<br/>
Atropine Sulfate, USP .....0.0194 mg<br/>
Scopolamine Hydrobromide, USP .....0.0065 mg</p><h2>INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:</h2><p class="First">Anhydrous Lactose, Calcium Stearate, Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Corn Starch, and Microcrystalline Cellulose.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">This drug combination provides natural belladonna alkaloids in a specific, fixed ratio combined with phenobarbital to provide peripheral anticholinergic/antispasmodic action and mild sedation.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">Based on a review of this drug by the National Academy of Sciences–National Research Council and/or other information, FDA has classified the following indications as: “possibly” effective:</p><p>For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute enterocolitis.</p><p>May also be useful as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of duodenal ulcer.</p><p>IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN CONCLUSIVELY WHETHER ANTICHOLINERGIC/ANTISPASMODIC DRUGS AID IN THE HEALING OF A DUODENAL ULCER, DECREASE THE RATE OF RECURRENCES OR PREVENT COMPLICATIONS.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis, etc.); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of the elderly or debilitated patient; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis especially if complicated by toxic megacolon; myasthenia gravis; hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis.</p><p>B-Donna™ is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Phenobarbital is contraindicated in acute intermittent porphyria and in those patients in whom phenobarbital produces restlessness and/or excitement.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">B-Donna™ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with B-Donna™. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p>In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids (fever and heatstroke due to decreased sweating).</p><p>Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful.</p><p>B-Donna™ may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work.</p><p>Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased.</p><p>Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to individuals known to be addiction prone or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological dependence upon drugs.</p><p>Since barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, they should be used with caution and initial doses should be small in patients with hepatic dysfunction.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><h3>GENERAL</h3><p class="First">Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia and hypertension.</p><p>Belladonna alkaloids may produce a delay in gastric emptying (antral stasis) which would complicate the management of gastric ulcer.</p><p>Do not rely on the use of the drug in the presence of complication of biliary tract disease.</p><p>Theoretically, with overdosage, a curare-like action may occur.</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category D</span><br/>
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with B-Donna™. There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks (see WARNINGS).</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when B-Donna™ is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>GERIATRIC USE</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients may react with symptoms of excitement, agitation, drowsiness, and other untoward manifestations to even small doses of the drug.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions may include xerostomia; urinary hesitancy and retention; blurred vision; tachycardia; palpitation; mydriasis; cycloplegia; increased ocular tension; loss of taste sense; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; suppression of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling; musculoskeletal pain; severe allergic reaction or drug idiosyncrasies, including anaphylaxis, urticaria and other dermal manifestations; and decreased sweating.</p><p>Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital.</p><p>Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect. In patients habituated to barbiturates, abrupt withdrawal may produce delirium or convulsions.</p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Winder Laboratories, LLC at 1-770-307-0702 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">The dosage of B-Donna™ should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient to assure symptomatic control with a minimum of adverse effects.</p><p><span class="Italics">B-Donna™ Tablets</span> - Adults: One or two B-Donna™ tablets three or four times a day according to condition and severity of symptoms.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">The signs and symptoms of overdose are headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, dilated pupils, hot and dry skin, dizziness, dryness of the mouth, difficulty in swallowing, and CNS stimulation.
