May depress the formation, release, and activity of endogenous chemical mediators of inflammation (kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins) through the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins (lipocortins) and sequential inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid.</p><p>Tazarotene is a synthetic, acetylenic retinoid which modulates differentiation and proliferation of epithelial tissue and exerts some degree of anti-inflammatory and immunological activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Plaque psoriasis:</b> Treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Pregnancy.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling: </i>Additional contraindications (not in the US labeling): Hypersensitivity to halobetasol, tazarotene, corticosteroids, retinoic compounds, or any component of the formulation; bacterial or fungal skin infections; eruptions following vaccinations; parasitic infections; seborrheic dermatitis; syphilis or tuberculosis skin manifestations; viral (eg, herpes simplex, vaccinia, varicella) lesions of the skin; women who may become pregnant.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Plaque psoriasis:</b> Topical: Lotion: Apply a thin layer to affected areas once daily; total dosage should not exceed 50 g/week. Discontinue therapy when control is achieved.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Topical: For external use only; not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use; do not apply to the face, groin, or axillae. Use of occlusive dressings is not recommended unless directed by a health care provider. Ensure affected areas are dry prior to application. Apply thin film to affected areas and rub in gently. Wash hands after application (unless treating hands).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Protect from freezing.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>See Individual agents.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Contact dermatitis (7%), excoriation of skin (2%), folliculitis (2%), skin atrophy (2%), exfoliation of skin (1%), skin rash (1%)</p><p>Local: Application site pain (3%)</p><p>Frequency not defined:</p><p>Dermatologic: Atrophic striae, skin photosensitivity, telangiectasia</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: HPA-axis suppression</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.</p><p>• Local effects: Local adverse reactions may occur (eg, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, folliculitis, contact dermatitis); may be irreversible. Local adverse reactions are more likely to occur with use of higher potency corticosteroids, occlusive dressings and/or prolonged use. If local adverse reactions develop, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy until skin integrity is restored. Do not restart if allergic contact dermatitis is identified. Avoid use on eczema.</p><p>• Ocular effects: Topical corticosteroids may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Monitor for ocular symptoms. Avoid contact with eyes.</p><p>• Photosensitivity: May cause photosensitivity; exposure to ultraviolet rays (including sunlight/sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized. Risk may be increased by concurrent therapy with known photosensitizers (thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides); use with caution. Daily sunscreen use and other protective measures recommended. Patients with sunburn should discontinue use until sunburn has healed.</p><p>• Skin infections: Use appropriate antibacterial or antifungal agents to treat concomitant skin infections; discontinue treatment if infection does not resolve promptly.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, or application to large surface areas.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Signs/symptoms of HPA axis suppression/adrenal insufficiency; bacterial or fungal skin infection; disease severity in plaque psoriasis during therapy (reduction in erythema, scaling, induration); clinical response and skin tolerance; pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to treatment in females of reproductive potential.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential. A negative pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to treatment; treatment should begin during a normal menstrual period. Adequate contraception should be used in females of reproductive potential.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on the tazarotene component, use in pregnancy is contraindicated.</p><p>Refer to individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat plaque psoriasis.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
