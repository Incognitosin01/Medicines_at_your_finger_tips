</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ondansetron ODT</h2><p class="First">Ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets are indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with:</p><ul>
<li>highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> .</li>
<li>initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.</li>
<li>radiotherapy in patients receiving either total body irradiation, single high-dose fraction to the abdomen, or daily fractions to the abdomen.</li>
</ul><p>Ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets are also indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.</p><h2>Ondansetron ODT Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage regimens for adult and pediatric patients are described in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.</p><p>Corresponding doses of ondansetron tablets, ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets, and ondansetron oral solution may be used interchangeably.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Indication</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage Regimen</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Highly Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy</span></p><p class="First">A single 24 mg dose administered 30 minutes before the start of single-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Moderately Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy</span></p><p class="First">8 mg administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent 8 mg dose 8 hours after the first dose.</p><p>Then administer 8 mg twice a day (every 12 hours) for 1 to 2 days after completion of chemotherapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Radiotherapy</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For total body irradiation:</span> 8 mg administered 1 to 2 hours before each fraction of radiotherapy each day.</p><p><span class="Bold">For single high-dose fraction radiotherapy to the abdomen:</span> 8 mg administered 1 to 2 hours before radiotherapy, with subsequent 8 mg doses every 8 hours after the first dose for 1 to 2 days after completion of radiotherapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">For daily fractionated radiotherapy to the abdomen:</span> 8 mg administered 1 to 2 hours before radiotherapy, with subsequent 8 mg doses every 8 hours after the first dose for each day radiotherapy is given.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Postoperative</span></p><p class="First">16 mg administered 1 hour before induction of anesthesia.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Indication</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage Regimen</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Moderately Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">12 to 17 years of age:</span> 8 mg administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent 8 mg dose 8 hours after the first dose.</p><p>Then administer 8 mg twice a day (every 12 hours) for 1 to 2 days after completion of chemotherapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">4 to 11 years of age:</span> 4 mg administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent 4 mg dose 4 and 8 hours after the first dose.</p><p>Then administer 4 mg three times a day for 1 to 2 days after completion of chemotherapy.</p><h3>Dosage in Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater), do not exceed a total daily dose of 8 mg <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Administration Instructions for Ondansetron Orally Disintegrating Tablets</h3><p class="First">With dry hands, GENTLY remove the tablet. IMMEDIATELY place the ondansetron orally disintegrating tablet on top of the tongue where it will dissolve in seconds, then swallow with saliva. Administration with liquid is not necessary.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Ondansetron Orally Disintegrating Tablets, USP are available containing 4 mg or 8 mg of ondansetron, USP.</p><ul>
<li>The 4 mg tablets are white to off-white, round, unscored tablets debossed with <span class="Bold">M</span> on one side of the tablet and <span class="Bold">732</span> on the other side.</li>
<li>The 8 mg tablets are white to off-white, round, unscored tablets debossed with <span class="Bold">M</span> on one side of the tablet and <span class="Bold">734</span> on the other side.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients:</p><ul>
<li>known to have hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to ondansetron or any of the components of the formulation <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</li>
<li>receiving concomitant apomorphine due to the risk of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of ondansetron; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes including QT interval prolongation have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.</p><p>Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10)]</span> .</p><h3>Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension</h3><p class="First">The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction.</p><p>Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.</p><h3>Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame). Each 4 mg and 8 mg orally disintegrating tablet contains 0.51 mg and 1.01 mg phenylalanine, respectively.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron was unclear in many cases.</p><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 4% of 300 adults receiving a single 24 mg dose of ondansetron orally in 2 trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) were: headache (11%) and diarrhea (4%).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported in 4 trials in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens) are shown in Table 3.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ondansetron 8 mg Twice Daily</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 242)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 262)</span></p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">58 (24%)</p><p class="First">34 (13%)</p><p class="First">Malaise/fatigue</p><p class="First">32 (13%)</p><p class="First">6 (2%)</p><p class="First">Constipation</p><p class="First">22 (9%)</p><p class="First">1 (&lt; 1%)</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">15 (6%)</p><p class="First">10 (4%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System:</span><span class="Italics"> </span>Extrapyramidal reactions (less than 1% of patients).</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic:</span> Aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT) values exceeded twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 1% to 2% of 723 patients receiving ondansetron and cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in U.S. clinical trials. The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy. On repeat exposure, similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses, but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur. The role of cancer chemotherapy in these biochemical changes is unclear.</p><p>Liver failure and death has been reported in cancer patients receiving concurrent medications, including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear.</p><p><span class="Bold">Integumentary:</span><span class="Italics"> </span>Rash (approximately 1% of patients).</p><p><span class="Bold">Other (less than 2%):</span><span class="Italics"> </span>Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, tachycardia, angina, hypokalemia, electrocardiographic alterations, vascular occlusive events, and grand mal seizures. Except for bronchospasm and anaphylaxis, the relationship to ondansetron is unclear.</p><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 2%) reported in patients receiving ondansetron and concurrent radiotherapy were similar to those reported in patients receiving ondansetron and concurrent chemotherapy and were headache, constipation, and diarrhea.</p><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions reported in adults in trial(s) of prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting are shown in Table 4.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular: </span></span>Arrhythmias (including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, electrocardiographic alterations (including second-degree heart block, QT/QTc interval prolongation, and ST segment depression), palpitations, and syncope. Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron, transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">General: </span></span>Flushing. Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes severe (e.g., anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, shortness of breath, hypotension, laryngeal edema, stridor) have also been reported.</p><p>Laryngospasm, shock, and cardiopulmonary arrest have occurred during allergic reactions in patients receiving injectable ondansetron.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary: </span></span>Liver enzyme abnormalities.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lower Respiratory: </span></span>Hiccups.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Neurology: </span></span>Oculogyric crisis, appearing alone, as well as with other dystonic reactions.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Skin: </span></span>Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Eye Disorders: </span></span>Cases of transient blindness, predominantly during intravenous administration, have been reported. These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Monitor for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes</h3><p class="First">Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Tramadol</h3><p class="First">Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small trials indicate that when used together, ondansetron may increase patient-controlled administration of tramadol. Monitor patients to ensure adequate pain control when ondansetron is administered with tramadol.</p><h3>Chemotherapy</h3><p class="First">Carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.</p><p>In a crossover trial in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase systemic concentrations of high-dose methotrexate.</p><h3>Alfentanil and Atracurium</h3><p class="First">Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Available data do not reliably inform the association of ondansetron and adverse fetal outcomes. Published epidemiological studies on the association between ondansetron and fetal outcomes have reported inconsistent findings and have important methodological limitations hindering interpretation <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits did not show evidence of harm to the fetus when ondansetron was administered during organogenesis at approximately 6 and 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg/day, based on body surface area, respectively <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span> .</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First">Methodological limitations of the epidemiology studies preclude a reliable evaluation of the potential risk of adverse fetal outcomes with the use of ondansetron in pregnancy.</p><p>Two large retrospective cohort studies of ondansetron use in pregnancy have been published. In one study with 1,349 infants born to women who reported the use of ondansetron or received an ondansetron prescription in the first trimester, no increased risk for major congenital malformations was seen in aggregate analysis. In this same study, however, a sub-analysis for specific malformations reported an association between ondansetron exposure and cardiovascular defect (odds ratio (OR) 1.62 [95% CI (1.04, 2.14)]) and cardiac septal defect (OR 2.05 [95% CI (1.19, 3.28)]). The second study examined 1,970 women who received ondansetron prescription during pregnancy and reported no association between ondansetron exposure and major congenital malformations, miscarriage or stillbirth, and infants of low-birth weight or small for gestational age. Important methodological limitations with these studies include the uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription actually took the medication, the concomitant use of other medications or treatments, and other unadjusted confounders that may account for the study findings.</p><p>A case-control study evaluating associations between several common non-cardiac malformations and multiple antiemetic drugs reported an association between maternal use of ondansetron and isolated cleft palate (reported adjusted OR = 2.37 [95% CI (1.18, 4.76)]). However, this association could be a chance finding, given the large number of drugs-birth defect comparisons in this study. It is unknown whether ondansetron exposure <span class="Italics">in utero</span> in the cases of cleft palate occurred during the time of palate formation (the palate is formed between the 6 <span class="Sup">th</span> and 9 <span class="Sup">th</span> weeks of pregnancy) or whether mothers of infants with cleft palate used other medications or had other risk factors for cleft palate in the offspring. In addition, no cases of isolated cleft palate were identified in the aforementioned 2 large retrospective cohort studies. At this time, there is no clear evidence that ondansetron exposure in early pregnancy can cause cleft palate.</p><p class="First">In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of ondansetron up to 15 mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. With the exception of a slight decrease in maternal body weight gain in the rabbits, there were no significant effects of ondansetron on the maternal animals or the development of the offspring. At doses of 15 mg/kg/day in rats and 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits, the maternal exposure margin was approximately 6 and 24 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg/day, respectively, based on body surface area.</p><p>In a pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study, pregnant rats received oral doses of ondansetron up to 15 mg/kg/day from Day 17 of pregnancy to litter Day 21. With the exception of a slight reduction in maternal body weight gain, there were no effects upon the pregnant rats and the pre- and postnatal development of their offspring, including reproductive performance of the mated F1 generation. At a dose of 15 mg/kg/day in rats, the maternal exposure margin was approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg/day, based on body surface area.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether ondansetron is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of ondansetron on the breast fed infant or the effects on milk production. However, it has been demonstrated that ondansetron is present in the milk of rats.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ondansetron and any potential adverse effects on the breast fed infant from ondansetron or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron have been established in pediatric patients 4 years and older for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Use of ondansetron in these age-groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of ondansetron in adults with additional data from 3 open-label, uncontrolled, non-U.S. trials in 182 pediatric patients aged 4 to 18 years with cancer who were given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span> .</p><p>Additional information on the use of ondansetron in pediatric patients may be found in ondansetron injection prescribing information.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron have not been established in pediatric patients for:</p><ul>
<li>prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.</li>
<li>prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy.</li>
<li>prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.</li>
</ul><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects enrolled in cancer chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting in U.S.- and foreign-controlled clinical trials, for which there were subgroup analyses, 938 (19%) were aged 65 years and older.</p><p>No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years of age and older and younger subjects. A reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half-life were seen in patients older than 75 years compared with younger subjects <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . There were an insufficient number of patients older than 75 years of age and older in the clinical trials to permit safety or efficacy conclusions in this age-group. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dosage adjustment is needed in elderly patients.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.</p><p>In patients with severe hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and the apparent volume of distribution is increased, resulting in a significant increase in the half-life of ondansetron. Therefore, do not exceed a total daily dose of 8 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with any degree of renal impairment (mild, moderate, or severe). There is no experience beyond first-day administration of ondansetron <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First">Animal studies have shown that ondansetron is not discriminated as a benzodiazepine nor does it substitute for benzodiazepines in direct addiction studies.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no specific antidote for ondansetron overdose. Patients should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy.</p><p>In addition to the adverse reactions listed above, the following adverse reactions have been described in the setting of ondansetron overdose: “Sudden blindness” (amaurosis) of 2 to 3 minutes’ duration plus severe constipation occurred in one patient that was administered 72 mg of ondansetron intravenously as a single dose. Hypotension (and faintness) occurred in a patient that took 48 mg of ondansetron tablets. Following infusion of 32 mg over only a 4-minute period, a vasovagal episode with transient second-degree heart block was observed. In all instances, the adverse reactions resolved completely.</p><p>Pediatric cases consistent with serotonin syndrome have been reported after inadvertent oral overdoses of ondansetron (exceeding estimated ingestion of 5 mg per kg) in young children. Reported symptoms included somnolence, agitation, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, flushing, mydriasis, diaphoresis, myoclonic movements, horizontal nystagmus, hyperreflexia, and seizure. Patients required supportive care, including intubation in some cases, with complete recovery without sequelae within 1 to 2 days.</p><h2>Ondansetron ODT Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets, USP is ondansetron base, the racemic form of ondansetron, and a selective blocking agent of the serotonin 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor type. Chemically it is 4H-Carbazol-4-one, 1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-9-methyl-3-[(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]-(±)-. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>The molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">18</span>H <span class="Sub">19</span>N <span class="Sub">3</span>O representing a molecular weight of 293.4.</p><p>Ondansetron, USP is a white to off-white powder.</p><p>Each 4 mg ondansetron orally disintegrating tablet for oral administration contains 4 mg ondansetron base. Each 8 mg ondansetron orally disintegrating tablet for oral administration contains 8 mg ondansetron base. Each ondansetron orally disintegrating tablet also contains the inactive ingredients aspartame, crospovidone, mannitol, peppermint flavor, silicon dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, and sorbitol. Ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets are an orally administered formulation of ondansetron which disintegrates on the tongue and does not require water to aid dissolution or swallowing.</p><h2>Ondansetron ODT - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron’s antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of emesis. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT <span class="Sub">3</span> receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma-prolactin concentrations.</p><p class="First">QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single-intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 19.5 (21.8) milliseconds and 5.6 (7.4) milliseconds after 15-minute intravenous infusions of 32 mg and 8 mg of ondansetron injection, respectively. A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between ondansetron concentration and ΔΔQTcF. Using the established exposure-response relationship, 24 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) ΔΔQTcF of 14.0 (16.3) milliseconds. In contrast, 16 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes using the same model had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) ΔΔQTcF of 9.1 (11.2) milliseconds. In this study, the 8 mg dose infused over 15 minutes did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Ondansetron is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes some first-pass metabolism. Mean bioavailability in healthy subjects, following administration of a single 8 mg tablet, is approximately 56%.</p><p>Ondansetron systemic exposure does not increase proportionately to dose. The area under curve (AUC) from a 16 mg tablet was 24% greater than predicted from an 8 mg tablet dose. This may reflect some reduction of first-pass metabolism at higher oral doses.</p><p class="First">Bioavailability is also slightly enhanced by the presence of food.</p><p class="First">Plasma protein binding of ondansetron as measured <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> was 70% to 76% over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Circulating drug also distributes into erythrocytes.</p><p class="First">Ondansetron is extensively metabolized in humans, with approximately 5% of a radiolabeled dose recovered as the parent compound from the urine. The metabolites are observed in the urine. The primary metabolic pathway is hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by subsequent glucuronide or sulfate conjugation.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In terms of overall ondansetron turnover, CYP3A4 played the predominant role. Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron, it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme (e.g., CYP2D6 genetic deficiency) will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron elimination.</p><p>Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity, these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron.</p><p class="First">A reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half-life are seen in patients older than 75 years compared to younger subjects <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span> .</p><p class="First">Gender differences were shown in the disposition of ondansetron given as a single dose. The extent and rate of absorption are greater in women than men. Slower clearance in women, a smaller apparent volume of distribution (adjusted for weight), and higher absolute bioavailability resulted in higher plasma ondansetron concentrations. These higher plasma concentrations may in part be explained by differences in body weight between men and women. It is not known whether these sex-related differences were clinically important.

However, the mean plasma clearance of ondansetron was reduced by about 50% in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min). The reduction in clearance was variable and not consistent with an increase in half-life <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span> .</p><p class="First">In patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced 2-fold and mean half-life is increased to 11.6 hours compared with 5.7 hours in healthy subjects.

However, this increase is not thought to be clinically relevant <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span> .</p><p class="First">Carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4)]</span> .</p><p class="First">Concomitant administration of antacids does not alter the absorption of ondansetron.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenic effects were not seen in 2-year studies in rats and mice with oral ondansetron doses up to 10 mg/kg per day and 30 mg/kg per day, respectively (approximately 4 and 6 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg per day, based on body surface area).</p><p>Ondansetron was not mutagenic in standard tests for mutagenicity.</p><p>Oral administration of ondansetron up to 15 mg/kg per day (approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 24 mg per day, based on body surface area) did not affect fertility or general reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting</h3><p class="First">In 2 randomized, double-blind, monotherapy trials, a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron was superior to a relevant historical placebo control in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>. Steroid administration was excluded from these clinical trials. More than 90% of patients receiving a cisplatin dose greater than or equal to 50 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> in the historical-placebo comparator, experienced vomiting in the absence of antiemetic therapy.</p><p>The first trial compared oral doses of ondansetron 24 mg as a single dose, 8 mg every 8 hours for 2 doses, and 32 mg as a single dose in 357 adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>. The first or single dose was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. A total of 66% of patients in the ondansetron 24 mg once-a-day group, 55% in the ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group, and 55% in the ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group, completed the 24-hour trial period with 0 emetic episodes and no rescue antiemetic medications, the primary endpoint of efficacy. Each of the 3 treatment groups was shown to be statistically significantly superior to a historical placebo control.</p><p>In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group ( <span class="Italics">P</span> = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span> .</p><p>In a second trial, efficacy of a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>, was confirmed.</p><p class="First">A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the U.S. in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin.

The initial dose of ondansetron injection ranged from 0.04 to 0.87 mg per kg (total dose of 2.16 mg to 12 mg) followed by the administration of oral doses of ondansetron ranging from 4 to 24 mg daily for 3 days. In these trials, 58% of the 170 evaluable patients had a complete response (no emetic episodes) on Day 1. In 2 trials, the response rates to ondansetron 4 mg three times a day in patients younger than 12 years was similar to ondansetron 8 mg three times daily in patients 12 to 18 years. Prevention of emesis in these pediatric patients was essentially the same as for adults.</p><h3>Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in 20 patients, 8 mg of ondansetron administered 1.5 hours before each fraction of radiotherapy for 4 days was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting induced by total body irradiation. Total body irradiation consisted of 11 fractions (120 cGy per fraction) over 4 days for a total of 1,320 cGy. Patients received 3 fractions for 3 days, then 2 fractions on Day 4.</p><p class="First">In an active-controlled, double-blind trial in 105 patients receiving single high-dose radiotherapy (800 to 1,000 cGy) over an anterior or posterior field size of greater than or equal to 80 cm <span class="Sup">2</span> to the abdomen, ondansetron was significantly more effective than metoclopramide with respect to complete control of emesis (0 emetic episodes). Patients received the first dose of ondansetron (8 mg) or metoclopramide (10 mg) 1 to 2 hours before radiotherapy. If radiotherapy was given in the morning, 8 mg of ondansetron or 10 mg of metoclopramide was administered in the late afternoon and repeated again before bedtime. If radiotherapy was given in the afternoon, patients took 8 mg of ondansetron or 10 mg of metoclopramide only once before bedtime. Patients continued the doses of oral medication three times daily for 3 days.</p><p class="First">In an active-controlled, double-blind trial in 135 patients receiving a 1- to 4-week course of fractionated radiotherapy (180 cGy doses) over a field size of greater than or equal to 100 cm <span class="Sup">2</span> to the abdomen, ondansetron was significantly more effective than prochlorperazine with respect to complete control of emesis (0 emetic episodes).
