After 30 minutes, examine the eye under the slit lamp for the presence of a yellow flare in the anterior chamber. If flare is not detected, instill 1 drop every 2 minutes for an additional 2 to 3 drops and recheck for flare. Repeat as necessary. Once the flare is observed, perform ultrasound pachymetry. If corneal thickness is &lt;400 microns, instill 2 drops every 5 to 10 seconds until the corneal thickness increases to ≥400 microns. Once the 400 micron threshold is met, irradiate the eye for 30 continuous minutes using the KXL System. During irradiation, instill riboflavin 5’-phosphate onto the eye every 2 minutes for the 30 minute irradiation period.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Corneal ectasia following refractive surgery; Keratoconus, progressive:</b> Adolescents ≥14 years: Ophthalmic: Instill 1 drop of viscous solution every 2 minutes for 30 minutes following debridement of the epithelium to a diameter of ~9 mm. After 30 minutes, examine the eye under the slit lamp for the presence of a yellow flare in the anterior chamber. If flare is not detected, instill 1 drop of viscous solution every 2 minutes for an additional 2 to 3 drops and recheck for flare. Repeat as necessary. Once the flare is observed, perform ultrasound pachymetry. If corneal thickness is &lt;400 microns, instill 2 drops of nonviscous solution every 5 to 10 seconds until the corneal thickness increases to ≥400 microns. Once the 400 micron threshold is met, irradiate the eye for 30 continuous minutes using the KXL System. During irradiation, instill riboflavin 5’-phosphate viscous solution onto the eye every 2 minutes for the 30-minute irradiation period.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For topical ophthalmic use; do not inject.
