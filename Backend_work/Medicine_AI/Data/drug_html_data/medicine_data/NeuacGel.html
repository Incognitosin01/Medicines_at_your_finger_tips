</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Neuac Gel</h2><h3>Indication</h3><p class="First">Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is indicated for the topical treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% has not been demonstrated to have any additional benefit when compared with benzoyl peroxide alone in the same vehicle when used for the treatment of non-inflammatory acne.</p><h2>Neuac Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Apply a thin layer of Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% to the face once daily, in the evening or as directed by the physician. The skin should be gently washed, rinsed with warm water, and patted dry before applying Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5%. Avoid the eyes, mouth, lips, mucous membranes, or areas of broken skin.</p><p>Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Gel, 1.2%/5%</p><p>Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is a white, opaque gel. Each gram of Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% contains 12 mg clindamycin phosphate (equivalent to 10 mg of clindamycin) and 50 mg benzoyl peroxide.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is contraindicated in those individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, any components of the formulation, or lincomycin. Anaphylaxis, as well as allergic reactions leading to hospitalization, has been reported in postmarketing use with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</p><h3>Colitis/Enteritis</h3><p class="First">Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is contraindicated in those individuals with a history of regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, or antibiotic-associated colitis [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Colitis</h3><p class="First">Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of clindamycin. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued.</p><p>Severe colitis has occurred following oral and parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death.</p><p>Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> and stool assay for <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> toxin may be helpful diagnostically.</p><h3>Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure</h3><p class="First">Benzoyl peroxide, a component of Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5%, may cause increased sensitivity to sunlight. Minimize sun exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps) following drug application. [<span class="Italics">See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>] Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reaction is described in more detail in the <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> section of the label:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Colitis [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>During clinical trials, 397 subjects used clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% once daily for 11 weeks for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris. All subjects were graded for facial local skin reactions (erythema, peeling, burning, and dryness) on the following scale: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. The percentage of subjects that had symptoms present before treatment (at baseline) and during treatment is presented in Table 1.</p><p>(Percentages derived by number of subjects receiving clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% with symptom score/number of enrolled subjects receiving clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%).</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Anaphylaxis, as well as allergic reactions leading to hospitalization, has been reported in postmarketing use with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%.</p><p>Urticaria, application site reactions, including discoloration have been reported.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Erythromycin</h3><p class="First">Avoid using Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% in combination with erythromycin-containing products due to its clindamycin component. In vitro studies have shown antagonism between erythromycin and clindamycin. The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known.</p><h3>Concomitant Topical Medications</h3><p class="First">Concomitant topical acne therapies should be used with caution since a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. If irritancy or dermatitis occurs, reduce frequency of application or temporarily interrupt treatment and resume once the irritation subsides. Treatment should be discontinued if the irritation persists.</p><h3>Neuromuscular Blocking Agents</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</p><h3>Topical Sulfone Products</h3><p class="First">Use of topical benzoyl-peroxide-containing preparations with topical sulfone products may cause skin and facial hair to temporarily change color (yellow/orange).</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5%. Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg per kg per day (240 and 120 times the amount of clindamycin in the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg per kg per day (100 and 50 times the amount of clindamycin in the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is excreted into human milk after topical application.</p><p>However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects ages 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>Neuac Gel Description</h2><p class="First">Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is a fixed combination product with two active ingredients in a white, opaque, aqueous gel formulation.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi-synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">34</span>ClN<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">8</span>PS. The structural formula for clindamycin phosphate is represented below:</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate has a molecular weight of 504.97 and its chemical name is methyl 7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-(1-methyl-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-4-propyl-L-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamido)-1-thio-L-<span class="Italics">threo</span>-α-D-<span class="Italics">galacto</span>-octopyranoside 2-(dihydrogen phosphate).</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide has a molecular weight of 242.23.</p><p>Each gram of Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% contains 10 mg (1%) clindamycin, as clindamycin phosphate, and 50 mg (5%) benzoyl peroxide in a base consisting of carbomer homopolymer (type B), hydrochloric acid, methylparaben, dimethicone, propylparaben, purified water and sodium hydroxide.</p><h2>Neuac Gel - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clindamycin:</span> Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibacterial [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Benzoyl Peroxide:</span> Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bacteriocidal and keratolytic effects, but the precise mechanism of action is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">A comparative trial of the pharmacokinetics of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% and 1% clindamycin solution alone in 78 subjects indicated that mean plasma clindamycin levels during the 4-week dosing period were less than 0.5 ng/mL for both treatment groups.</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid. Less than 2% of the dose enters systemic circulation as benzoic acid.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing protein synthesis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">In Vivo Activity:</span> No microbiology studies were conducted in the clinical trials with this product.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">In Vitro Activity:</span> The clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide components individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span>, an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this in vitro activity is not known.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Resistance:</span> There are reports of an increase of <span class="Italics">P. acnes</span> resistance to clindamycin in the treatment of acne. In patients with <span class="Italics">P. acnes</span> resistant to clindamycin, the clindamycin component may provide no additional benefit beyond benzoyl peroxide alone.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be a tumor promoter and progression agent in a number of animal studies. Benzoyl peroxide in acetone at doses of 5 and 10 mg administered twice per week induced squamous cell skin tumors in transgenic TgAC mice in a study using 20 weeks of topical treatment. The clinical significance of this is unknown.</p><p>In a 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study in mice, treatment with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% at doses up to 8,000 mg per kg per day (16 times the highest recommended adult human dose of 2.5 g clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%, based on mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span>) did not cause an increase in skin tumors. However, topical treatment with another formulation containing 1% clindamycin and 5% benzoyl peroxide at doses of 100, 500, or 2,000 mg per kg per day caused a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of keratoacanthoma at the treated skin site of male rats in a 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study in rats.</p><p>In a 52-week photocarcinogenicity study in hairless mice (40 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of observation), the median time to onset of skin tumor formation decreased and the number of tumors per mouse increased relative to controls following chronic concurrent topical treatment with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% and exposure to ultraviolet radiation.</p><p>Genotoxicity studies were not conducted with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%. Clindamycin phosphate was not genotoxic in <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> or in a rat micronucleus test. Benzoyl peroxide has been found to cause DNA strand breaks in a variety of mammalian cell types, to be mutagenic in <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> tests by some but not all investigators, and to cause sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells.</p><p>Studies have not been performed with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% or benzoyl peroxide to evaluate the effect on fertility. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg per kg per day of clindamycin (approximately 120 times the amount of clindamycin in the highest recommended adult human dose of 2.5 g clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%, based on mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span>) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In five randomized, double-blind clinical trials of 1,319 subjects, 397 used clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5%, 396 used benzoyl peroxide, 349 used clindamycin, and 177 used vehicle. Subjects were instructed to wash the face, wait 10 to 20 minutes, and then apply medication to the entire face, once daily in the evening before retiring. Clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% applied once daily for 11 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle, benzoyl peroxide, and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris in three of the five trials (Trials 1, 2, and 5). Subjects were evaluated and acne lesions counted at each clinical visit at Weeks 2, 5, 8, 11.</p><p>The primary efficacy measures were the lesion counts and the investigator's global assessment evaluated at Week 11. Percent reductions in inflammatory lesion counts after treatment for 11 weeks in these 5 trials are shown in Table 2.</p><p>The group treated with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% showed greater overall improvement in the investigator's global assessment than the benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and vehicle groups in three of the five trials (Trials 1, 2, and 5).</p><p>Clinical trials have not adequately demonstrated the effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel, 1.2%/5% versus benzoyl peroxide alone in the treatment of non-inflammatory lesions of acne.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Neuac<span class="Sup">®</span> (clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% is a white, opaque gel.
