Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.</p><p>This medicine comes in a kit containing 2 bisacodyl delayed-release tablets and a bottle of PEG-3350 with electrolytes in powder form. You will take the bisacodyl tablets first and then wait to have a bowel movement. Once you have a bowel movement, you will start using the PEG-3350 solution over a period of about 90 minutes.</p><p>Bisacodyl delayed-release tablets:</p><p>Do not crush, chew, or break the bisacodyl delayed-release tablets. Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water. Breaking the pill would cause too much of the drug to be released at one time.</p><p>You should have a bowel movement within 1 to 6 hours after taking the bisacodyl tablets. After your first bowel movement, start using the PEG-3350 and electrolyte solution.</p><p>Polyethylene glycol 3350 and electrolyte solution:</p><p>The PEG-3350 and electrolyte powder must be mixed with water before you take it. Fill the container with water up to the 2-liter mark. Place the cap on the bottle and shake it until the powder is completely dissolved.</p><p>A variety of flavor packs are provided with the PEG-3350 powder. Use only one pack to add flavor to the solution. You may also prepare the solution without a flavor pack. Do not add any extra flavorings such as sugar, honey, artificial sweetener, fruit juices, or other beverages.</p><p>Shake the liquid well just before you measure each dose. The usual dose of PEG-3350 solution is 8 ounces every 10 minutes. Drink the solution in the exact portions at the exact time intervals prescribed by your doctor.</p><p>Drink each portion as quickly as possible, rather than sipping it slowly. The first watery stool should appear within 1 hour after you start drinking the PEG-3350 and electrolyte solution.</p><p>You may store the mixed solution in a refrigerator but you must use it within 48 hours after mixing. Throw away any PEG-3350 solution you have not used within 48 hours after it was mixed.</p><p>PEG-3350 will produce watery diarrhea. Keep drinking the solution until you have consumed all 2 liters.</p><p>On the day of your colonoscopy or bowel exam, <b>do not eat solid food or drink anything other than clear liquids.</b> You may be instructed not to drink or eat anything before your medical test or procedure.
