</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of fentanyl buccal tablet, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of fentanyl buccal tablet.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl buccal tablet is essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>. Overestimating the fentanyl buccal tablet dosage can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. The substitution of fentanyl buccal tablet for any other fentanyl product may result in fatal overdose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Fentanyl buccal tablet could be fatal to individuals for whom it is not prescribed and for those who are not opioid-tolerant.</span></p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of fentanyl buccal tablet, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of fentanyl.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></span></p><h3>Increased Risk of Overdose in Children Due to Accidental Ingestion or Exposure</h3><p class="First">Death has been reported in children who have accidentally ingested transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl products.</p><p>Patients and their caregivers must be informed that fentanyl buccal tablet contains a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Healthcare providers and dispensing pharmacists must specifically question patients or caregivers about the presence of children in the home (on a full time or visiting basis) and counsel them regarding the dangers to children from inadvertent exposure.</p><p>Patients and their caregivers must be instructed to keep both used and unused dosage units out of the reach of children. While all units should be disposed of immediately after use, partially consumed units represent a special risk to children. In the event that a unit is not completely consumed it must be properly disposed as soon as possible <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><p>Detailed instructions for the proper storage, administration, disposal, and important instructions for managing an overdose of fentanyl buccal tablet are provided in the fentanyl buccal tablet <span class="Italics">Medication Guide</span>. Encourage patients to read this information in its entirety and give them an opportunity to have their questions answered.</p><h3>Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of fentanyl buccal tablet with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of fentanyl buccal tablet is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in fentanyl buccal tablet-treated patients may increase fentanyl plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using fentanyl buccal tablet with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in fentanyl buccal tablet-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of fentanyl buccal tablet until stable drug effects are achieved <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>Concomitant use of fentanyl buccal tablet with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease fentanyl plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl. When using fentanyl buccal tablet with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants (including Alcohol)</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of fentanyl buccal tablet with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when fentanyl buccal tablet is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">When prescribing, do not convert a patient to fentanyl buccal tablet from any other fentanyl product on a mcg per mcg basis as fentanyl buccal tablet and other fentanyl products are not equivalent on a microgram per microgram basis.</p><p>Fentanyl buccal tablet is not a generic version of other transmucosal immediate release fentanyl (TIRF) formulations. When dispensing, do not substitute a fentanyl buccal tablet prescription for any other TIRF formulation under any circumstances. Other TIRF formulations and fentanyl buccal tablet is not equivalent. Substantial differences exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of fentanyl buccal tablet compared to other fentanyl products including other TIRF formulations that result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption of fentanyl. As a result of these differences, the substitution of fentanyl buccal tablet or any other fentanyl product may result in a fatal overdose.</p><p>There are no safe conversion directions available for patients on any other fentanyl products except ACTIQ (Note: This includes oral, transdermal, or parenteral formulations of fentanyl.) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. Therefore, for opioid tolerant patients, the initial dose of fentanyl buccal tablet should always be 100 mcg. Individually titrate each patient's dose to provide adequate analgesia while minimizing side effects <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablet contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, fentanyl buccal tablet exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>.</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed fentanyl buccal tablet. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing fentanyl buccal tablet, and monitor all patients receiving fentanyl buccal tablet for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as fentanyl buccal tablet, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of fentanyl buccal tablet along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing fentanyl buccal tablet. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Access Program</h3><p class="First">Because of the risk for misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>, fentanyl buccal tablet is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Under the TIRF REMS Access program, outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe for outpatient use, pharmacies, and distributors must enroll in the program. For inpatient administration (e.g., hospitals, hospices, and long-term care facilities that prescribe for inpatient use) of fentanyl buccal tablet, patient and prescriber enrollment is not required.</p><p>Required components of the TIRF REMS Access program are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Healthcare professionals, who prescribe fentanyl buccal tablet for outpatient use, must review the prescriber educational materials for the TIRF REMS Access program, enroll in the program, and comply with the REMS requirements.</li>
<li>To receive fentanyl buccal tablet, outpatients must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement.</li>
<li>Pharmacies that dispense fentanyl buccal tablet must enroll in the program and agree to comply with the REMS requirements.</li>

</ul><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of fentanyl buccal tablet during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of fentanyl buccal tablet in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:</span> fentanyl buccal tablet-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of fentanyl buccal tablet <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:</span> Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating fentanyl buccal tablet and when fentanyl buccal tablet is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of fentanyl buccal tablet with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. This may occur within the recommended dosage range.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue fentanyl buccal tablet if serotonin syndrome is suspected.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablet may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of fentanyl buccal tablet. In patients with circulatory shock, fentanyl buccal tablet may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of fentanyl buccal tablet in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), fentanyl buccal tablet may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with fentanyl buccal tablet.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of fentanyl buccal tablet in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablet is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The fentanyl in fentanyl buccal tablet may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The fentanyl in fentanyl buccal tablet may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during fentanyl buccal tablet therapy.</p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablet may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.

An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Fentanyl buccal tablet is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including fentanyl buccal tablet, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor.

Maternal toxicity and a decrease in fetal weights were observed at 100 mcg/kg but no teratogenicity was seen in the study (100 mcg/kg dose is equivalent to 1.4-times the exposure of a single human dose of 800 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison). Fentanyl (50, 100, or 250 mcg/kg) was also administered subcutaneously to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis (GD 6-18). Maternal toxicity was noted at doses ≥100 mcg/kg. No teratogenicity was seen in the study (250 mcg/kg dose is equivalent to 7.5-times the exposure of a single human dose of 800 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison).</p><p>Fentanyl has been shown to embryocidal in pregnant rats at doses of 30 mcg/kg intravenously (0.4 times the 800 mcg dose of fentanyl buccal tablet on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) from GD 6 to 18 and 160 mcg/kg subcutaneously (2 times the 800 mcg dose of fentanyl buccal tablet based on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).

The high dose was approximately 6 times the human dose of 800 mcg fentanyl buccal tablet per pain episode on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis and produced mean steady-state plasma levels that are approximately 5 times higher than the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> observed following administration of 800 mcg dose of fentanyl buccal tablet in humans.</p><p>In a postnatal development study, pregnant rats were treated from GD 6 through lactation day (LD) 20 with subcutaneous doses of fentanyl (25, 50, 100, and 400 mcg/kg). Maternal toxicity was noted at doses ≥100 mcg/kg. A reduction in pup growth and delayed attainment of developmental indices were observed at ≥100 mcg/kg. No difference in the number of live pups/litter was seen at birth, however, pup survival at LD 4 was reduced to 48% at 400 mcg/kg and by LD 21 pup survival was reduced to 30% and 26% at 100 and 400 mcg/kg, respectively. During lactation, fentanyl-related clinical signs (decreased activity, skin cold to touch, and moribund appearance) were noted in the F1 pups, most prominently in the 400 mcg/kg group. Pups from this group also had significantly reduced body weights throughout the lactation period. The dose of fentanyl administered to rats at which no developmental toxicity in the F1 generation was seen was 50 mcg/kg which is approximately equal the exposure of a single human dose of 800 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Fentanyl is present in breast milk. One published lactation study reports a relative infant dose of fentanyl of 0.024%. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of fentanyl on the breastfed infant and the effects of fentanyl on milk production.</p><p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with fentanyl buccal tablet.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor infants exposed to fentanyl through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2) Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of fentanyl buccal tablet have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 304 patients with cancer in clinical studies of Fentanyl Buccal Tablets, 69 (23%) were 65 years of age and older. Patients over the age of 65 years tended to titrate to slightly lower doses than younger patients. Patients over the age of 65 years reported a slightly higher frequency for some adverse events specifically vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain. Therefore, caution should be exercised in individually titrating fentanyl buccal tablet in elderly patients to provide adequate efficacy while minimizing risk.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of fentanyl buccal tablet slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span>.</p><p>Fentanyl is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Insufficient information exists to make recommendations regarding the use of fentanyl buccal tablet in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. Fentanyl is metabolized primarily via human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system and mostly eliminated in urine. If the drug is used in these patients, it should be used with caution because of the hepatic metabolism and renal excretion of fentanyl.</p><h3>Sex</h3><p class="First">Both male and female opioid tolerant patients with cancer were studied for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. No clinically relevant sex differences were noted either in dosage requirement or in observed adverse reactions.</p><h3>Race</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic effects of race with the use of fentanyl buccal tablet have not been systematically evaluated. In studies conducted in healthy Japanese subjects, systemic exposure was generally higher than that observed in U.S. subjects.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablet contains fentanyl, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablet contains fentanyl, a substance with high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Fentanyl buccal tablet can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes physical withdrawal.</p><p>"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Fentanyl buccal tablet, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to the Abuse of Fentanyl Buccal Tablet</span></p><p>Fentanyl buccal tablet are for oral transmucosal use only. Abuse of fentanyl buccal tablet poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of fentanyl buccal tablet with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene) mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdose with fentanyl buccal tablet can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the re-establishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to fentanyl overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of fentanyl in fentanyl buccal tablet, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Fentanyl Buccal Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Fentanyl buccal tablet is an opioid agonist, intended for buccal mucosal administration.</p><p>Fentanyl buccal tablet is designed to be placed and retained within the buccal cavity for a period sufficient to allow disintegration of the tablet and absorption of fentanyl across the oral mucosa.</p><p>Fentanyl buccal tablet employs the OraVescent<span class="Sup">®</span> drug delivery technology, which generates a reaction that releases carbon dioxide when the tablet comes in contact with saliva. It is believed that transient pH changes accompanying the reaction may optimize dissolution (at a lower pH) and membrane permeation (at a higher pH) of fentanyl through the buccal mucosa.</p><p><span class="Bold">Active Ingredient:</span> Fentanyl citrate, USP is N-(1-Phenethyl-4-piperidyl) propionanilide citrate (1:1). Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound (octanol-water partition coefficient at pH 7.4 is 816:1) that is freely soluble in organic solvents and sparingly soluble in water (1:40). The molecular weight of the free base is 336.5 (the citrate salt is 528.6). The pKa of the tertiary nitrogens are 7.3 and 8.4.

Specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. Fentanyl produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem to both increases in carbon dioxide and to electrical stimulation.</p><p>Fentanyl causes miosis even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Fentanyl causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and in the duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Fentanyl produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioid agonists have been shown to have a variety of effects on the secretion of hormones. Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2])</span>. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been shown to be both inhibited and stimulated by opioids.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Concentration-Efficacy Relationships</span></p><p>The analgesic effects of fentanyl are related to the blood level of the drug, if proper allowance is made for the delay into and out of the CNS (a process with a 3- to 5-minute half-life).</p><p>In general, the effective concentration and the concentration at which toxicity occurs increase with increasing tolerance with any and all opioids. The rate of development of tolerance varies widely among individuals <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p>The minimum effective analgesic concentration of fentanyl for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing fentanyl plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression.

Systemic exposure to fentanyl following administration of fentanyl buccal tablet increases linearly in an approximate dose-proportional manner over the 100- to 800-mcg dose range.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following buccal administration of fentanyl buccal tablet, fentanyl is readily absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 65%. The absorption profile of fentanyl buccal tablet is largely the result of an initial absorption from the buccal mucosa, with peak plasma concentrations following venous sampling generally attained within an hour after buccal administration. Approximately 50% of the total dose administered is absorbed transmucosally and becomes systemically available. The remaining half of the total dose is swallowed and undergoes more prolonged absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>In a study that compared the absolute and relative bioavailability of fentanyl buccal tablet and ACTIQ (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate), the rate and extent of fentanyl absorption were considerably different (approximately 30% greater exposure with fentanyl buccal tablet) (Table 5).</p><p>Similarly, in another bioavailability study exposure following administration of fentanyl buccal tablet was also greater (approximately 50%) compared to Actiq.</p><p>Due to differences in drug delivery, measures of exposure (C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">0-tmax</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">0-inf</span>) associated with a given dose of fentanyl were substantially greater with fentanyl buccal tablet compared to ACTIQ (see Figure 1).

The mean oral volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) was 25.4 L/kg.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The metabolic pathways following buccal administration of fentanyl buccal tablet have not been characterized in clinical studies. The progressive decline of fentanyl plasma concentrations results from the uptake of fentanyl in the tissues and biotransformation in the liver. Fentanyl is metabolized in the liver and in the intestinal mucosa to norfentanyl by cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform. In animal studies, norfentanyl was not found to be pharmacologically active <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Disposition of fentanyl following buccal administration of fentanyl buccal tablet has not been characterized in a mass balance study. Fentanyl is primarily (more than 90%) eliminated by biotransformation to N-dealkylated and hydroxylated inactive metabolites. Less than 7% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, and only about 1% is excreted unchanged in the feces. The metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine, while fecal excretion is less important.</p><p>The total plasma clearance of fentanyl following intravenous administration is approximately 42 L/h.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sex</span></p><p>Systemic exposure was higher for women than men (mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were approximately 28% and 22% higher, respectively). The observed differences between men and women were largely attributable to differences in weight.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Race</span></p><p>In studies conducted in healthy Japanese subjects, systemic exposure was generally higher than that observed in U.S. subjects (mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were approximately 50% and 20% higher, respectively). The observed differences were largely attributed to the lower mean weight of the Japanese subjects compared to U.S. subjects (57.4 kg versus 73 kg).</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Fentanyl was evaluated for carcinogenic potential in a 104-week rat study and in a 6-month Tg.AC transgenic mouse study. In rats, doses up to 50 mcg/kg in males and 100 mcg/kg in females were administered subcutaneously and no treatment-related neoplasms were observed (doses are equivalent to 2.3- and 3.4-times the exposure of a single human dose of 800 mcg per pain episode, respectively, based on an AUC comparison). In a 26-week transgenic mice model (Tg.AC), at topical doses up to 50 mcg/dose/day, no increase in the occurrence of treatment-related neoplasms was observed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Fentanyl citrate was not mutagenic in the Ames reverse mutation assay in <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span> or <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>, or the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay. Fentanyl citrate was not clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>In a fertility study, female rats were administered fentanyl subcutaneously for 14 days prior to mating with untreated males at doses up to 300 mcg/kg and no effects on female fertility were observed. The systemic exposure at the dose of 300 mcg/kg was approximately 8.6 times the exposure of a single human dose of 800 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison. Males were administered fentanyl subcutaneously for 28 days prior to mating with untreated females at doses up to 300 mcg/kg. At 300 mcg/kg, adverse effects on sperm parameters, which affected fertility, were observed. These effects included decreased percent mobile sperm, decreased sperm concentrations as well as an increase in the percent abnormal sperm. The dose in males at which no effects on fertility were observed was 100 mcg/kg, which is approximately 5.7- times the exposure of a single human dose of 800 mcg per pain episode, based on an AUC comparison.</p><p>Fentanyl has been shown to impair fertility in rats at doses of 30 mcg/kg IV and 160 mcg/kg subcutaneously. Conversion to the human equivalent doses indicates that this is within the range of the human recommended dosing for fentanyl buccal tablet.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of fentanyl buccal tablet was demonstrated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in opioid tolerant patients with cancer and breakthrough pain. Patients considered opioid tolerant were those who were taking at least 60 mg of oral morphine daily, at least 25 mcg/hour of transdermal fentanyl, at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid daily for a week or longer.</p><p>In this trial, patients were titrated in an open-label manner to a successful dose of fentanyl buccal tablet. A successful dose was defined as the dose in which a patient obtained adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects. Patients who identified a successful dose were randomized to a sequence of 10 treatments with 7 being the successful dose of fentanyl buccal tablet and 3 being placebo. Patients used one tablet of study drug (either fentanyl buccal tablet or placebo) per breakthrough pain episode.</p><p>Patients assessed pain intensity on a scale that rated the pain as 0=none to 10=worst possible pain. With each episode of breakthrough pain, pain intensity was assessed first and then treatment was administered. Pain intensity (0-10) was then measured at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after the start of administration. The sum of differences in pain intensity scores at 15 and 30 minutes from baseline (SPID<span class="Sub">30</span>) was the primary efficacy measure.</p><p>Sixty-five percent (65%) of patients who entered the study achieved a successful dose during the titration phase. The distribution of successful doses is shown in Table 8. The median dose was 400 mcg.</p><p>The LS mean (SE) SPID<span class="Sub">30</span> for fentanyl buccal tablet-treated episodes was 3.0 (0.12) while for placebo-treated episodes it was 1.8 (0.18).</p><p class="First"></p><p>PID=pain intensity difference; SEM=standard error of the mean</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Fentanyl Buccal Tablets are supplied in individually sealed, child-resistant blister packages.
