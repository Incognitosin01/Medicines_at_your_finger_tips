</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For injection: 500 mcg as a sterile, amorphous yellow to orange, lyophilized powder in a single-dose vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Secondary Malignancy or Leukemia</h3><p class="First">The risk of developing secondary malignancies, including leukemia, is increased following treatment with dactinomycin.</p><h3>Veno-occlusive Disease</h3><p class="First">Severe and fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) can occur with dactinomycin. Risk factors for the development of VOD include age younger than 4 years or concomitant radiotherapy. After treatment with dactinomycin, monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of VOD; these include elevations in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly, weight gain, or ascites. If patients develop VOD, considering delaying next dose of dactinomycin. Resume, reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of reaction and disease being treated.</p><h3>Extravasation</h3><p class="First">Extravasation of dactinomycin can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulcerations and persistent pain requiring wide excision surgery followed by split-thickness skin grafting. If any signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately interrupt the injection or infusion. Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]</span>. Observe closely and consult plastic surgery if necessary based on severity of reaction.</p><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">Severe and fatal myelosuppression, which may include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia, can occur with dactinomycin. The nadir in neutrophil counts generally occurs 14 to 21 days after administration. Obtain complete blood counts prior to each treatment cycle. Delay next dose of dactinomycin if severe myelosuppression has not improved. Consider dose reduction for patients with prolonged myelosuppression based on severity of reaction and disease being treated.</p><h3>Immunizations</h3><p class="First">The safety with live viral vaccines following dactinomycin has not been studied and vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended before or during treatment.</p><h3>Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe mucocutaneous reactions, such as Steven-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), can occur with dactinomycin. Permanently discontinue dactinomycin in patients who experience a severe mucocutaneous reaction.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Abnormalities of renal function can occur with dactinomycin. Monitor creatinine and electrolytes frequently during dactinomycin therapy.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Hepatotoxicity can occur with dactinomycin. Monitor AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin prior to and during dactinomycin therapy.</p><h3>Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall</h3><p class="First">Dactinomycin can increase radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, myelosuppression, or erythema and vesiculation of the skin or buccal and pharyngeal mucosa. Reduce the dose of dactinomycin by 50% during concomitant radiation.</p><p>Radiation recall, affecting previously treated radiation fields, can occur in patients who receive dactinomycin after prior radiation therapy. Although the risk can occur with distant radiation exposure, the risk appears highest when dactinomycin is administered within two months of prior radiation.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, dactinomycin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of dactinomycin to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose.</p><p>Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with dactinomycin and for 3 months after the final dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
