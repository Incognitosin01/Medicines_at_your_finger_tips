However, this medicine does not cure arthritis and will help you only as long as you continue to take it .</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Lodine XL</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of etodolac capsules and tablets in children below 18 years of age. No studies have also been done on the relationship of etodolac extended-release tablets in children below 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups .</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of etodolac in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of etodolac than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require adjustment of dosage in patients receiving etodolac .</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
