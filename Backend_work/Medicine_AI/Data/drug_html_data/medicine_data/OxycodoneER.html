Continually reevaluate patients receiving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for the use of opioid analgesics. </p><p>Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require a dosage adjustment of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic. If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS dosage. Because steady-state plasma concentrations are approximated in 1 day, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS dosage may be adjusted every 1 to 2 days.</p><p>If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">There are no well-controlled clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy with dosing more frequently than every 12 hours. As a guideline for pediatric patients 11 years and older, the total daily oxycodone dosage usually can be increased by 25% of the current total daily dosage. As a guideline for adults, the total daily oxycodone dosage usually can be increased by 25% to 50% of the current total daily dosage, each time an increase is clinically indicated.</span></p><h3>2.6 Dosage Modifications with Concomitant Use of Central Nervous System Depressants</h3><p class="First">If the patient is currently taking a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and the decision is made to begin OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, start with one-third to one-half the recommended starting dosage of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, consider using a lower dosage of the concomitant CNS depressant, and monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.6</span><span class="Italics">),</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>2.7 Dosage Modifications in Geriatric Patients who are Debilitated and not Opioid-Tolerant</h3><p class="First">For geriatric patients who are debilitated and not opioid tolerant, start dosing patients at one-third to one-half the recommended starting dosage and titrate the dosage cautiously <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations</span> <span class="Italics">(</span><span class="Italics">8.5</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>2.8 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with hepatic impairment, start dosing patients at one-third to one-half the recommended starting dosage and titrate the dosage carefully. Monitor for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations, (</span><span class="Italics">8.6</span><span class="Italics">),</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>2.9 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</p><p>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED RELEASE TABLETS, HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</p><p>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</p><p>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</p><p>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Extended-release tablets: 40 mg 80 mg.</p><ul class="Disk">

As an opioid, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  Because extended-release products such as OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (</span><span class="Italics">9</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS.

Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</span></p><p>Abuse or misuse of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (</span><span class="Italics">10</span><span class="Italics">)].</span> </p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.

Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>
<p class="First">Complete a <span class="Bold">REMS-compliant education program</span> offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</p>

The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint .</p><h3>5.3 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (</span><span class="Italics">10</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Overestimating the OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone.  </p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><h3>5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">), Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>5.5 Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Concomitant use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS -treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS -treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS until stable drug effects are achieved <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Concomitant use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. When using OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)].</span><span class="Italics"> </span></span></p><h3>5.6 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result if OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are used concomitantly with alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepines sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</span></p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">), Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></span></p><h3>5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:</span> OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS -treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Elderly,</span> <span class="Bold">Cachectic</span><span class="Bold">, or Debilitated Patients:</span> Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS and when OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.6)]</span>. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</span></p><h3>5.8 Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</span></p><h3>5.9 Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. In patients with circulatory shock, OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in patients with circulatory shock.</span></p><h3>5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</span></p><h3>5.11 Difficulty in Swallowing and Risk for Obstruction in Patients at Risk for a Small Gastrointestinal Lumen</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">There have been post-marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick, or otherwise wet OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">There have been rare post-marketing reports of cases of intestinal obstruction, and exacerbation of diverticulitis, some of which have required medical intervention to remove the tablet. Patients with underlying GI disorders such as esophageal cancer or colon cancer with a small gastrointestinal lumen are at greater risk of developing these complications. Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen.</span></p><h3>5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</span></p><p>The oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS therapy.</span></p><h3>5.14 Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of oxycodone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.9), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].</span></p><p>Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g.., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS.  In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.</p><h3>5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS and know how they will react to the medication <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</span></p><h3>5.16 Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Not every urine drug test for “opioids” or “opiates” detects oxycodone reliably, especially those designed for in-office use. Further, many laboratories will report urine drug concentrations below a specified “cut-off” value as “negative”. Therefore, if urine testing for oxycodone is considered in the clinical management of an individual patient, ensure that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay is appropriate, and consider the limitations of the testing used when interpreting results.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Square">

An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is not recommended for use in women immediately prior to labor, when use of shorter-acting analgesics or other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilatation, which tends to shorten labor.

Published lactation studies report variable concentrations of oxycodone in breast milk with administration of immediate-release oxycodone to nursing mothers in the early postpartum period. The lactation studies did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse reactions. Lactation studies have not been conducted with extended–release oxycodone, including OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production.

Use of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in adults as well as an open-label study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 16 years. However, there were insufficient numbers of patients less than 11 years of age enrolled in this study to establish the safety of the product in this age group.</p><p>The safety of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in pediatric patients was evaluated in 155 patients previously receiving and tolerating opioids for at least 5 consecutive days with a minimum of 20 mg per day of oxycodone or its equivalent on the two days immediately preceding dosing with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. Patients were started on a total daily dose ranging between 20 mg and 100 mg depending on prior opioid dose. </p><p>The most frequent adverse events observed in pediatric patients were vomiting, nausea, headache, pyrexia, and constipation <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.4</span><span class="Italics">), Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.1</span><span class="Italics">), Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">) and Clinical Trials (</span><span class="Italics">14</span><span class="Italics">)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly subjects (greater than 65 years) the clearance of oxycodone was slightly reduced.

Of the total number of subjects (445) in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride controlled-release tablets, 148 (33.3%) were age 65 and older (including those age 75 and older) while 40 (9.0%) were age 75 and older. In clinical trials with appropriate initiation of therapy and dose titration, no untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride controlled-release tablets. Thus, the usual doses and dosing intervals may be appropriate for elderly patients. However, a dosage reduction in debilitated, non-opioid-tolerant patients is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who are not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration.

Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution.

Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors).  Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</p><p>When discontinuing OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, gradually taper the dosage using a patient specific plan that considers the following: the dose of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]</span>.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdose with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS will continue to release oxycodone and add to the oxycodone load for 24 to 48 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Oxycodone ER Description</h2><p class="First">OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are an opioid agonist supplied in 40 mg and 80 mg tablets for oral administration. The tablet strengths describe the amount of oxycodone per tablet as the hydrochloride salt. The structural formula for oxycodone hydrochloride is as follows:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">18</span> H<span class="Sub">21</span> NO<span class="Sub">4</span> • HCl                               MW 351.83</p><p>The chemical name is 4, 5α-epoxy-14-hydroxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-one hydrochloride.</p><p>Oxycodone is a white, odorless crystalline powder derived from the opium alkaloid, thebaine. Oxycodone hydrochloride dissolves in water (1 g in 6 to 7 mL). It is slightly soluble in alcohol (octanol water partition coefficient 0.7).</p><p>The 40 mg and 80 mg tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene oxide, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide.</p><p>The 40 mg tablets also contain polysorbate 80 and yellow iron oxide.</p><p>The 80 mg tablets also contain hydroxypropyl cellulose, yellow iron oxide and FD&amp;C Blue #2/Indigo Carmine Aluminum Lake.</p><h2>Oxycodone ER - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect to analgesia for oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in CO<span class="Sub">2</span> tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Overdosage (</span><span class="Italics">10</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Oxycodone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System </span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models.

OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS are designed to provide delivery of oxycodone over 12 hours.</p><p>Cutting, breaking, chewing, crushing or dissolving OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS impairs the controlled-release delivery mechanism and results in the rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone.</p><p>Oxycodone release from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS is pH independent. The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60% to 87%. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS to that from immediate-release oral dosage forms is 100%. Upon repeated dosing with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS in healthy subjects in pharmacokinetic studies, steady-state levels were achieved within 24-36 hours. Oxycodone is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily in the urine as both conjugated and unconjugated metabolites. The apparent elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">½</span>) of oxycodone following the administration of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS was 4.5 hours compared to 3.2 hours for immediate-release oxycodone.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>About 60% to 87% of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the central compartment in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability is due to low pre-systemic and/or first-pass metabolism.</p><p><span class="Italics">Plasma Oxycodone Concentration over Time</span></p><p>Dose proportionality has been established for OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS 40 mg and 80 mg tablet strengths for both peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and extent of absorption (AUC) <span class="Italics">(see Table</span> <span class="Italics">6</span><span class="Italics">)</span>. Given the short elimination t<span class="Sub">½</span> of oxycodone, steady-state plasma concentrations of oxycodone are achieved within 24-36 hours of initiation of dosing with OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. In a study comparing 10 mg of OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS every 12 hours to 5 mg of immediate-release oxycodone every 6 hours, the two treatments were found to be equivalent for AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and similar for C<span class="Sub">min</span> (trough) concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold">TABLE</span> <span class="Bold">6</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Mean [% coefficient of variation]</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effects</span></p><p>Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of oxycodone from OXYCODONE HCl EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Following intravenous administration, the steady-state volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) for oxycodone was 2.6 L/kg. Oxycodone binding to plasma protein at 37°C and a pH of 7.4 was about 45%. Once absorbed, oxycodone is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain. Oxycodone has been found in breast milk <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.4</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Oxycodone is extensively metabolized by multiple metabolic pathways to produce noroxycodone, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone, which are subsequently glucuronidated. Noroxycodone and noroxymorphone are the major circulating metabolites. CYP3A mediated <span class="Italics">N</span>-demethylation to noroxycodone is the primary metabolic pathway of oxycodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated <span class="Italics">O</span>-demethylation to oxymorphone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>Noroxycodone exhibits very weak anti-nociceptive potency compared to oxycodone, however, it undergoes further oxidation to produce noroxymorphone, which is active at opioid receptors. Although noroxymorphone is an active metabolite and present at relatively high concentrations in circulation, it does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier to a significant extent. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only at low concentrations and undergoes further metabolism to form its glucuronide and noroxymorphone. Oxymorphone has been shown to be active and possessing analgesic activity but its contribution to analgesia following oxycodone administration is thought to be clinically insignificant. Other metabolites (α- and ß-oxycodol, noroxycodol and oxymorphol) may be present at very low concentrations and demonstrate limited penetration into the brain as compared to oxycodone. The enzymes responsible for keto-reduction and glucuronidation pathways in oxycodone metabolism have not been established.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows: free and conjugated oxycodone 8.9%, free noroxycodone 23%, free oxymorphone less than 1%, conjugated oxymorphone 10%, free and conjugated noroxymorphone 14%, reduced free and conjugated metabolites up to 18%.

These differences are accompanied by increases in some, but not other, drug effects.

This was accompanied by an increase in sedation but not by differences in respiratory rate, pupillary constriction, or several other measures of drug effect.
