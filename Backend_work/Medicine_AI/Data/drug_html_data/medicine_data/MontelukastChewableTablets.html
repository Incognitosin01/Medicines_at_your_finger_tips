Because the benefits of montelukast sodium chewable tablets may not outweigh the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>, reserve use for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Asthma</h3><p class="First">Montelukast sodium should be taken once daily in the evening. The following doses are recommended:</p><p>    For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: 10 mg.</p><p>    For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5 mg chewable tablet.</p><p>    For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4 mg chewable tablet.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with asthma have not been established.</p><p>Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.</p><p>There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion.</p><h3>Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)</h3><p class="First">For prevention of EIB, a single dose of montelukast sodium should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. The following doses are recommended:</p><p>For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: 10 mg.</p><p>For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5 mg chewable tablet.</p><p>An additional dose of montelukast sodium should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting β-agonist. Safety and efficacy in patients younger than 6 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB.</p><h3>Allergic Rhinitis</h3><p class="First">For allergic rhinitis, montelukast sodium should be taken once daily. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs.</p><p>The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended:</p><p>    For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: 10 mg.</p><p>    For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5 mg chewable tablet.</p><p>    For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4 mg chewable tablet.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established.</p><p>The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended:</p><p>    For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: 10 mg.</p><p>    For pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age: one 5 mg chewable tablet.</p><p>    For pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age: one 4 mg chewable tablet.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established.</p><p>Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.</p><h3>Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis</h3><p class="First">Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one montelukast sodium dose daily in the evening.</p><p>Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to any component of this product.</p><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>Neuropsychiatric Events</h3><p class="First">Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with use of montelukast sodium. These postmarketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without a previous history of psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported after montelukast sodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>; however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NP events are currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify risk factors for or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use.</p><p>Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.3)]</span>. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium.</p><p>Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. In many cases, symptoms resolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore, continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur<span class="Italics">.</span><br/></p><h3>Acute Asthma</h3><p class="First">Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist.</p><h3>Concomitant Corticosteroid Use</h3><p class="First">While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids.</p><h3>Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.1)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Eosinophilic Conditions</h3><p class="First">Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylketonuric patients should be informed that the 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame), 0.674 mg and 0.842 mg per 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablet, respectively.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma</span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2,950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials.

Cumulatively, 289 pediatric patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, and 241 for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of montelukast sodium in the 8-week, double-blind, pediatric efficacy trial was generally similar to the adult safety profile. In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following events occurred with a frequency ≥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: pharyngitis, influenza, fever, sinusitis, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, otitis, viral infection and laryngitis.

In a 56-week, double-blind study evaluating growth rate in pediatric patients 6 to 8 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following events not previously observed with the use of montelukast sodium in this age group occurred with a frequency ≥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: headache, rhinitis (infective), varicella, gastroenteritis, atopic dermatitis, acute bronchitis, tooth infection, skin infection and myopia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 2 to 5 Years of Age with Asthma</span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 573 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age in single- and multiple-dose studies. Cumulatively, 426 pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 3 months, 230 for 6 months or longer and 63 patients for one year or longer in clinical trials. In pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following events occurred with a frequency ≥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis, influenza, rash, ear pain, gastroenteritis, eczema, urticaria, varicella, pneumonia, dermatitis and conjunctivitis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis</span></p><p>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2,199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo.

Treatment groups included montelukast sodium 5 mg once daily, placebo, and beclomethasone dipropionate administered as 168 mcg twice daily with a spacer device. For each subject, a growth rate was defined as the slope of a linear regression line fit to the height measurements over 56 weeks. The primary comparison was the difference in growth rates between montelukast sodium and placebo groups.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10 mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults.

The structural formula is:</p><p>Montelukast sodium, USP is a hygroscopic, optically active, white to off-white powder. Montelukast sodium, USP is freely soluble in ethanol, methanol and water and practically insoluble in acetonitrile.</p><p>Each 4 mg and 5 mg montelukast sodium chewable tablet, USP contains 4.2 mg and 5.2 mg montelukast sodium, USP, respectively, which are equivalent to 4 mg and 5 mg of montelukast, respectively. Both chewable tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: aspartame powder, cherry flavor, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, iron oxide red, magnesium stearate, mannitol and microcrystalline cellulose.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC<span class="Sub">4</span>, LTD<span class="Sub">4</span>, LTE<span class="Sub">4</span>) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span>) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis.</p><p>Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> at the CysLT<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor without any agonist activity.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD<span class="Sub">4</span> in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD<span class="Sub">4</span>-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.</p><p>The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 5 mg chewable tablet, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> is achieved in 2 to 2.5 hours after administration to adults in the fasted state. The mean oral bioavailability is 73% in the fasted state versus 63% when administered with a standard meal in the morning.</p><p>For the 4 mg chewable tablet, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> is achieved 2 hours after administration in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age in the fasted state.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 5 mg chewable tablet formulation was administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma was also demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 4 mg chewable tablet formulation was administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion.</p><p>The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5 mg chewable tablets versus one 10 mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></span></p><p>Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins.

Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and &lt;0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile.</p><p>In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10 mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Special Populations</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Insufficiency:</span> Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10 mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast sodium in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Insufficiency:</span> Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency.

The 5 mg chewable tablet should be used in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age and the 4 mg chewable tablet should be used in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age.</p><p>In children 6 to 11 months of age, the systemic exposure to montelukast and the variability of plasma montelukast concentrations were higher than those observed in adults. Based on population analyses, the mean AUC (4296 ng•hr/mL [range 1200 to 7153]) was 60% higher and the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> (667 ng/mL [range 201 to 1058]) was 89% higher than those observed in adults (mean AUC 2689 ng•hr/mL [range 1521 to 4595]) and mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> (353 ng/mL [range 180 to 548]).

Safety and tolerability of montelukast in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in 26 children 6 to 23 months of age were similar to that of patients two years and above <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The 4 mg oral granule formulation should be used for pediatric patients 12 to 23 months of age for the treatment of asthma, or for pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis. Since the 4 mg oral granule formulation is bioequivalent to the 4 mg chewable tablet, it can also be used as an alternative formulation to the 4 mg chewable tablet in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Theophylline, Prednisone and Prednisolone:</span> Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions.

Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady-state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady-state did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP3A4) or fexofenadine, the carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30 mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR).</p><p><span class="Italics">Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines and Decongestants:</span> Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast sodium was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions.

Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone and repaglinide). Based on further <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19 or 2D6.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzyme Inhibitors:</span> <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4.

Data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold.

Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p≤0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids.</p><p>In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period.

The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (Adults, Adolescents, and Pediatric Patients 6 years of age and older)</span></p><p>The efficacy of montelukast 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB.
