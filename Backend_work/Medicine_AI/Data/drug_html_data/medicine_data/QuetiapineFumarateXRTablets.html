The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet in schizophrenia was established in one 6-week and one maintenance trial in adults with schizophrenia. Efficacy was supported by three 6-week trials in adults with schizophrenia and one 6-week trial in adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) treated with quetiapine fumarate tablet <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Bipolar Disorder</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet is indicated for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet in manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder was established in one 3-week trial in adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Efficacy was supported by two 12-week monotherapy trials and one 3-week adjunctive trial in adults with manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder as well as one 3-week monotherapy trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years) with manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder treated with quetiapine fumarate tablet <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)]</span>.</p><p>Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet is indicated for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet was established in one 8-week trial in adults with bipolar I or II disorder and supported by two 8-week trials in adults with bipolar I or II disorder treated with quetiapine fumarate tablet <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)].</span></p><p>Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet is indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was extrapolated from two maintenance trials in adults with bipolar I disorder treated with quetiapine fumarate tablet. The effectiveness of monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)].</span></p><h3>Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD. The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in MDD was established in two 6-week trials in adults with MDD who had an inadequate response to antidepressant treatment <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder</h3><p class="First">Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders, however, diagnosis can be challenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.</p><h2>Quetiapine Fumarate XR Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole and not split, chewed or crushed.</p><p>It is recommended that quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet be taken without food or with a light meal (approximately 300 calories) <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].</span></p><p>Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet should be administered once daily, preferably in the evening.</p><h3>Recommended Dosing</h3><p class="First">The recommended initial dose, titration, dose range and maximum quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet dose for each approved indication is displayed in Table 1 below.

The dose can be increased daily in increments of 50 mg/day to an effective dose, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patient.</p><h3>Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet dose should be reduced to one sixth of original dose when co-medicated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.). When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet should be increased by 6 fold <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) and DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1)].</span></p><h3>Dose Modifications when used with CYP3A4 Inducers</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet dose should be increased up to 5 fold of the original dose when used in combination with a chronic treatment (e.g., greater than 7 to 14 days) of a potent CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John's wort etc.). The dose should be titrated based on the clinical response and tolerance of the individual patient. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet should be reduced to the original level within 7 to 14 days <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].</span></p><h3>Re-initiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued</h3><p class="First">Although there are no data to specifically address re-initiation of treatment, it is recommended that when restarting therapy of patients who have been off quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet for more than one week, the initial dosing schedule should be followed. When restarting patients who have been off quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet for less than one week, gradual dose escalation may not be required and the maintenance dose may be re-initiated.</p><h3>Switching Patients from Quetiapine Fumarate Tablets to Quetiapine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First">Patients who are currently being treated with quetiapine fumarate tablets (immediate release formulation) may be switched to quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet at the equivalent total daily dose taken once daily. Individual dosage adjustments may be necessary.</p><h3>Switching from Antipsychotics</h3><p class="First">There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from other antipsychotics to quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal syndrome medication should be re-evaluated periodically.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">   •   50 mg extended-release tablets are peach to red colored, capsule shaped, biconvex, film coated tablets debossed with "LU" on one side and "K71" on the other side.</p><p>   •   150 mg extended-release tablets are white colored, capsule shaped, biconvex, film coated tablets debossed with "LU" on one side and "K72" on the other side.</p><p>   •   200 mg extended-release tablets are yellow colored, capsule shaped, biconvex, film coated tablets debossed with "LU" on one side and "K73" on the other side.</p><p>   •   300 mg extended-release tablets are pale yellow colored, capsule shaped, biconvex, film coated tablets debossed with "LU" on one side and "K74" on the other side.</p><p>   •   400 mg extended-release tablets are white colored, capsule shaped, biconvex, film coated tablets debossed with "LU" on one side and "K75" on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to quetiapine or to any excipients in the quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet formulation. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see BOXED WARNING].</span></p><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults</h3><p class="First">Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Age Range</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Increases Compared to Placebo</span><br/></p><p class="First">&lt;18<br/></p><p class="First">14 additional cases<br/></p><p class="First">18 to 24<br/></p><p class="First">5 additional cases<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Decreases Compared to Placebo</span><br/></p><p class="First">25 to 64<br/></p><p class="First">1 fewer case<br/></p><p class="First">≥65<br/></p><p class="First">6 fewer cases<br/></p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p><p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.</span> Prescriptions for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</span></span></p><p>A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].</span></p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant System NMS</h3><p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</p><p>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.</p><p>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose, and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these metabolic profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus</span></span></p><p>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.</p><p>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adults:</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Analyte</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Category Change</span><br/>

After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean increase in body weight was 4.4 kg. Forty-five percent of the patients gained ≥ 7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. In order to adjust for normal growth over 26 weeks, an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change; 18.3% of patients on quetiapine fumarate tablet met this criterion after 26 weeks of treatment.</p><p>When treating pediatric patients with quetiapine fumarate tablet for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected for normal growth.</p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First">A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</p><p>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.</p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Tardive dyskinesia, may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</span></p><p>Given these considerations, quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p><p>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with quetiapine despite the presence of the syndrome.</p><h3>Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its α1-adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 0.3% (5/1866) of the patients treated with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet across all indications, compared with 0.2% (2/928) on placebo. Syncope was reported in 1% (28/3265) of the patients treated with quetiapine fumarate tablet, compared with 0.2% (2/954) on placebo. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope may lead to falls.</p><p>Quetiapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia and treatment with antihypertensive medications). If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate.</p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.</p><h3>Increases in Blood Pressure (Children and Adolescents)</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet is supported by studies of quetiapine fumarate tablet in children and adolescent patients 10 to 17 years of age <span class="Italics">[see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.1 and 14.2)].</span></p><p>In a placebo-controlled quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet clinical trial (8 weeks duration) in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (≥20 mmHg) was 6.5% (6/92) for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet and 6.0% (6/100) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (≥10 mmHg) was 46.7% (43/92) for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet and 36.0% (36/100) for placebo.</p><p>In placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years old, 6-week duration) or bipolar mania (10 to 17 years old, 3-week duration), the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (≥20 mmHg) was 15.2% (51/335) for quetiapine fumarate tablet and 5.5% (9/163) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (≥10 mmHg) was 40.6% (136/335) for quetiapine fumarate tablet and 24.5% (40/163) for placebo. In the 26-week open-label clinical trial, one child with a reported history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment.</p><h3>Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine fumarate. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.</p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Agranulocytosis has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal cases and cases in patients without pre-existing risk factors. Neutropenia should be considered in patients presenting with infection, particularly in the absence of obvious predisposing factor(s), or in patients with unexplained fever, and should be managed as clinically appropriate.</span></p><p>Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors.</p><p>Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) should discontinue quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet and have their WBC followed until recovery.</p><h3>Cataracts</h3><p class="First">The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies [see <span class="Italics">NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.2)]</span>. Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children, and adolescents during long-term quetiapine treatment but a causal relationship to quetiapine use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment.</p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine <span class="Italics">[see OVERDOSAGE (10.1)]</span>, in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval.</p><p>The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).</p><p>Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.</p><p>Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g. cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure and heart hypertrophy).</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">During short-term clinical trials with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet, seizures occurred in 0.05% (1/1866) of patients treated with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet across all indications compared to 0.3% (3/928) on placebo. During clinical trials with quetiapine fumarate tablet, seizures occurred in 0.5% (20/3490) of patients treated with quetiapine fumarate tablet compared to 0.2% (2/954) on placebo. As with other antipsychotics, quetiapine fumarate should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.</p><h3>Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adults</span></span></p><p>Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T<span class="Sub">4</span>, irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patient's thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T<span class="Sub">4</span>, in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at follow-up.</p><p>In quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet clinical trials across all indications 1.8% (24/1336) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet versus 0.6% (3/530) on placebo experienced decreased free thyroxine (&lt;0.8 LLN) and 1.6% (21/1346) on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet versus 3.4% (18/534) on placebo experienced increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). About 0.7% (26/3489) of quetiapine fumarate tablet patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment.</p><p>In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were<span class="Sup">1</span>: decrease in free T<span class="Sub">4</span> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 2.0% (357/17513); decrease in total T<span class="Sub">4</span> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 4.0% (75/1861); decrease in free T<span class="Sub">3</span> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 0.4% (53/13766); decrease in total T<span class="Sub">3</span> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 2.0% (26/1312), and increase in TSH (&gt;5 mIU/L), 4.9% (956/19412).

Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.</p><p>Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro,</span> a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive <span class="Italics">[see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="First">Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3-day period of initial dose titration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 24.7% (235/951) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet compared to 10.3% (33/319) of placebo patients. In a bipolar depression clinical trial, somnolence was reported in 51.8% (71/137) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet compared to 12.9% (18/140) of placebo patients. In a clinical trial for bipolar mania, somnolence was reported in 50.3% (76/151) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet compared to 11.9% (19/160) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls.</p><p>In short-term adjunctive therapy trials for MDD, somnolence was reported in 40% (252/627) of patients on quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet respectively compared to 9% (27/309) of placebo patients. Somnolence was dose-related in these trials (37% (117/315) and 43% (135/312) for the 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively).</p><h3>Body Temperature Regulation</h3><p class="First">Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.</p><h3>Dysphagia</h3><p class="First">Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.</p><h3>Discontinuation Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine fumarate. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1993) for quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet and 6.7% (71/1065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness and irritability) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1 week post-discontinuation. Gradual dose reduction is advised.</p><h3>Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects</h3><p class="First">Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet is used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">OVERDOSAGE</span> <span class="Italics">(10.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">CLINICAL</span> <span class="Italics">PHARMACOLOGY</span> <span class="Italics">(12.1)]</span>.</p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Constipation was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with quetiapine and represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs.

In general, there was no indication of any different tolerability of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet in the elderly compared to younger adults. Nevertheless, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance, increase the pharmacodynamic response to quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period in the elderly.

While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of misuse or abuse of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Human Experience</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported events. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.12)]. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

However, the efficacy of quetiapine in these indications could be mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D<span class="Sub">2</span>) and serotonin type 2A (5HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>) antagonism. The active metabolite, N-desalkyl quetiapine (norquetiapine), has similar activity at D<span class="Sub">2</span>, but greater activity at 5HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors, than the parent drug (quetiapine).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Quetiapine and its metabolite norquetiapine have affinity for multiple neurotransmitter receptors with norquetiapine binding with higher affinity than quetiapine in general.

Steady-state mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of norquetiapine are about 21 to 27% and 46 to 56%, respectively of that observed for quetiapine. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism.

Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1-year toxicity study in rat; however, the results of these studies were not definitive. The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown.</p><p>Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum measurements in a 1-year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32- and 13-fold in male and female rats, respectively.

Doses were 10, 25, 50, 75, 150 and 250 mg/kg in rat studies which are approximately 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2 and 3-times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area, respectively.

Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be co-localized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown.</p><p>In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1 month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mg/kg, or 4 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a dose-related reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeat-dose dog and monkey studies; however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta 8 cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25% reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. Drug-related cataracts have not been seen in any other species; however, in a 1-year study in monkeys, a striated appearance of the anterior lens surface was detected in 2/7 females at a dose of 225 mg/kg or 5.5 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>body surface area.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Short-term Trials - Adults</span></span></p><p>The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet in the treatment of schizophrenia was demonstrated in 1 short-term, 6-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trial of inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia (n=573) who met DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia.

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score at week 8 (study 6 in Table 29).</p><p>The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate tablet for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder was established in 2 identical 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=1045). These studies included patients with either bipolar I or II disorder and those with or without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to quetiapine tablet were administered fixed doses of either 300 mg or 600 mg once daily.</p><p>The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in these studies was the MADRS. The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. In both studies, quetiapine fumarate tablet was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score at week 8 (Studies 7 and 8 in Table 28). In these studies, no additional benefit was seen with the 600 mg dose. For the 300 mg dose group, statistically significant improvements over placebo were seen in overall quality of life and satisfaction related to various areas of functioning, as measured using the Q-LES-Q(SF).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Treatment Group</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary Efficacy Measure: MADRS Total</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Number</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean Baseline Score (SD)</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">LS Mean Change from Baseline (SE)</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo-subtracted Difference<span class="Sup">2</span> (95% CI)</span><br/></p><p class="First">Study 6<br/></p><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet (300 mg/day)*<br/></p><p class="First">29.8(5.2)<br/></p><p class="First">-17.4(1.2)<br/></p><p class="First">-5.5(-7.9,-3.2)<br/></p><p class="First">Placebo<br/></p><p class="First">30.1(5.5)<br/></p><p class="First">-11.9(1.2)<br/></p><p class="First">--<br/></p><p class="First">Study 7<br/></p><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate tablet (300 mg/day) <span class="Sup">1</span><br/></p><p class="First">30.3(5.0)<br/></p><p class="First">-16.4(0.9)<br/></p><p class="First">-6.1(-8.3,-3.9)<br/></p><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate tablet (600 mg/day) <span class="Sup">1</span><br/></p><p class="First">30.3(5.3)<br/></p><p class="First">-16.7(0.9)<br/></p><p class="First">-6.5(-8.7,-4.3)<br/></p><p class="First">Study 8<br/></p><p class="First">Placebo<br/></p><p class="First">30.6(5.3)<br/></p><p class="First">-10.3(0.9)<br/></p><p class="First">--<br/></p><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate tablet (300 mg/day) <span class="Sup">1</span><br/></p><p class="First">31.1(5.7)<br/></p><p class="First">-16.9(1.0)<br/></p><p class="First">-5.0(-7.3,-2.7)<br/></p><p class="First">Quetiapine fumarate tablet (600 mg/day) <span class="Sup">1</span><br/></p><p class="First">29.9(5.6)<br/></p><p class="First">-16.0(1.0)<br/></p><p class="First">-4.1(-6.4,-1.8)<br/></p><p class="First">Placebo<br/></p><p class="First">29.6(5.4)<br/></p><p class="First">-11.9(1.0)<br/></p><p class="First">--<br/></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Divalproex</span></span></p><p>The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate tablet in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials in patients (n=1326) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder (studies 9 and 10). The trials included patients whose most recent episode was manic, depressed, or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the open-label phase, patients were required to be stable on quetiapine tablet plus lithium or divalproex for at least 12 weeks in order to be randomized. On average, patients were stabilized for 15 weeks. In the randomization phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or divalproex and were randomized to receive either quetiapine fumarate tablet (administered twice-daily totaling 400 mg/day to 800 mg/day) or placebo. Approximately 50% of the patients had discontinued from the quetiapine fumarate tablet group by day 280 and 50% of the placebo group had discontinued by day 117 of double-blind treatment. The primary endpoint in these studies was time to recurrence of a mood event (manic, mixed or depressed episode). A mood event was defined as medication initiation or hospitalization for a mood episode; YMRS score ≥ 20 or MADRS score ≥ 20 at 2 consecutive assessments; or study discontinuation due to a mood event.</p><p>In both studies, quetiapine fumarate tablet was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of any mood event (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The treatment effect was present for increasing time to recurrence of both manic and depressed episodes. The effect of quetiapine fumarate tablet was independent of any specific subgroup (assigned mood stabilizer, sex, age, race, most recent bipolar episode, or rapid cycling course).</p><h3>Major Depressive Disorder, Adjunctive Therapy to Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in the treatment of MDD was demonstrated in two 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials (n=936). Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet 150 mg/day or 300 mg/day was given as adjunctive therapy to existing antidepressant therapy in patients who had previously shown an inadequate response to at least one antidepressant. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet was administered as 50 mg/day on Days 1 and 2, and increased to 150 mg/day on Day 3 for both dose groups. On Day 5, the dose was increased to 300 mg/day in the 300 mg/day fixed-dose group. Inadequate response was defined as having continued depressive symptoms for the current episode [Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score of ≥ 20] despite using an antidepressant for 6 weeks at or above the minimally effective labelled dose. The mean HAM-D total score at entry was 24, and 17% of patients scored 28 or greater. Patients were on various antidepressants prior to study entry including SSRI's (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or citalopram), SNRI's, (duloxetine and venlafaxine,) TCA (amitriptyline) and other (bupropion).</p><p>The primary endpoint in these trials was change from baseline to week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS.), quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet 300 mg once daily as adjunctive treatment to other antidepressant therapy was superior to antidepressant alone in reduction of MADRS total score in both trials. Quetiapine fumarate extended-release tablet 150 mg once daily as adjunctive treatment was superior to antidepressant therapy alone in reduction of MADRS total score in one trial.
