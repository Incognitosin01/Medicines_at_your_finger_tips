Urea hydrates and is useful for conditions such as dry scalp.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Contraindicated in persons with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the listed ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">For external use only. Not for ophthalmic use. <span class="Bold">DO NOT USE ON BROKEN SKIN OR INFLAMED AREAS</span>.<br/>
If allergic reaction occurs, discontinue use. Avoid contact with eyes, genital areas and skin folds, as irritation and burning may result. If accidental contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water after application.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">This medication is to be used as directed by a physician. Do not use when inflammation or exudation is present as increased absorption may occur.</p><h2>Carcinogenesis</h2><p class="First">Dermal application of 25% and 50% solutions of 2.5% selenium sulfide lotion on mice over an 88-week period indicated no carcinogenic effects.</p><h2>Use in Pregnancy</h2><p class="First">Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Selenos™ Shampoo. It is also not known whether Selenos™ Shampoo can cause fetal harm when applied to the body surfaces of a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Under ordinary circumstances, Selenos™ Shampoo should not be used by pregnant women.</p><h2>Nursing Mothers</h2><p class="First">It is not known whether or not this drug is secreted in human milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Selenos™ Shampoo is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h2>Pediatric Use</h2><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In decreasing order of severity: skin irritation; occasional reports of increase in normal hair loss; discoloration of hair (can be avoided or minimized by thorough rinsing of hair after treatment). As with other shampoos, oiliness or dryness of hair and scalp may occur.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There are no documented reports of serious toxicity in humans resulting from acute ingestion of Selenos™ Shampoo.

Evacuation of the stomach contents should be considered in cases of acute oral ingestion.</p><h2>Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff:</span> Generally 2 applications each week for 2 weeks will usually control symptoms.
