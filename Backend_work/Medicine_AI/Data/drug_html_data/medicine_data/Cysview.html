Cysview is an optical imaging agent indicated for use in the cystoscopic detection of non-muscle-invasive papillary cancer of the bladder among patients suspected or known to have lesion(s) on the basis of a prior cystoscopy. Cysview is used with the Karl Storz D-Light C Photodynamic Diagnostic (PDD) system to perform cystoscopy with the blue light setting (Mode 2) as an adjunct to the white light setting (Mode 1).</p><h2>Highlights of Prescribing Information</h2><p>These highlights do not include all the information needed to use Cysview safely and effectively.
