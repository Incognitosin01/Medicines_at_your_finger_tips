A nose clip may be used if preferred.  The patient should exhale completely, followed by a controlled rapid deep inspiration from the device; hold breath for 5 seconds and exhale through the mouth.  Measure FEV<sub>1</sub> in duplicate 60 seconds after inhalation; repeat process until positive response or full dose (635 mg) has been administered. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Powder for inhalation: Store at &lt;25°C (&lt;77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).

Bronchial challenge testing with mannitol is for diagnostic purposes only. Bronchial challenge testing with mannitol should only be conducted by trained professionals under the supervision of a health care provider familiar with all aspects of the bronchial challenge test and the management of acute bronchospasm. Medications (eg, short-acting inhaled beta-agonists) and equipment to treat severe bronchospasm must be present in the testing area. If severe bronchospasm occurs, it should be treated immediately by administration of a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist. Because of the potential for severe bronchoconstriction, the bronchial challenge testing with mannitol should not be performed in any patient with clinically apparent asthma or very low baseline pulmonary function tests (eg, forced expiratory volume at 1 second [FEV1] less than 1 to 1.5 L or less than 70% of the predicted values).</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bronchospasm: <b>[US Boxed Warning] Use may result in severe bronchospasm; use only for bronchial challenge testing. Testing should only be done by trained professionals. Not for use in patients with asthma or very low baseline pulmonary function.  Medications (eg, short-acting inhaled beta-agonist) and equipment for the treatment of severe bronchospasm should be readily available. </b>Use with caution in patients with conditions that may increase sensitivity to bronchoconstriction (eg, severe cough, ventilatory impairment, spirometry-induced bronchoconstriction, hemoptysis of unknown origin, pneumothorax, recent abdominal, thoracic, or intraocular surgery, unstable angina, active upper or lower respiratory tract infection). Patients who have ≥10% reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> on administration of the 0 mg capsule, patients with a positive response to bronchial challenge testing, or patients who develop significant respiratory symptoms should receive short acting inhaled beta-agonist; monitor until full recovery to baseline.  Bronchial challenge testing should not be performed in children &lt;6 years of age as these patients are unable to provide reliable spirometric results. </p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Standard spirometry prior to bronchial challenge test; FEV<sub>1</sub> in duplicate 60 seconds after administration of each step of test</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
