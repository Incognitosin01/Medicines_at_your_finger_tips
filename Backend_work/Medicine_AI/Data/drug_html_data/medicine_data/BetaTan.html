It contains an antihistamine, a cough suppressant and a decongestant.</p><p>BetaTan is used to treat cough and nasal congestion associated with allergies or the common cold, including sinus congestion, pressure, runny nose, sneezing, and cough.</p><p>BetaTan may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide.</p><h2>Important infomation about BetaTan</h2><p>Carbetapentane is a cough suppressant.</p><p>Brompheniramine is an antihistamine. It blocks the effects of the naturally occurring chemical histamine in the body. Histamine can produce allergy symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.</p><p>Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages. Dilated blood vessels can cause nasal congestion (stuffy nose). Do not use BetaTan if you have used an MAO inhibitor such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) within the past 14 days. Serious, life-threatening side effects can occur if you take BetaTan before the MAO inhibitor has cleared from your body. BetaTan can cause side effects that may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be awake and alert. Avoid drinking alcohol. It can increase some of the side effects of BetaTan. Do not use any other over-the-counter cough, cold, or allergy medications without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Brompheniramine or phenylephrine are contained in many medicines available over the counter. If you take certain products together you may accidentally take too much of a certain drug. Read the label of any other medicine you are using to see if it contains brompheniramine, carbetapentane, or phenylephrine.</p><p>Avoid using other medicines that make you sleepy (such as cold medicine, pain medication, muscle relaxers, and medicine for seizures, depression or anxiety). They can add to sleepiness caused by brompheniramine, carbetapentane, and phenylephrine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Before taking BetaTan, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any drugs, or if you have:</p><ul>
