Your success will depend on your participation in all aspects of your smoking cessation program.</p><p>Use Nicorette exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor. Do not use in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Nicorette comes with patient instructions for safe and effective use.

<li>
<p>Chew the Nicorette gum slowly and stop chewing when your mouth starts to tingle. "Park" the gum between your cheek and gum and leave it there until the tingly feeling is gone. Then slowly chew a few more times until the tingling returns. Park the gum again in a different place in your mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove a piece of gum after 30 minutes, or when chewing no longer causes the tingly feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have very strong or frequent cravings, you may chew a new piece of gum within 60 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid chewing one piece of gum right after the other, or you may have side effects such as hiccups, heartburn, or nausea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For best results, use at least 9 pieces of gum per day for the first 6 weeks of treatment. Do not use more than 24 pieces of gum per day.</p>
