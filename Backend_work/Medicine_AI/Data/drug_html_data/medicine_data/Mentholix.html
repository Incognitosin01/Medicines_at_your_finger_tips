Lidocaine HCL 4%<br/>
Menthol 1%<br/>
INDICATIONS AND USAGE: For temporary relief of minor aches and pains of the muscles and joints associated with simple backache, arthritis, strains, bruises and sprains.<br/>
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Menthol instantly brings cool, soothing pain relief to aching muscles. Menthol also has a natural analgesic attribute when applied topically. It has molecules called ligands, which attach themselves to receptors (Kappa Opioid Receptors) in your cell, which produces a numbing effect. Using Menthol topically causes vasodilation, which increases blood flow to the affected area, allowing other medicinal ingredients found in the topical spray to work faster. Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.<br/>
CONTRAINDICATIONS: Mentholix is contraindicated in patients with known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, Menthol and to other components of Mentholix topical spray. Directions:<br/>
Adults and children 12 years and over apply directly to affected area. Do not use more than four times per day. Children under 12 years of age, consult a physician prior to use.<br/>
