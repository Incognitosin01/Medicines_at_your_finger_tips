It is used to treat gastric and duodenal ulcers, erosive esophagitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition where the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. Sometimes omeprazole is used in combination with antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat ulcers associated with the infection caused by the H. pylori bacteria.</p><p>Omeprazole is also used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition where the stomach produces too much acid.</p><p>Omeprazole is also used to treat dyspepsia, a condition that causes sour stomach, belching, heart burn, or indigestion.</p><p>In addition, omeprazole is used to prevent upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in seriously ill patients.</p><p>Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.</p><p>This medicine is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using First - Omeprazole</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
