It may not be specific to Eye Cool. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Do not use if the solution turns brown or becomes cloudy.</p><p>To use:</p><ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space.

<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the 2.5 or 10% eye drops:</p><ul>
<li>It is very important that you use this medicine only as directed. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of too much medicine being absorbed into the body and the chance of side effects.
