Foals should be treated initially at 6 to 8 weeks of age, and routine treatment repeated as appropriate. Consult your veterinarian for a control program to meet your specific needs. Equell Paste effectively controls gastrointestinal nematodes and bots of horses. Regular treatment will reduce the chances of verminous arteritis caused by <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris.</span></p><h3>Product Advantages</h3><p class="First">Equell Paste kills important internal parasites, including bots and the arterial stages of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span>, with a single dose. Equell Paste is a potent antiparasitic agent that is neither a benzimidazole nor an organophosphate.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY</h2><p class="First">Equell Paste may be used in horses of all ages, including mares at any stage of pregnancy.

Healing of summer sores involving extensive tissue changes may require other appropriate therapy in conjunction with treatment with Equell Paste. Reinfection, and measures for its prevention, should also be considered.
