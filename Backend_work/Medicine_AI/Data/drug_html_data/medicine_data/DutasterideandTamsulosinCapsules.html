</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Dutasteride and Tamsulosin Capsules</h2><h3>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Treatment</h3><p class="First">Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic BPH in men with an enlarged prostate.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">Dutasteride-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, are not approved for the prevention of prostate cancer.</p><h2>Dutasteride and Tamsulosin Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended dosage of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules is 1 capsule (0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride) taken once daily approximately 30 minutes after the same meal each day.</p><p>The capsules should be swallowed whole and not chewed or opened. Contact with the contents of the dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule may result in irritation of the oropharyngeal mucosa.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride Capsules, containing 0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride, hard shell, with an opaque yellow cap printed '640' with black ink and opaque white body.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated for use in:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  Pregnancy. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, dutasteride inhibited development of male fetus external genitalia. Therefore, dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span> .</li>
<li>  Women of childbearing potential <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span> .</li>
<li>  Pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span> .</li>
<li>  Patients with previously demonstrated, clinically significant hypersensitivity (e.g. serious skin reactions, angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, respiratory symptoms) to dutasteride, other 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, tamsulosin, or any other component of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules<span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="First">As with other alpha adrenergic antagonists, orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) may occur in patients treated with tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, and can result in syncope. Patients starting treatment with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations where syncope could result in an injury <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Drug-Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4</span></span></p><p>Tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should not be coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) as this can significantly increase tamsulosin exposure <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4, Inhibitors of CYP2D6, or a Combination of Both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 Inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should be used with caution when coadministered with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. erythromycin), strong (e.g. paroxetine) or moderate (e.g. terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors, or in patients known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, as there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cimetidine</span></span></p><p>Caution is advised when tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, are coadministered with cimetidine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Other Alpha Adrenergic Antagonists</span></span></p><p>Tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should not be coadministered with other alpha adrenergic antagonists because of the increased risk of symptomatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic antagonist-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, are coadministered with PDE-5 inhibitors. Alpha adrenergic antagonists and PDE-5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these 2 drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Warfarin</span></span></p><p>Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Effects on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of dutasteride with tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as with dutasteride monotherapy.</p><p>In clinical trials, dutasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6 months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. Dutasteride containing treatment, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, a new baseline PSA should be established at least 3 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on a dutasteride-containing treatment, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules may also affect PSA test results.</p><p>To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, for 3 months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men.</p><p>The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of dutasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. </p><h3>Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer</h3><p class="First">In men aged 50 to 75 years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2.5 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL taking dutasteride in the 4-year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo (dutasteride 1% versus placebo 0.5%) <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR<span class="Sup">Â®</span>), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%).  5 alpha-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume or trial-related factors impacted the results of these trials has not been established.</p><h3>Evaluation for Other Urological Diseases</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating treatment with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, BPH and prostate cancer may coexist.</p><h3>Exposure of WomenâRisk to Male Fetus</h3><p class="First">Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be handled by a woman who is pregnant or who could become pregnant. Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin and could result in unintended fetal exposure. If a woman who is pregnant or could become pregnant comes in contact with a leaking capsule, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Priapism</h3><p class="First">Priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity) has been associated (probably less than 1 in 50,000) with the use of alpha-adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients should be advised about the seriousness of the condition.</p><h3>Blood Donation</h3><p class="First">Men being treated with a dutasteride-containing product, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of dutasteride to a pregnant female transfusion recipient.</p><h3>Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha adrenergic antagonists, including tamsulosin, which is a component of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.</p><p>Most reports were in patients taking the alpha -adrenergic antagonist when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patients had been off the alpha-adrenergic antagonist for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances.</p><p>IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha-adrenergic antagonist therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended.</p><h3>Sulfa Allergy</h3><p class="First">In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin-containing products, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride.</p><h3>Effect on Semen Characteristics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dutasteride:</span></span> The effects of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in normal volunteers aged 18 to 52 (n = 27 dutasteride, n = 23 placebo) throughout 52 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. At 52 weeks, the mean percent reductions from baseline in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility were 23%, 26%, and 18%, respectively, in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected. After 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean percent change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23% lower than baseline. While mean values for all semen parameters at all time-points remained within the normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change (30%), 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of greater than 90% from baseline at 52 weeks, with partial recovery at the 24-week follow-up. The clinical significance of dutasteride's effect on semen characteristics for an individual patient's fertility is not known.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tamsulosin:</span></span> The effects of tamsulosin hydrochloride on sperm counts or sperm function have not been evaluated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">The clinical efficacy and safety of coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin, which are individual components of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, have been evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial (the Combination with Alpha-Blocker Therapy, or CombAT, trial). Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), ejaculation disorders, and dizziness. Ejaculation disorders occurred significantly more in subjects receiving coadministration therapy (11%) compared with those receiving dutasteride (2%) or tamsulosin (4%) as monotherapy.</li>
<li>Trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 6% of subjects receiving coadministered dutasteride and tamsulosin and in 4% of subjects receiving dutasteride or tamsulosin as monotherapy. The most common adverse reaction in all treatment arms leading to trial withdrawal was erectile dysfunction (1% to 1.5%).</li>
</ul><p>In the CombAT trial, over 4,800 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg dutasteride, 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride, or coadministration therapy (0.5 mg dutasteride and 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride) administered once daily in a 4-year double-blind trial. Overall, 1,623 subjects received monotherapy with dutasteride; 1,611 subjects received monotherapy with tamsulosin; and 1,610 subjects received coadministration therapy. The population was aged 49 to 88 years (mean age: 66 years) and 88% were white.

Composite cardiac failure was also examined in a separate 4-year placebo-controlled trial evaluating dutasteride in men at risk for development of prostate cancer. The incidence of cardiac failure in subjects taking dutasteride was 0.6% (26/4,105) compared with 0.4% (15/4,126) in subjects on placebo. A majority of subjects with cardiac failure in both trials had comorbidities associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure. Therefore, the clinical significance of the numerical imbalances in cardiac failure is unknown. No causal relationship between dutasteride alone or coadministered with tamsulosin and cardiac failure has been established. No imbalance was observed in the incidence of overall cardiovascular adverse events in either trial.</p><p>Additional information regarding adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials with dutasteride or tamsulosin monotherapy follows:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dutasteride</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Long-term Treatment (Up to 4 Years): High-grade Prostate Cancer:</span></p><p>The REDUCE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 8,231 men aged 50 to 75 years with a serum PSA of 2.5 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL and a negative prostate biopsy within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n = 4,126) or 0.5 mg daily doses of dutasteride (n = 4,105) for up to 4 years. The mean age was 63 years and 91% were white. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4 years of treatment or had "for-cause biopsies" at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated. There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer in men receiving dutasteride (1%) compared with men on placebo (0.5%) <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span> In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5 mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%).</p><p>No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with dutasteride.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reproductive and Breast Disorders</span></span></p><p>In the 3 pivotal placebo-controlled BPH trials with dutasteride, each 4 years in duration, there was no evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions (impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder) or breast disorders with increased duration of treatment. Among these 3 trials, there was 1 case of breast cancer in the dutasteride group and 1 case in the placebo group. No cases of breast cancer were reported in any treatment group in the 4-year CombAT trial or the 4-year REDUCE trial.</p><p>The relationship between long-term use of dutasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tamsulosin</span>: According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in two 13-week treatment trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride and at an incidence higher than in subjects receiving placebo were: infection, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, somnolence, insomnia, rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough increased, sinusitis, and diarrhea.</p><p><span class="Italics">Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis</span></p><p>According to the tamsulosin prescribing information, in clinical trials with tamsulosin monotherapy, a positive orthostatic test result was observed in 16% (81/502) of subjects receiving 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride versus 11% (54/493) of subjects receiving placebo. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in the tamsulosin-treated subjects than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The following sections reflect information available for the individual components.</p><h3>Cytochrome P450 Inhibition</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dutasteride:</span></span> Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors on dutasteride has not been studied. Because of the potential for drug-drug interactions, use caution when prescribing a dutasteride-containing product, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules, to patients taking potent, chronic CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. </p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tamsulosin:</span></span> <span class="Italics">Strong and Moderate Inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6:</span> Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6.</p><p>Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increases in the Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of tamsulosin by factors of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively.

A similar increase in exposure is expected in poor metabolizers (PM) of CYP2D6 as compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole). The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cimetidine:</span> Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dutasteride:</span></span> Concomitant administration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 3 weeks with warfarin does not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of the S- or R-warfarin isomers or alter the effect of warfarin on prothrombin time <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tamsulosin:</span></span> A definitive drug-drug interaction trial between tamsulosin hydrochloride and warfarin was not conducted.

Dutasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, dutasteride inhibited normal development of external genitalia in male fetuses. Therefore, dutasteride may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If dutasteride is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking dutasteride, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p>Abnormalities in the genitalia of male fetuses is an expected physiological consequence of inhibition of the conversion of testosterone to DHT by 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. These results are similar to observations in male infants with genetic 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin. To avoid potential fetal exposure, women who are pregnant or could become pregnant should not handle dutasteride-containing capsules, including dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. If contact is made with leaking capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span> Dutasteride is secreted into semen. The highest measured semen concentration of dutasteride in treated men was 14 ng/mL. Assuming exposure of a 50 kg woman to 5 mL of semen and 100% absorption, the woman's dutasteride concentration would be about 0.0175 ng/mL. This concentration is more than 100 times less than concentrations producing abnormalities of male genitalia in animal studies. Dutasteride is highly protein bound in human semen (greater than 96%), which may reduce the amount of dutasteride available for vaginal absorption.</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in female rats, oral administration of dutasteride at doses 10 times less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.5 mg daily resulted in abnormalities of male genitalia in the fetus (decreased anogenital distance at 0.05 mg/kg/day), nipple development, hypospadias, and distended preputial glands in male offspring (at all doses of 0.05, 2.5, 12.5, and 30 mg/kg/day). An increase in stillborn pups was observed at 111 times the MRHD, and reduced fetal body weight was observed at doses of about 15 times the MRHD (animal dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day). Increased incidences of skeletal variations considered to be delays in ossification associated with reduced body weight were observed at doses at about 56 times the MRHD (animal dose of 12.5 mg/kg/day).</p><p>In a rabbit embryo-fetal study, doses 28- to 93-fold the MRHD (animal doses of 30, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day) were administered orally during the period of major organogenesis (gestation days 7 to 29) to encompass the late period of external genitalia development. Histological evaluation of the genital papilla of fetuses revealed evidence of feminization of the male fetus at all doses. A second embryo-fetal study in rabbits at 0.3- to 53-fold the expected clinical exposure (animal doses of 0.05, 0.4, 3, and 30 mg/kg/day) also produced evidence of feminization of the genitalia in male fetuses at all doses.</p><p>In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, dutasteride doses of 0.05, 2.5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg/day were administered. Unequivocal evidence of feminization of the genitalia (i.e., decreased anogenital distance, increased incidence of hypospadias, nipple development) of male offspring occurred at 14- to 90-fold the MRHD (animal doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day or greater). At 0.05-fold the expected clinical exposure (animal dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day), evidence of feminization was limited to a small, but statistically significant, decrease in anogenital distance. Animal doses of 2.5 to 30 mg/kg/day resulted in prolonged gestation in the parental females and a decrease in time to vaginal patency for female offspring and a decrease in prostate and seminal vesicle weights in male offspring. Effects on newborn startle response were noted at doses greater than or equal to 12.5 mg/kg/day. Increased stillbirths were noted at 30 mg/kg/day.</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rhesus monkeys were exposed intravenously to a dutasteride blood level comparable to the dutasteride concentration found in human semen. Dutasteride was administered on gestation days 20 to 100 at doses of 400, 780, 1,325, or 2,010 ng/day (12 monkeys/group). The development of male external genitalia of monkey offspring was not adversely affected. Reduction of fetal adrenal weights, reduction in fetal prostate weights, and increases in fetal ovarian and testis weights were observed at the highest dose tested in monkeys. Based on the highest measured semen concentration of dutasteride in treated men (14 ng/mL), these doses represent 0.8 to 16 times the potential maximum exposure of a 50 kg human female to 5 mL semen daily from a dutasteride-treated man, assuming 100% absorption. (These calculations are based on blood levels of parent drug which are achieved at 32 to 186 times the daily doses administered to pregnant monkeys on a ng/kg basis). Dutasteride is highly bound to proteins in human semen (greater than 96%), potentially reducing the amount of dutasteride available for vaginal absorption.

DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase, which exists as 2 isoforms, type 1 and type 2. The type 2 isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues, while the type 1 isoenzyme is also responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver.</p><p>Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under <span class="Italics">in</span> <span class="Italics">vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Tamsulosin:</span></span> Smooth muscle tone is mediated by the sympathetic nervous stimulation of alpha1-adrenoceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and a reduction in symptoms of BPH.</p><p>Tamsulosin, an alpha1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, exhibits selectivity for alpha1-receptors in the human prostate. At least 3 discrete alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes have been identified: alpha1A, alpha1B, and alpha1D; their distribution differs between human organs and tissue. Approximately 70% of the alpha1-receptors in human prostate are of the alpha1A subtype. Tamsulosin is not intended for use as an antihypertensive.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dutasteride</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Effect on 5 Alpha-Dihydrotestosterone and Testosterone</span></p><p>The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction of DHT is dose-dependent and is observed within 1 to 2 weeks. After 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively. In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 4 years, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1 year, 93% at 2 years, and 95% at both 3 and 4 years. The median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years, 26% at 3 years, and 22% at 4 years, but the mean and median levels remained within the physiologic range.</p><p>In patients with BPH treated with 5 mg/day of dutasteride or placebo for up to 12 weeks prior to transurethral resection of the prostate, mean DHT concentrations in prostatic tissue were significantly lower in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (784 and 5,793 pg/g, respectively, <span class="Italics">P</span> &lt;0.001).

Statistically significant, baseline-adjusted mean increases compared with placebo were observed for total testosterone at 8 weeks (97.1 ng/dL, <span class="Italics">P</span> &lt;0.003) and thyroid-stimulating hormone at 52 weeks (0.4 mcIU/mL, <span class="Italics">P</span> &lt;0.05). The median percentage changes from baseline within the dutasteride group were 17.9% for testosterone at 8 weeks and 12.4% for thyroid-stimulating hormone at 52 weeks. After stopping dutasteride for 24 weeks, the mean levels of testosterone and thyroid-stimulating hormone had returned to baseline in the group of subjects with available data at the visit. In subjects with BPH treated with dutasteride in a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, there was a median percent increase in luteinizing hormone of 12% at 6 months and 19% at both 12 and 24 months.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Effects</span></p><p>Plasma lipid panel and bone mineral density were evaluated following 52 weeks of dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily in healthy volunteers. There was no change in bone mineral density as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry compared with either placebo or baseline. In addition, the plasma lipid profile (i.e. total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins, and triglycerides) was unaffected by dutasteride.

Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole resulted in increases in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of tamsulosin by factors of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively. The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g. erythromycin) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated.</p><p>The effects of paroxetine (a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6) at 20 mg once daily for 9 days on the pharmacokinetics of a single tamsulosin capsule 0.4-mg dose was investigated in 24 healthy volunteers (age range: 23 to 47 years). Concomitant treatment with paroxetine resulted in increases in the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of tamsulosin by factors of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively. A similar increase in exposure is expected in poor metabolizers (PM) of CYP2D6 as compared with extensive metabolizers (EM). A fraction of the population (about 7% of whites and 2% of African-Americans) are CYP2D6 PMs. Since CYP2D6 PMs cannot be readily identified and the potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure exists when tamsulosin 0.4-mg is coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2D6 PMs, tamsulosin 0.4 mg capsules should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole).</p><p>The effects of concomitant administration of a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. terbinafine) on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin have not been evaluated.</p><p>The effects of coadministration of both a CYP3A4 and a CYP2D6 inhibitor with tamsulosin capsules have not been evaluated. However, there is a potential for significant increase in tamsulosin exposure when tamsulosin 0.4 mg is coadministered with a combination of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cimetidine:</span> The effects of cimetidine at the highest recommended dose (400 mg every 6 hours for 6 days) on the pharmacokinetics of a single tamsulosin capsule 0.4-mg dose was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers (age range: 21 to 38 years). Treatment with cimetidine resulted in a significant decrease (26%) in the clearance of tamsulosin hydrochloride, which resulted in a moderate increase in tamsulosin hydrochloride AUC (44%).</p><p><span class="Italics">Alpha adrenergic Antagonists: Dutasteride:</span> In a single-sequence, crossover trial in healthy volunteers, the administration of tamsulosin or terazosin in combination with dutasteride had no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either alpha-adrenergic antagonist.

Therefore, caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nifedipine, Atenolol, Enalapril: Tamsulosin:</span> In 3 trials in hypertensive subjects (age range: 47 to 79 years) whose blood pressure was controlled with stable doses of nifedipine extended-release, atenolol, or enalapril for at least 3 months, tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg for 7 days followed by tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg  for another 7 days (n = 8 per trial) resulted in no clinically significant effects on blood pressure and pulse rate compared with placebo (n = 4 per trial). Therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary when tamsulosin is administered concomitantly with nifedipine extended-release, atenolol, or enalapril.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digoxin and Theophylline: Dutasteride:</span> In a trial of 20 healthy volunteers, dutasteride did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin when administered concomitantly at a dose of 0.5 mg/day for 3 weeks.</p><p><span class="Italics">Tamsulosin:</span> In 2 trials in healthy volunteers (n = 10 per trial; age range: 19 to 39 years) receiving tamsulosin capsules 0.4 mg/day for 2 days, followed by tamsulosin capsules 0.8 mg/day for 5 to 8 days, single intravenous doses of digoxin 0.5 mg or theophylline 5 mg/kg resulted in no change in the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or theophylline. Therefore, dosage adjustments are not necessary when a tamsulosin capsule is administered concomitantly with digoxin or theophylline.</p><p><span class="Italics">Furosemide: Tamsulosin:</span> The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg/day (steady-state) and furosemide 20 mg intravenously (single dose) was evaluated in 10 healthy volunteers (age range: 21 to 40 years). Tamsulosin had no effect on the pharmacodynamics (excretion of electrolytes) of furosemide. While furosemide produced an 11% to 12% reduction in tamsulosin C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC, these changes are expected to be clinically insignificant and do not require dose adjustment for tamsulosin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Calcium Channel Antagonists: Dutasteride:</span> In a population pharmacokinetics analysis, a decrease in clearance of dutasteride was noted when coadministered with the CYP3A4 inhibitors verapamil (-37%, n = 6) and diltiazem (-44%, n = 5). In contrast, no decrease in clearance was seen when amlodipine, another calcium channel antagonist that is not a CYP3A4 inhibitor, was coadministered with dutasteride (+7%, n = 4). The decrease in clearance and subsequent increase in exposure to dutasteride in the presence of verapamil and diltiazem is not considered to be clinically significant. No dosage adjustment is recommended.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cholestyramine: Dutasteride:</span> Administration of a single 5 mg dose of dutasteride followed 1 hour later by 12 g cholestyramine did not affect the relative bioavailability of dutasteride in 12 normal volunteers.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No non-clinical studies have been conducted with dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.

Two of the 3 major human metabolites have been detected in mice. The exposure to these metabolites in mice is either lower than in humans or is not known.</p><p>In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Han Wistar rats, at doses of 1.5, 7.5, and 53 mg/kg/day in males and 0.8, 6.3, and 15 mg/kg/day in females, there was an increase in Leydig cell adenomas in the testes at 135-fold the MRHD (53 mg/kg/day and greater). An increased incidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia was present at 52-fold the MRHD (male rat doses of 7.5 mg/kg/day and greater). A positive correlation between proliferative changes in the Leydig cells and an increase in circulating luteinizing hormone levels has been demonstrated with 5- alpha-reductase inhibitors and is consistent with an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis following 5-alpha-reductase inhibition. At tumorigenic doses, luteinizing hormone levels in rats were increased by 167%. In this study, the major human metabolites were tested for carcinogenicity at approximately 1 to 3 times the expected clinical exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Tamsulosin:</span> In a rat carcinogenicity assay, no increases in tumor incidence was observed in rats administered up to 3 times the MRHD of 0.8 mg/day (based on AUC of animal doses up to 43 mg/kg/day in males and up to 52 mg/kg/day in females), with the exception of a modest increase in the frequency of mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats receiving doses of 5.4 mg/kg or greater.</p><p>In a carcinogenicity assay, mice were administered up to 8 times the MRHD of tamsulosin (oral doses up to 127 mg/kg/day in males and 158 mg/kg/day in females).

The fertility effects were reversed by recovery week 6 at all doses, and sperm counts were normal at the end of a 14-week recovery period. The 5-alpha-reductaseârelated changes consisted of cytoplasmic vacuolation of tubular epithelium in the epididymides and decreased cytoplasmic content of epithelium, consistent with decreased secretory activity in the prostate and seminal vesicles. The microscopic changes were no longer present at recovery week 14 in the low-dose group and were partly recovered in the remaining treatment groups. Low levels of dutasteride (0.6 to 17 ng/mL) were detected in the serum of untreated female rats mated to males dosed at 10, 50, or 500 mg/kg/day for 29 to 30 weeks.</p><p>In a fertility study in female rats, oral administration of dutasteride at doses of 0.05, 2.5, 12.5, and 30 mg/kg/day resulted in reduced litter size, increased embryo resorption and feminization of male fetuses (decreased anogenital distance) at 2- to 10-fold the MRHD (animal doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day or greater).

The mechanism of decreased fertility in male rats is considered to be an effect of the compound on the vaginal plug formation possibly due to changes of semen content or impairment of ejaculation. The effects on fertility were reversible showing improvement by 3 days after a single dose and 4 weeks after multiple dosing. Effects on fertility in males were completely reversed within nine weeks of discontinuation of multiple dosing. Multiple doses of 0.2 and 16 times the MRHD (animal doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg/day tamsulosin hydrochloride) did not significantly alter fertility in male rats.
