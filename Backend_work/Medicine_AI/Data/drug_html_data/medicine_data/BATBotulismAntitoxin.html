Patients who have had previous therapy with an equine-derived antivenom/antitoxin, with a history of hypersensitivity to horses, asthma, or hay fever are at a greater risk for developing severe hypersensitivity reactions to BAT. Administer BAT in a setting with appropriate equipment, medication including epinephrine, and personnel trained in the management of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and shock.</p><p>Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of acute allergic reaction (e.g. urticaria, pruritus, erythema, angioedema, bronchospasm with wheezing or cough, stridor, laryngeal edema, hypotension, tachycardia) during and following the BAT infusion. In case of hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue BAT administration immediately and administer appropriate emergency care. Have immediately available medications such as epinephrine for emergency treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>For patients at risk for hypersensitivity reaction, begin BAT administration at the lowest rate achievable (&lt; 0.01 mL/min) and monitor.</p><h3>Delayed Allergic Reactions (Serum Sickness)</h3><p class="First">Delayed allergic reactions (serum sickness e.g. fever, urticarial or maculopapular rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy) may occur following BAT administration, typically 10-21 days after infusion. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of delayed allergic reaction.</p><p>If a delayed allergic reaction (serum sickness) is suspected, administer appropriate medical care.</p><h3>Infusion Reactions</h3><p class="First">Chills, fever, headaches, nausea, and vomiting can be related to the rate of infusion. Arthralgia, myalgia and fatigue or vasovagal reactions may also develop. Carefully observe patients for the onset of these infusion reactions throughout the infusion period and immediately following an infusion.</p><p>Reduce the rate of infusion if the patient experiences infusion reactions and administer symptomatic therapy. If symptoms worsen, discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical care.</p><h3>Interference with Blood Glucose Testing</h3><p class="First">The maltose contained in BAT can interfere with some types of blood glucose monitoring systems i.e. those based on glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline-quinone (GDH-PQQ) method. This can result in falsely elevated glucose readings and inappropriate administration of insulin, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia. Cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated results <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7 DRUG INTERACTIONS)]</span>.</p><h3>Transmissible Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because BAT is made from equine plasma, it may carry the risk of transmitting infectious agents e.g. viruses. The equine plasma pools are screened for the presence of certain infectious agents and the manufacturing process for BAT includes measures to inactivate and remove certain viruses <span class="Italics">[see Description (11 DESCRIPTION)]</span>. Despite these measures, such products can still potentially transmit disease. No cases of transmission of viral diseases have been associated with the use of BAT.</p><p>Report all infections thought by a physician to have been transmitted by BAT to Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc. at 1-800-768-2304. Discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient or their legal guardian before administering it to the patient <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (</span>17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION)<span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most common adverse reactions observed in ≥ 5 % of healthy volunteers in clinical trials were headache, nausea, pruritus, and urticaria.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥ 1% of patients in a clinical study were pyrexia, rash, chills, nausea and edema.</p><p>The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</span></p><p>In a randomized, double-blind, parallel arm trial conducted to evaluate the safety of BAT in healthy subjects, and to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of the seven botulinum antitoxin serotypes contained in BAT following intravenous (IV) administration, 40 subjects were randomized to receive either one (n=20) or two vials (n=20) of BAT.</p><p>In a second parallel arm, randomized, double-blind pharmacodynamic trial, 26 healthy subjects were randomized to receive either BAT in saline (n=16) or placebo (0.9% saline; n=10).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions in all healthy subjects were headache (9%), pruritus (5%), nausea (5%), and urticaria (5%). Other adverse reactions reported in less than 4% of subjects included pyrexia and throat discomfort. All reported adverse reactions were considered mild or moderate. No serious adverse reactions were reported. Two moderate acute allergic reactions that required premature termination of the infusion and treatment were reported. Reactions were predefined as mild if the subject was aware but could tolerate. Moderate reactions were predefined as discomfort enough to interfere with normal daily activity.</p><p>A total of 231 subjects with suspected or confirmed botulism were exposed to BAT in an open-label observational expanded access clinical study sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>The majority of adult (213/216) and pediatric (13/15) subjects received one dose of BAT. Three adult subjects were exposed to a second dose of BAT, and two pediatric subjects each received two infant doses (10% of the adult dose). The administration of a second dose varied from seven hours to one month after the first dose.</p><p>Safety data was actively collected from treating physicians by the CDC. However, no on-site safety monitoring was performed, and the CDC relied on follow-up information provided by the treating physicians to determine the reporting frequencies for adverse reactions. Of the 231 subjects receiving BAT, safety information was available for 228 subjects. Adverse reactions were reported in 10% of all subjects. The most common adverse reactions were pyrexia (4%), rash (2%), chills (1%), nausea (1%), and edema (1%). Other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects. No subject experienced anaphylaxis. One subject experienced a serious adverse reaction of hemodynamic instability characterized by bradycardia, tachycardia, and asystole during BAT administration. One subject experienced mild serum sickness (&lt; 1%) with myalgia, arthralgia, and dark urine twelve days after BAT administration.</p><p class="First">ALL BODY SYSTEM</p><p class="First">OVERALL</p><p class="First">37</p><p class="First">23</p><p class="First">10.1</p><p class="First">Cardiac disorders</p><p class="First">Cardiac arrest</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Bradycardia</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Tachycardia</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Gastrointestinal disorders</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">General disorders and administration site conditions</p><p class="First">Pyrexia</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">3.9</p><p class="First">Chest discomfort</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Edema</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">2</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">Chills</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">Feeling jittery</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Immune system disorders</p><p class="First">Serum Sickness</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Investigations</p><p class="First">Blood pressure increased</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">White blood cell count increased</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Psychiatric disorders</p><p class="First">Agitation</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Anxiety</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Renal and urinary disorders</p><p class="First">Urinary retention</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders</p><p class="First">Bronchospasm</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</p><p class="First">Erythema</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Hyperhidrosis</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Rash</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">Vascular disorders</p><p class="First">Hemodynamic instability</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">Hypotension</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">1</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">All adverse reactions were classified according to MedDRA Version 15.0 and are ranked according to medical significance within a given SOC.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following hypersensitivity/allergic reactions have been reported in patients treated with BAT:</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. All subjects from the two clinical trials were tested for immunogenicity against BAT at baseline and at the end of the studies (Day 28) using a validated assay. Eleven subjects seroconverted during the course of the two trials. One subject from each clinical trial experienced a moderate allergic reaction during the administration of BAT. Both subjects were negative for anti-BAT antibodies at baseline and at the end of their respective studies. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to BAT with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drug Laboratory Interactions: Blood Glucose Testing</h3><p class="First">BAT contains maltose which can interfere with certain types of blood glucose monitoring systems <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.4 Interference with Blood Glucose Testing)<span class="Italics">].</span> Only test systems that are glucose-specific should be used in patients receiving BAT. This interference can result in falsely elevated glucose readings that can lead to untreated hypoglycemia or to inappropriate insulin administration, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia.</p><p>The product information of the blood glucose testing system, including that of the test strips, should be carefully reviewed to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral systems. If any uncertainty exists, contact the manufacturer of the testing system to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Emphasis">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no human or animal data to establish the presence or absence of BAT associated risk.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Emphasis">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data to assess the presence or absence of BAT in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production/excretion.</p><p>Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother’s clinical need for BAT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BAT or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The effectiveness of BAT has not been established in pediatric patients. Limited pediatric safety data are available.</p><p>Fifteen pediatric subjects (age 10 days to 17 years; including 1 newborn, 3 infants and toddlers, 4 children and 7 adolescents) received BAT under the CDC expanded access clinical study. A 3-year old subject and an infant received two infant doses, and 13 pediatric subjects received one pediatric dose according to Salisbury Rule [Table 2].</p><p>Two adverse reactions were reported in two pediatric subjects. One subject experienced an adverse reaction of pyrexia following infusion of BAT, while the other subject experienced a serious adverse reaction of hemodynamic instability characterized by tachycardia, bradycardia, and asystole during infusion of BAT.</p><p>Dosing in pediatric patients is based on Salisbury Rule.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety, pharmacokinetics, and effectiveness of BAT have not been established in geriatric subjects.</p><p>Thirty six geriatric subjects received BAT under the CDC expanded access clinical study. One geriatric subject experienced rash as an adverse reaction following infusion of BAT.</p><h2>BAT Botulism Antitoxin Description</h2><p class="First">BAT [Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) – (Equine)] is a sterile solution of F(ab’)<span class="Sub">2</span> and F(ab') <span class="Sub">2</span>-related antibody fragments prepared from plasma obtained from horses that have been immunized with a specific serotype of botulinum toxoid and toxin. To obtain the final heptavalent product, the seven antitoxin serotypes are blended. BAT is supplied in either a 20 or 50 milliliter vial size, with a fill volume ranging from 10 to 22 milliliters per vial. BAT is administered intravenously.</p><p>The manufacturing process for each antitoxin type includes cation-exchange chromatography to purify the immune globulin fraction, digestion with pepsin to produce F(ab')<span class="Sub">2</span> plus F(ab') <span class="Sub">2</span>-related immune globulin fragments, anion exchange chromatography to remove the pepsin as well as other impurities and filtration. In addition, the manufacturing process includes two viral inactivation/removal steps; solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment and virus filtration [Table 4].</p><p>The S/D treatment step is effective at inactivating known lipid-enveloped viruses such as equine encephalitis, equine arteritis, West Nile virus, equine infectious anemia, equine herpes virus, rabies, and equine influenza. The BAT manufacturing process also includes a robust filtration step that is effective in reducing the levels of some lipid-enveloped viruses (listed above) as well as non-enveloped viruses including equine rhinovirus, equine adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and equine parvovirus.</p><p class="First">Genome</p><p class="First">RNA</p><p class="First">RNA</p><p class="First">RNA</p><p class="First">DNA</p><p class="First">RNA</p><p class="First">DNA</p><p class="First">DNA</p><p class="First">RNA</p><p class="First">Virus</p><p class="First">XMuLV</p><p class="First">WNV</p><p class="First">BVDV</p><p class="First">PRV</p><p class="First">PI3</p><p class="First">Ad2</p><p class="First">Porcine Parvovirus</p><p class="First">EMC</p><p class="First">Family</p><p class="First">Retro</p><p class="First">Flavi</p><p class="First">Flavi</p><p class="First">Herpes</p><p class="First">Paramyxo</p><p class="First">Adeno</p><p class="First">Parvo</p><p class="First">Picorna</p><p class="First">Size (nm)</p><p class="First">80-110</p><p class="First">40-70</p><p class="First">50-70</p><p class="First">150-200</p><p class="First">100-200</p><p class="First">70-90</p><p class="First">18-24</p><p class="First">25-30</p><p class="First">Nanofiltration (log<span class="Sub">10</span>)</p><p class="First">≥ 2.7</p><p class="First">≥ 2.1</p><p class="First">≥ 4.5</p><p class="First">n.t.</p><p class="First">n.t.</p><p class="First">≥ 4.7</p><p class="First">4.5</p><p class="First">≥ 4.5</p><p class="First">S/D (log<span class="Sub">10</span>)</p><p class="First">≥ 4.3</p><p class="First">≥ 5.1</p><p class="First">n.t.</p><p class="First">≥ 5.1</p><p class="First">≥ 5.5</p><p class="First">n.t.</p><p class="First">n.t.</p><p class="First">n.t.</p><p class="First">Total Reduction (log<span class="Sub">10</span>)</p><p class="First">≥ 7.0</p><p class="First">≥ 7.2</p><p class="First">≥ 4.5</p><p class="First">≥ 5.1</p><p class="First">≥ 5.5</p><p class="First">≥ 4.7</p><p class="First">4.5</p><p class="First">≥ 4.5</p><p class="First">XMuLV: Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus; specific model for equine infectious anemia, and a model for lipid-enveloped RNA viruses of similar size, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdo family).</p><p>WNV: West Nile Virus; relevant virus, and specific model for lipid-enveloped RNA viruses, including the arboviruses, which contains both Flavividae and Togaviridae and includes equine encephalitis viruses (Toga family) and equine viral arteritis (Arteri family, formerly a Toga virus).</p><p>BVDV: Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus; relevant virus, and specific model for lipid-enveloped RNA viruses, including the arboviruses, which contains both Flavividae and Togaviridae and includes equine encephalitis viruses (Toga family) and equine viral arteritis (Arteri family, formerly a Toga virus).</p><p>PRV: Pseudorabies Virus; specific model for equine herpes viruses and non-specific model for lipid-enveloped viruses.</p><p>PI3: Parainfluenza III Virus; model for lipid enveloped RNA viruses, and viruses of the similar family, orthomyxo, which includes equine influenza virus.</p><p>Ad2: Adenovirus; specific model for equine adenovirus.</p><p>EMC: Encephalomyocarditis Virus; specific model for equine parvovirus and adeno-associated virus, non-specific model for small lipid and non-lipid enveloped viruses.</p><p>n.t.: not tested</p><p><br/>
BAT is formulated with 10% maltose and 0.03% polysorbate 80. The formulated bulk material contains approximately 3-7 g% (30-70 milligrams/milliliter) protein.</p><p>The product potency is expressed in units based on the mouse neutralization assay (MNA). Each unit of BAT is designed to neutralize 10,000 mouse intraperitoneal lethal dose 50% units (MIPLD<span class="Sub">50</span>) of botulinum neurotoxin for serotype A, B, C, D, F, and G and 1,000 MIPLD<span class="Sub">50</span> of serotype E.</p><h2>BAT Botulism Antitoxin - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of BAT is through passive immunization with equine polyclonal antibody fragments (primarily F(ab′)<span class="Sub">2</span> and Fab) against botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. In the circulation the polyclonal antibody fragments bind to free BoNT. This prevents the BoNT from interacting with ganglioside anchorage sites and protein receptors on the cholinergic nerve endings. In turn this prevents BoNT internalization into the target cells. The antibody/antigen complexes are then cleared from the circulation by the organs involved in processing immune complexes.</p><p>Experimental evidence concerning the amount of circulating antitoxin needed to counteract BoNT intoxication is not fully documented. The outcome of treatment depends, as it does with other comparable conditions, largely on the time interval elapsing after the onset of symptoms and antitoxin administration.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A proof-of-concept clinical dose-response trial was conducted using the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscle of the foot as a model for measuring muscle paralysis after exposure to botulism toxin. In this model, BAT prevented subjects from experiencing a decrease in muscle function after exposure to botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) serotypes A and B. Subjects treated with placebo (n=10) demonstrated a loss of greater than 50% EDB muscle function within 3 days of exposure to BoNT serotypes A and B. In the BAT arm of the trial (n=16), EDB muscle function was stable over time indicating that BAT was effective in preserving muscle function for up to 28 days following exposure to both BoNT serotype A and B.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics (PK) of the seven botulism antitoxin serotypes was determined in healthy human subjects following IV administration of either one (n=20) or two vials (n=20) of BAT. The various PK parameters are summarized in Table 5.</p><p>The PK parameters varied based upon the antitoxin serotype measured. Antitoxin serotypes D and E had the shortest half-lives.

The safety has been tested in healthy adults and patients with suspected botulism who were treated with BAT under an expanded access clinical study.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of BAT have been evaluated in two clinical studies. In these clinical studies, BAT was shown to have an acceptable safety profile when one or two vials of BAT were administered intravenously to healthy subjects.</p><p>In a randomized, single-center, double-blind trial the pharmacokinetics and safety of BAT was evaluated in 40 healthy subjects receiving either one (n = 20) or two (n = 20) vials of BAT by IV infusion. Serum BAT levels were measured in the subjects using the Mouse Neutralization Assay (MNA) <span class="Emphasis">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In a randomized single center, double-blind trial the pharmacodynamics and safety of BAT was evaluated in 26 healthy subjects receiving either a single vial of BAT (n=16) or placebo (n=10) by IV infusion. The effects of BAT in preventing paralysis of the EDB foot muscle following administration of botulinum neurotoxin serotype A or B was determined <span class="Emphasis">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p>To provide additional support for the efficacy demonstrated in the animal models, a preliminary analysis of data from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) open-label, observational expanded access clinical study for the treatment of subjects with suspected or confirmed botulism with BAT was conducted. Across the 148 subjects treated with BAT in the period analyzed, 109 subjects had a final discharge diagnosis of suspected or confirmed botulism and were included in the analysis population. The median time from the onset of botulism symptoms to treatment with BAT was 3.6 days (range: 0.25 – 38 days). Early treatment (≤ 2 days after onset of symptoms) with BAT was associated with a shorter length of hospitalization, duration in intensive care unit (ICU) and duration of mechanical ventilation compared to later treatment [Table 8] and is consistent with the mechanism of action <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1 Mechanism of Action</span>)<span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Time from Symptoms to Treatment</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Number of Patients</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean Duration in Days (SD)</span></p><p class="First">Hospitalization</p><p class="First">≤ 2 Days</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">12.4 (9.28)</p><p class="First">&gt; 2 Days</p><p class="First">72</p><p class="First">26.1 (26.37)</p><p class="First">ICU Stay</p><p class="First">≤ 2 Days</p><p class="First">13</p><p class="First">9.2 (7.40)</p><p class="First">&gt; 2 Days</p><p class="First">70</p><p class="First">15.8 (18.76)</p><p class="First">Mechanical Ventilation</p><p class="First">≤ 2 Days</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">11.6 (7.83)</p><p class="First">&gt; 2 Days</p><p class="First">41</p><p class="First">23.4 (21.11)</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">BAT is supplied in either 20 milliliter or 50 milliliter glass vials seated with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum seal with a plastic flip-top cap, with a fill volume ranging from 10 to 22 milliliters per vial.

After a person is exposed to the toxin, problems can start as early as three hours or as late as a few days. It can take weeks or months to get better. During that time, many people need special care in the hospital.</p><p>The effectiveness of BAT has been studied in animals with botulism.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is BAT?</span></p><p>BAT is a botulism antitoxin made from the plasma of horses. It contains antibody fragments which can neutralize botulism toxins. BAT may make the illness from botulism less severe. Treatment with BAT will not reverse the paralysis, but may decrease the duration and extent of paralysis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Who should use BAT?</span></p><p>Your doctor may give you BAT if they suspect that you have been exposed to botulism toxin. You should get the treatment as quickly as possible to stop the progression of the illness.</p><p>Unless the benefits outweigh the risks, you should not receive BAT if you have a known history of allergies to horses or horse blood products, asthma or hay fever (seasonal allergies).</p><p><span class="Bold">How will you receive BAT?</span></p><p>BAT is given as an injection into your vein. Your doctor will determine the dose of BAT. The treatment may take several hours to administer. Your doctor will decide if you need more than one injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are the possible or reasonably likely side effects of BAT?</span></p><p>The most common side effects of BAT are:</p><p>Some people have a chilly feeling, difficulty breathing, and have a quick rise in body temperature within the first 20 to 60 minutes after getting BAT. This can be managed by your doctor.</p><p>BAT can cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor or go to the emergency department right away if you have trouble breathing, swelling of your tongue or lips, or a very fast heart rate because this can be signs of a serious allergic reaction.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you get pains in your joints and back, fever, and a rash within one to three weeks after getting BAT. These can be signs of “serum sickness” and can last for a few weeks. Your doctor can give you medicine to help with serum sickness.</p><p>Talk to your doctor about any side effects that concern you. You can ask your doctor for additional prescribing information that is available to healthcare professionals.</p><p><span class="Bold">What other information do you need to know about BAT?</span></p><p>BAT is made from horse plasma. The horses are carefully screened and the plasma is carefully cleaned, but there is a small risk that it may give you a virus. Talk to your doctor if you have any symptoms that concern you.</p><p>You may report side effects directly to Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc. at 1-800-768-2304 or to the FDA’s MedWatch reporting system at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p><p>BAT<span class="Sup">®</span> and any and all Emergent BioSolutions Inc. brand, product, service and feature names, logos and slogans are trademarks or registered trademarks of Emergent BioSolutions Inc. or its subsidiaries in the United States or other countries.
