</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Mumpsvax</h2><p>Mumps Virus Vaccine Live is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection by the mumps virus. It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus infection.</p><p>Mumps is an infection that can cause serious problems, such as encephalitis and meningitis, which affect the brain. In addition, adolescent boys and men are very susceptible to a condition called orchitis, which causes pain and swelling in the testicles and scrotum and, in rare cases, sterility. Also, mumps infection can cause spontaneous abortion in women during the first 3 months of pregnancy.</p><p>Immunization against mumps is recommended for all persons 12 months of age or older.</p><p>Immunization against mumps is not recommended for infants less than 12 months of age, because antibodies they received from their mothers before birth may interfere with the effectiveness of the vaccine. Children who were immunized against mumps before 12 months of age should be immunized again.</p><p>You can be considered to be immune to mumps only if you:</p><ul>
<li>received mumps vaccine on or after your first birthday and have the medical record to prove it, or</li>
<li>have a doctor's diagnosis of a previous mumps infection, or</li>
<li>have had a laboratory test that shows that you are immune to mumps.</li>
</ul><p>This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor or other health care professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Mumpsvax</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Use is not recommended for infants up to 12 months of age. Children who received the vaccine when less than 12 months of age should receive another dose of the vaccine at 12 months of age.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.
