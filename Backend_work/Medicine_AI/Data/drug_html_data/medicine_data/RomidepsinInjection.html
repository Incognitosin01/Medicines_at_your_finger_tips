</ul><h3>Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose of Romidepsin Injection as shown in Table 1 and monitor for toxicities more frequently. Dose adjustment is not required for patients with mild hepatic impairment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Bilirubin Levels</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Romidepsin </span><span class="Bold">Injection Dose</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Moderate</span></p><p class="First">&gt; 1.5 x ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN</p><p class="First">7 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Severe</span></p><p class="First">&gt; 3 x ULN</p><p class="First">5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">ULN=Upper limit of normal.</p><h3>Instructions for Preparation and Intravenous Administration</h3><p class="First">Romidepsin Injection is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>Romidepsin Injection must be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP before intravenous infusion.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Extract the appropriate amount of Romidepsin Injection from the vial to deliver the desired dose, using proper aseptic technique. Before intravenous infusion, dilute Romidepsin Injection in 500 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.</li>
<li>Infuse over 4 hours.</li>
</ul><p>The diluted solution is compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene (PE) infusion bags as well as glass bottles, and is chemically stable for up to 24 hours when stored at room temperature. However, it should be administered as soon after dilution as possible.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: 10 mg/2 mL (5 mg/mL) and 27.5 mg/5.5 mL (5 mg/mL) in single-dose vials.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">Treatment with romidepsin can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and anemia. Monitor blood counts regularly during treatment with Romidepsin Injection and modify the dose as necessary <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Fatal and serious infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and viral reactivation, including Epstein Barr and hepatitis B viruses, have been reported in clinical trials with romidepsin. These can occur during treatment and within 30 days after treatment. The risk of life threatening infections may be greater in patients with a history of prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against lymphocyte antigens and in patients with disease involvement of the bone marrow <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection has occurred in 1% of PTCL patients in clinical trials in Western populations <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection, consider monitoring for reactivation, and consider antiviral prophylaxis.</p><p>Reactivation of Epstein Barr viral infection leading to liver failure has occurred in a trial of patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. In one case, ganciclovir prophylaxis failed to prevent Epstein Barr viral reactivation.</p><h3>Electrocardiographic Changes</h3><p class="First">Several treatment-emergent morphological changes in ECGs (including T-wave and ST-segment changes) have been reported in clinical studies. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients with a history of significant cardiovascular disease, and patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicines or medicinal products that lead to significant QT prolongation, consider cardiovascular monitoring of ECGs at baseline and periodically during treatment.</p><p>Confirm that potassium and magnesium levels are within normal range before administration of Romidepsin Injection <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Tumor Lysis Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported to occur in 1% of patients with tumor stage CTCL and 2% of patients with Stage III/IV PTCL. Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden are at greater risk, should be closely monitored, and managed as appropriate.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, Romidepsin Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproductive study, romidepsin was embryocidal and caused adverse developmental outcomes at exposures below those in patients at the recommended dose of 14 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose. Advise males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information.</p><ul class="Disc">

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; however, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In a hepatic impairment study, romidepsin was evaluated in 19 patients with advanced cancer and mild (8), moderate (5), or severe (6) hepatic impairment. There were 4 deaths during the first cycle of treatment: 1 patient with mild hepatic impairment, 1 patient with moderate hepatic impairment, and 2 patients with severe hepatic impairment. No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Reduce the Romidepsin Injection starting dose for patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment more frequently for toxicity, especially during the first cycle of therapy.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage of romidepsin. Toxicities in a single-dose study in rats or dogs, at intravenous romidepsin doses up to 2.2-fold the recommended human dose based on the body surface area, included irregular respiration, irregular heartbeat, staggering gait, tremor, and tonic convulsions. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., clinical monitoring and supportive therapy, if required. There is no known antidote for romidepsin and it is not known if romidepsin is dialyzable.</p><h2>Romidepsin Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Romidepsin, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, is a bicyclic depsipeptide. At room temperature, romidepsin is a white to off-white solid and is described chemically as (1<span class="Italics">S</span>,4<span class="Italics">S</span>,7<span class="Italics">Z</span>,10<span class="Italics">S</span>,16<span class="Italics">E</span>,21<span class="Italics">R</span>)-7-ethylidene-4,21-bis (1-methylethyl)-2-oxa-12,13-dithia-5,8,20,23-tetraazabicyclo[8.7.6]tricos-16-ene-3,6,9,19,22-pentone.

Each mL contains romidepsin 5 mg, povidone 10 mg, DL-alpha-tocopherol 0.05 mg, dehydrated alcohol 157.8 mg (20.1% v/v), and propylene glycol 828.8 mg.</p><h2>Romidepsin Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from acetylated lysine residues in histones, resulting in the modulation of gene expression. HDACs also deacetylate non-histone proteins, such as transcription factors. In vitro, romidepsin causes the accumulation of acetylated histones, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of some cancer cell lines with IC<span class="Sub">50</span> values in the nanomolar range. The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of romidepsin observed in nonclinical and clinical studies has not been fully characterized.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>At doses of 14 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> as a 4-hour intravenous infusion and at doses of 8 (0.57 times the recommended dose), 10 (0.71 times the recommended dose) or 12 (0.86 times the recommended dose) mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> as a 1-hour infusion, no large changes in the mean QTc interval (&gt;20 milliseconds) from baseline based on Fridericia correction method were detected. Small increase in mean QT interval (&lt; 10 milliseconds) and mean QT interval increase between 10 to 20 milliseconds cannot be excluded.</p><p>Romidepsin was associated with a delayed concentration-dependent increase in heart rate in patients with advanced cancer with a maximum mean increase in heart rate of 20 beats per minute occurring at the 6-hour time point after start of romidepsin infusion for patients receiving 14 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> as a 4-hour infusion.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">In patients with T-cell lymphomas who received 14 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of romidepsin intravenously over a 4-hour period on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, geometric mean values of the maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span>) were 377 ng/mL and 1549 ng*hr/mL, respectively. Romidepsin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across doses ranging from 1.0 (0.07 times the recommended dose) to 24.9 (1.76 times the recommended dose) mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> when administered intravenously over 4 hours in patients with advanced cancers.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Romidepsin is highly protein bound in plasma (92% to 94%) over the concentration range of 50 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL with α1-acid-glycoprotein (AAG) being the principal binding protein. Romidepsin is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1).</p><p>In vitro, romidepsin accumulates into human hepatocytes via an unknown active uptake process. Romidepsin is not a substrate of the following uptake transporters: BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT2. In addition, romidepsin is not an inhibitor of BCRP, MRP2, MDR1 or OAT3. Although romidepsin did not inhibit OAT1, OCT2, and OATP1B3 at concentrations seen clinically (1 μmol/L), modest inhibition was observed at 10 μmol/L. Romidepsin was found to be an inhibitor of BSEP and OATP1B1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Romidepsin undergoes extensive metabolism in vitro primarily by CYP3A4 with minor contribution from CYP3A5, CYP1A1, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19. At therapeutic concentrations, romidepsin did not competitively inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 in vitro.</p><p>At therapeutic concentrations, romidepsin did not cause notable induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Therefore, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions are unlikely to occur due to CYP450 induction or inhibition by romidepsin when coadministered with CYP450 substrates.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Following 4-hour intravenous administration of romidepsin at 14 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle in patients with T-cell lymphomas, the terminal half-life (t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) was approximately 3 hours. No accumulation of plasma concentration of romidepsin was observed after repeated dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Ketoconazole</span></p><p>Following coadministration of 8 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> romidepsin  (4-hour infusion) with ketoconazole, the overall romidepsin exposure was increased by approximately 25% and 10% for AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span>, respectively, compared to romidepsin alone, and the difference in AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> between the 2 treatments was statistically significant.</p><p><span class="Italics">Rifampin</span></p><p>Following coadministration of 14 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> romidepsin (4-hour infusion) with rifampin, the overall romidepsin exposure was increased by approximately 80% and 60% for AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span>, respectively, compared to romidepsin alone, and the difference between the 2 treatments was statistically significant. Coadministration of rifampin decreased the romidepsin clearance and volume of distribution by 44% and 52%, respectively. The increase in exposure seen after coadministration with rifampin is likely due to rifampin’s inhibition of an undetermined hepatic uptake process that is predominant for the disposition of romidepsin .</p><p><span class="Italics">Drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein</span></p><p>Drugs that inhibit p-glycoprotein may increase the concentration of romidepsin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Age, Gender, Race or Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of romidepsin was not influenced by age (27 to 83 yrs), gender, race (white vs. black) or mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (estimated creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min), or severe (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) renal impairment. The effect of end-stage renal disease (estimated creatine clearance less than 15 mL/min) on romidepsin pharmacokinetics has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Romidepsin clearance decreased with increased severity of hepatic impairment.

The geometric mean AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span> values in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment were approximately 144%, 114%, and 116% of the corresponding value in patients with normal hepatic function, respectively. Among these 4 cohorts, moderate interpatient variability was noted for the exposure parameters C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">inf</span>, as the coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 30% to 54%.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with romidepsin. Romidepsin was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or the mouse lymphoma assay. Romidepsin was not clastogenic in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay when tested to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 1 mg/kg in males and 3 mg/kg in females (6 and 18 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in males and females, respectively). These doses were up to 1.3-fold the recommended human dose, based on body surface area.</p><p>Based on nonclinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with romidepsin. In a 26-week toxicology study, romidepsin administration resulted in testicular degeneration in rats at 0.33 mg/kg/dose (2 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/dose) following the clinical dosing schedule. This dose resulted in AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> values that were approximately 2% the exposure level in patients receiving the recommended dose of 14 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/dose. A similar effect was seen in mice after 4 weeks of drug administration at higher doses. Seminal vesicle and prostate organ weights were decreased in a separate study in rats after 4 weeks of daily drug administration at 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.6 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), approximately 30% the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area. Romidepsin showed high affinity for binding to estrogen receptors in pharmacology studies. In a 26-week toxicology study in rats, atrophy was seen in the ovary, uterus, vagina and mammary gland of females administered doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg/dose (0.6 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/dose) following the clinical dosing schedule. This dose resulted in AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> values that were 0.3% of those in patients receiving the recommended dose of 14 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/dose. Maturation arrest of ovarian follicles and decreased weight of ovaries were observed in a separate study in rats after 4 weeks of daily drug administration at 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.6 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). This dose is approximately 30% the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</h3><p class="First">Romidepsin was evaluated in 2 multicenter, single-arm clinical studies in patients with CTCL. Overall, 167 patients with CTCL were treated in the US, Europe, and Australia. Study 1 included 96 patients with confirmed CTCL after failure of at least 1 prior systemic therapy. Study 2 included 71 patients with a primary diagnosis of CTCL who received at least 2 prior skin directed therapies or one or more systemic therapies.
