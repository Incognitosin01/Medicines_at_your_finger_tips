Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p><b>Ask a doctor before using Combunox if you are breastfeeding.</b> Tell your doctor if you notice severe drowsiness or slow breathing in the nursing baby.</p><h2>How should I take Combunox?</h2><p>Take Combunox exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use Combunox in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Use the lowest dose that is effective in treating your condition. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to take more of this medicine.</p><p><b>Never share Combunox with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medicine in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.</p><p>Store Combunox at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using Combunox accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program.

Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An opioid overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include black or bloody stools, coughing up blood, severe drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, slow breathing, or no breathing.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you get naloxone (a medicine to reverse an opioid overdose) and keep it with you at all times. A person caring for you can give the naloxone if you stop breathing or don't wake up. Your caregiver must still get emergency medical help and may need to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on you while waiting for help to arrive.</p><p>Anyone can buy naloxone from a pharmacy or local health department. Make sure any person caring for you knows where you keep naloxone and how to use it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how Combunox will affect you. Dizziness or drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries.</p><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using other medicines for pain, fever, swelling, or cold/flu symptoms. They may contain ingredients similar to ibuprofen (such as aspirin, ketoprofen, or naproxen).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Combunox side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Combunox</b> (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) <b>or a severe skin reaction</b> (fever, sore throat, burning in your eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling).</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of a heart attack or stroke:</b> chest pain spreading to your jaw or shoulder, sudden numbness or weakness on one side of the body, slurred speech, leg, swelling, feeling short of breath.</p><p>The oxycodone in Combunox can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur.
