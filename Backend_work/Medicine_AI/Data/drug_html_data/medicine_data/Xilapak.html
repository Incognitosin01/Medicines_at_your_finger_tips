The active component is the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide, which has the chemical name pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione,6,9-difluoro-11,21-dihydroxy16,17[(methylethylidene)bis(oxy)]-, (6α,11β,16α)-. It has the following chemical structure:</p><p></p><p>Fluocinolone Acetonide Solution USP contains fluocinolone acetonide 0.1 mg/mL in a water-washable base of citric acid and propylene glycol.</p><h2>Xilapak - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions.</p><p>The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings.</p><p>Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase the percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses (See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Xilapak</h2><p class="First">Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Solution is indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of components of the preparation.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria in some patients.</p><p>Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.</p><p>Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.</p><p>Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.</p><p>Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical-corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS – Pediatric Use</span>).</p><p>If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><p>As with any topical corticosteroid product, prolonged use may produce atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. When used on intertriginous or flexor areas, or on the face, this may occur even with short-term use.</p><p>In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.</p><h3>Information for the Patient</h3><p class="First">Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The following tests may be helpful in evaluating HPA axis suppression:</p><p>Urinary free cortisol test<br/>
ACTH stimulation test</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids.</p><p>Studies to determine mutagenicity with prednisolone and hydrocortisone have revealed negative results.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C</h3><p class="First">Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio.</span></p><p>Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.</p><p>Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids, but may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence:</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Topically applied corticosteroids can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects (See <span class="Italics">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><h2>Xilapak Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Solution is generally applied to the affected area as a thin film from two to four times daily depending on the severity of the condition. In hairy sites, the hair should be parted to allow direct contact with the lesion.</p><p>Occlusive dressing may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions.</p><p>If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.</p><h2>How is Xilapak Supplied</h2><p class="First">Fluocinolone Acetonide Topical Solution 0.01%<br/>

This tape is designed to not harm the skin when it is being removed. Most tapes pull the skin and the small hairs, causing unnecessary damage. This Silicone tape has a paper blended backing that allows a gentle, but strong adhesion to the skin that remains constant. Most tapes increase their adhesion over time, which increases the damage when they are removed.</p><p>The silicone tape can be re-positioned without losing any of its tacky qualities. The gentle adhesion does not lower the quality of the hold either. This tape is adhesive enough that it can be worn in the shower without losing effectiveness.</p><h2>Purpose</h2><p class="First">For alleviating tension on the scar and its surrounding skin. Tension on a wound and scar is known to increase scar tissue formation.</p><p>Because of its adherence, silicone tape reduces tension (e.g. tear and stretch) along the incision line or wound which is known to minimize the degree of scarring in terms of spreading or thickening.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. Avoid contact with eyes, lips or mucous membranes. Do not use on areas of broken skin. Do not use if you have known hypersensitivity to silicone</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Stop use and ask a doctor if redness or irritation or rash develops. Keep out of reach of children.</p><h2>Directions</h2><p class="First">Apply to the affected area as directed by your physician.</p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL - Kit Carton</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Solutech</span><br/>
