Water consumption during cold months (winter) may drop markedly (30-40%).  Accordingly, adjustments must be made in the dilution rates to compensate for this and unsure proper drug intake.</p><p>For treatment of individual cattle, Sulfadimethoxine Soluble Powder stock solution for cattle may be given as a drench.</p><p>Twenty fl.oz. of cattle stock solution will medicate one-600lb animal initially or two-600lb animals on a maintenance dose.  Contents of packet will medicate six-600lb animals initially or twelve-600lb animals on a maintenance dose.</p><p>During treatment period, make certain that animals maintain adequate water intake.</p><p>If animals show no improvement within 2 or 3 days, re-evaluate diagnosis.  Treatment should not be continued beyond 5 days.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p class="First">RESIDUE WARNINGS:  CHICKENS AND TURKEYS - Withddraw 5 days before slaughter.
