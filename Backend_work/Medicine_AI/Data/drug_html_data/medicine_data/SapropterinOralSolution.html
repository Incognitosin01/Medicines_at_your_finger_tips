</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Sapropterin Oral Solution</h2><p class="First">Sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution is indicated to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult and pediatric patients one month of age and older with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) due to tetrahydrobiopterin-(BH4-) responsive Phenylketonuria (PKU). Sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution is to be used in conjunction with a Phe-restricted diet.</p><h2>Sapropterin Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">Treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution should be directed by physicians knowledgeable in the management of PKU.</p><p>All patients with PKU who are being treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution should also be treated with a Phe-restricted diet, including dietary protein and Phe restriction.</p><p><span class="Bold">Starting Dosage</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients 1 month to 6 years</span>: The recommended starting dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution is 10 mg/kg taken once daily.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients 7 years and older</span>: The recommended starting dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution is 10 to 20 mg/kg taken once daily.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosage Adjustment (Evaluation Period)</span></p><p>Existing dietary protein and Phe intake should not be modified during the evaluation period.</p><p>If a 10 mg/kg per day starting dose is used, then response to therapy is determined by change in blood Phe following treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution at 10 mg/kg per day for a period of up to 1 month. Blood Phe levels should be checked after 1 week of sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution treatment and periodically for up to a month. If blood Phe does not decrease from baseline at 10 mg/kg per day, the dose may be increased to 20 mg/kg per day. Patients whose blood Phe does not decrease after 1 month of treatment at 20 mg/kg per day do not show a biochemical response and treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution should be discontinued in these patients.</p><p>If a 20 mg/kg per day starting dose is used, then response to therapy is determined by change in blood Phe following treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution at 20 mg/kg per day for a period of 1 month. Blood Phe levels should be checked after 1 week of sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution treatment and periodically during the first month. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who do not show a biochemical response (blood Phe does not decrease) after 1 month of treatment at 20 mg/kg per day <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Once responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution has been established, the dosage may be adjusted within the range of 5 to 20 mg/kg per day according to biochemical response to therapy (blood Phe). Periodic blood Phe monitoring is recommended to assess blood Phe control, especially in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Take sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution orally with a meal, preferably at the same time each day <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.

The powder is off-white to lightly yellow in color.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">Sapropterin dihydrochloride is not recommended in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to sapropterin dihydrochloride. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and rash, have occurred <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> Signs of anaphylaxis include wheezing, dyspnea, coughing, hypotension, flushing, nausea, and rash. Discontinue treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride in patients who experience anaphylaxis and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Continue dietary protein and Phe restriction in patients who experience anaphylaxis.</p><h3>Upper Gastrointestinal Mucosal Inflammation</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions suggestive of upper GI mucosal inflammation have been reported with sapropterin dihydrochloride. Serious adverse reactions included esophagitis and gastritis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. If left untreated, these could lead to severe sequelae including esophageal stricture, esophageal ulcer, gastric ulcer, and bleeding and such complications have been reported in patients receiving sapropterin dihydrochloride. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of upper GI mucosal inflammation.</span></p><h3>Hypophenylalaninemia</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials of sapropterin dihydrochloride, some PKU patients experienced hypophenylalaninemia (low blood Phe) during treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride. In a clinical study of pediatric patients younger than 7 years old treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg per day, the incidence of hypophenylalaninemia was higher than in clinical trials of older patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Monitoring Blood Phe Levels During Treatment</h3><p class="First">Prolonged elevations of blood Phe levels in patients with PKU can result in severe neurologic damage, including severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities. Conversely, prolonged levels of blood Phe that are too low have been associated with catabolism and endogenous protein breakdown, which has been associated with adverse developmental outcomes. Active management of dietary Phe intake while taking sapropterin dihydrochloride is required to ensure adequate Phe control and nutritional balance. Monitor blood Phe levels during treatment to ensure adequate blood Phe level control. Frequent blood monitoring is recommended in the pediatric population <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Lack of Biochemical Response to Sapropterin Dihydrochloride</h3><p class="First">Some patients with PKU do not show biochemical response (reduction in blood Phe) with treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride. In two clinical trials at a sapropterin dihydrochloride dose of 20 mg/kg per day, 56% to 75% of pediatric PKU patients showed a biochemical response to sapropterin dihydrochloride, and in one clinical trial at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day, 20% of adult and pediatric PKU patients showed a biochemical response to sapropterin dihydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>Biochemical response to sapropterin dihydrochloride treatment cannot generally be pre-determined by laboratory testing (e.g., molecular testing), and should be determined through a therapeutic trial (evaluation) of sapropterin dihydrochloride response <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Interaction with Levodopa</h3><p class="First">In a 10-year post-marketing safety surveillance program for a non-PKU indication using another sapropterin product, 3 patients with underlying neurological disorders experienced seizures, exacerbation of seizures, over-stimulation, and irritability during co-administration of levodopa and sapropterin. Monitor patients who are receiving levodopa for changes in neurological status during treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Hyperactivity</h3><p class="First">In the sapropterin dihydrochloride post-marketing safety surveillance program, 2 patients with PKU experienced hyperactivity when treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Monitor patients for hyperactivity.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">PKU Clinical Studies</span></p><p>The safety of sapropterin dihydrochloride was evaluated in 7 clinical studies in patients with PKU (aged 1 month to 50 years) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>In Studies 1 to 4 (controlled and uncontrolled studies), 579 patients with PKU aged 4 to 49 years received sapropterin dihydrochloride in doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg/kg per day for lengths of treatment ranging from 1 to 164 weeks. The patient population was evenly distributed in gender, and approximately 95% of patients were Caucasian. The most common adverse reactions (≥4% of patients) were headache, rhinorrhea, pharyngolaryngeal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and nasal congestion.</p><p>The data described in Table 3 reflect exposure of 74 patients with PKU to sapropterin dihydrochloride at doses of 10 to 20 mg/kg per day for 6 to 10 weeks in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 2 and 4).</p><p>Table 3 enumerates adverse reactions occurring in at least 4% of patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride in the double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials described above.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Summary of Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥4% of Patients in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies with Sapropterin Dihydrochloride</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Me</span><span class="Bold">d</span><span class="Bold">DRA Preferred Term</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T</span><span class="Bold">re</span><span class="Bold">atment</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Sapropterin Dihydrochloride</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(</span><span class="Bold">N=74)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">P</span><span class="Bold">lacebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(</span><span class="Bold">N=59)</span></p><p class="First">No. Patients (%)</p><p class="First">No. Patients (%)</p><p class="First">Headache</p><p class="First">11 (15)</p><p class="First">8 (14)</p><p class="First">Rhinorrhea</p><p class="First">8 (11)</p><p class="First">0</p><p class="First">Pharyngolaryngeal pain</p><p class="First">7 (10)</p><p class="First">1 (2)</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">6 (8)</p><p class="First">3 (5)</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">6 (8)</p><p class="First">4 (7)</p><p class="First">Cough</p><p class="First">5 (7)</p><p class="First">3 (5)</p><p class="First">Nasal congestion</p><p class="First">3 (4)</p><p class="First">0</p><p>In open-label, uncontrolled clinical trials (Studies 1 and 3) all patients received sapropterin dihydrochloride in doses of 5 to 20 mg/kg per day, and adverse reactions were similar in type and frequency to those reported in the double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>In Study 5, 65 pediatric patients with PKU aged 1 month to 6 years received sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg per day for 6 months.

Twenty-five percent (16 out of 65) of patients developed Phe levels below normal for age <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Pediatric Use (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>In Study 6, a long term, open-label, extension study of 111 patients aged 4 to 50 years, receiving sapropterin dihydrochloride in doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg/kg per day, adverse reactions were similar in type and frequency to those reported in the previous clinical studies. Fifty-five patients received sapropterin dihydrochloride both as dissolved and intact tablets. There were no notable differences in the incidence or severity of adverse reactions between the two methods of administration. The mean (± SD) exposure to sapropterin for the entire study population was 659 ± 221 days (maximum 953 days).</p><p>In Study 7, 27 pediatric patients with PKU aged 0 to 4 years received sapropterin dihydrochloride 10 mg/kg per day or 20 mg/kg per day.

In these clinical trials, subjects were administered sapropterin at doses ranging from 1 to 100 mg/kg per day for lengths of exposure from 1 day to 2 years. Serious and severe adverse reactions (regardless of causality) during sapropterin administration were seizures, exacerbation of seizures <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>, dizziness, gastrointestinal bleeding, post-procedural bleeding, headache, irritability, myocardial infarction, overstimulation, and respiratory failure. Common adverse reactions were headache, peripheral edema, arthralgia, polyuria, agitation, dizziness, nausea, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, and upper respiratory tract infection.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of sapropterin dihydrochloride.

It is not known whether these patients respond differently than younger patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Two unintentional overdosages with sapropterin dihydrochloride have been reported. One adult patient in a sapropterin dihydrochloride clinical trial received a single sapropterin dihydrochloride dose of 4,500 mg (36 mg/kg) instead of 2,600 mg (20 mg/kg). The patient reported mild headache and mild dizziness immediately after taking the dose; both symptoms resolved within 1 hour with no treatment intervention. There were no associated laboratory test abnormalities. The patient suspended therapy for 24 hours and then restarted sapropterin dihydrochloride with no reports of abnormal signs or symptoms. In postmarketing, one pediatric patient received sapropterin dihydrochloride doses of 45 mg/kg per day instead of 20 mg/kg per day. The patient reported hyperactivity that began at an unspecified time after overdosage and resolved after the sapropterin dihydrochloride dose was reduced to 20 mg/kg per day.</p><p>In a clinical study to evaluate the effects of sapropterin dihydrochloride on cardiac repolarization, a single supra-therapeutic dose of 100 mg/kg (5 times the maximum recommended dose) was administered to 54 healthy adults. No serious adverse reactions were reported during the study. The only adverse reactions reported in more than 1 subject who received the supra-therapeutic dose were upper abdominal pain (6%) and dizziness (4%). A dose-dependent shortening of the QT interval was observed <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Patients should be advised to notify their physicians in cases of overdosage.</p><h2>Sapropterin Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Sapropterin dihydrochloride is an orally administered Phenylalanine Hydroxylase activator (or PAH activator). Sapropterin dihydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution, is a synthetic preparation of the dihydrochloride salt of naturally occurring tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Sapropterin dihydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder.</p><p>The chemical name of sapropterin dihydrochloride is (6R)-2-amino-6-[(1R,2S)-1,2-dihydroxypropyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4(1H)-pteridinone dihydrochloride and the molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">9</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>·2HCl with a molecular weight of 314.17.</p><p>Sapropterin dihydrochloride has the following structural formula:</p><p>Sapropterin dihydrochloride is supplied as powder for oral solution containing 500 mg of sapropterin dihydrochloride (equivalent to 384 mg of sapropterin base).</p><p>Sapropterin dihydrochloride powder for oral solution is off-white to lightly yellow in color. Each unit dose packet contains the following inactive ingredients: ascorbic acid, mannitol, potassium citrate and sucralose.</p><h2>Sapropterin Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Sapropterin dihydrochloride is a synthetic form of BH4, the cofactor for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PAH hydroxylates Phe through an oxidative reaction to form tyrosine. In patients with PKU, PAH activity is absent or deficient. Treatment with BH4 can activate residual PAH enzyme activity, improve the normal oxidative metabolism of Phe, and decrease Phe levels in some patients.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In PKU patients who are responsive to BH4 treatment, blood Phe levels decrease within 24 hours after a single administration of sapropterin dihydrochloride, although maximal effect on Phe level may take up to a month, depending on the patient. A single daily dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride is adequate to maintain stable blood Phe levels over a 24-hour period. Twelve patients with blood Phe levels ranging from 516 to 986 μmol/L (mean 747 ± 153 μmol/L) were assessed with 24-hour blood Phe level monitoring following a daily morning dose of 10 mg/kg per day. The blood Phe level remained stable during a 24-hour observation period. No substantial increases in blood Phe levels were observed following food intake throughout the 24-hour period.</p><p>Sapropterin dihydrochloride dose-response relationship was studied in an open-label, forced titration study at doses of 5 mg/kg per day, then 20 mg/kg per day, and then 10 mg/kg per day (Study 3) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. Individual blood Phe levels were highly variable among patients. The mean blood Phe level observed at the end of each 2-week dosing period decreased as the dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride increased, demonstrating an inverse relationship between the dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride and mean blood Phe levels.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>A thorough QTc study was performed in 56 healthy adults. This randomized, placebo and active controlled crossover study was conducted to determine if a single supra-therapeutic (100 mg/kg) dose of sapropterin dihydrochloride or a single therapeutic dose (20 mg/kg) of sapropterin dihydrochloride had an effect on cardiac repolarization. In this study, sapropterin dihydrochloride was administered after dissolving tablets in water under fed condition. This study demonstrated a dose-dependent shortening of the QT interval. The maximum placebo-subtracted mean change from baseline of the QTc interval was -3.69 and -8.32 ms (lower bound of 90% CI: -5.3 and -10.6 ms) at 20 and 100 mg/kg, respectively.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Studies in healthy subjects have shown comparable absorption of sapropterin when tablets are dissolved in water or orange juice and taken under fasted conditions. Administration of dissolved tablets after a high-fat/high-calorie meal resulted in mean increases in C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 84% and AUC of 87% (dissolved in water). However, there was extensive variability in individual subject values for C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC across the different modes of administration and meal conditions. In the clinical trials of sapropterin dihydrochloride, drug was administered in the morning as a dissolved tablet without regard to meals. The mean elimination half-life in PKU patients was approximately 6.7 hours (range 3.9 to 17 hours), comparable with values seen in healthy subjects (range 3 to 5.3 hours).</p><p>A study in healthy adults with 10 mg/kg of sapropterin dihydrochloride demonstrated that the absorption via intact tablet administration was 40% greater than via dissolved tablet administration under fasted conditions based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-t</span>. The administration of intact tablets under fed conditions resulted in an approximately 43% increase in the extent of absorption compared to fasted conditions based on AUC<span class="Sub">0-t </span><span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sapropterin including patients from 1 month to 49 years of age showed that body weight is the only covariate substantially affecting clearance or distribution volume (see Table 5).

In the 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats, sapropterin dihydrochloride doses of 25, 80, and 250 mg/kg per day (0.2, 0.7, and 2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/kg per day, respectively, based on body surface area) were used. In the 78-week oral carcinogenicity study in mice, sapropterin dihydrochloride doses of 25, 80, and 250 mg/kg per day (0.1, 0.3, and 2 times the recommended human dose, respectively, based on body surface area) were used. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma in male rats treated with the 250 mg/kg per day (about 2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area) dose, as compared to vehicle treated rats. The mouse carcinogenicity study showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect, but the study was not ideal due to its duration of 78 instead of 104 weeks.</p><p>Sapropterin dihydrochloride was genotoxic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames test at concentrations of 625 mcg (TA98) and 5,000 mcg (TA100) per plate, without metabolic activation. However, no genotoxicity was observed in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames test with metabolic activation. Sapropterin dihydrochloride was genotoxic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mM. Sapropterin dihydrochloride was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay in mice at doses up to 2,000 mg/kg per day (about 8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/kg per day, based on body surface area). Sapropterin dihydrochloride, at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg per day (about 3 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive function of male and female rats.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride was evaluated in five clinical studies in patients with PKU.</p><p>Study 1 was a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial of 489 patients with PKU, ages 8 to 48 years (mean 22 years), who had baseline blood Phe levels ≥ 450 μmol/L and who were not on Phe-restricted diets. All patients received treatment with sapropterin dihydrochloride 10 mg/kg per day for 8 days. For the purposes of this study, response to sapropterin dihydrochloride treatment was defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in blood Phe from baseline. At Day 8, 96 patients (20%) were identified as responders.</p><p>Study 2 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 88 patients with PKU who responded to sapropterin dihydrochloride in Study 1. After a washout period from Study 1, patients were randomized equally to either sapropterin dihydrochloride 10 mg/kg per day (N=41) or placebo (N=47) for 6 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by the mean change in blood Phe level from baseline to Week 6 in the sapropterin dihydrochloride-treated group as compared to the mean change in the placebo group.</p><p>The results showed that at baseline, the mean (±SD) blood Phe level was 843 (±300) μmol/L in the sapropterin dihydrochloride-treated group and 888 (±323) μmol/L in the placebo group. At Week 6, the sapropterin dihydrochloride treated group had a mean (±SD) blood Phe level of 607 (±377) μmol/L, and the placebo group had a mean blood Phe level of 891 (±348) μmol/L. At Week 6, the sapropterin dihydrochloride- and placebo treated groups had mean changes in blood Phe level of –239 and 6 μmol/L, respectively (mean percent changes of –29% (±32) and 3% (±33), respectively).
