Insulin is one of many hormones that help the body turn the food we eat into energy. This is done by using the glucose (sugar) in the blood as quick energy. Also, insulin helps us store energy that we can use later. When you have diabetes mellitus, your body cannot make enough insulin or does not use insulin properly. This causes you to have too much sugar in your blood. Like other types of insulin, insulin human regular is used to keep your blood sugar level close to normal.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Humulin R U-100</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Humulin® R in children.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Humulin® R U-500 in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of insulin human regular have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of this medicine in the elderly.
