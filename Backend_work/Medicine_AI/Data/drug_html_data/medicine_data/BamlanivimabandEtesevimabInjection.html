</ul><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">The dosage of bamlanivimab and etesevimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) is:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>bamlanivimab 700 mg</li>
<li>etesevimab 1,400 mg.</li>
</ul><p>Administer bamlanivimab and etesevimab together as soon as possible after positive viral test for SARS-CoV-2 and within 10 days of symptom onset.</p><p>Under this EUA, bamlanivimab and etesevimab must be diluted and administered together as a single intravenous infusion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Rationale for Authorized Dosage</span></p><p>The dosage of 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1,400 mg etesevimab administered together was selected based on analyses of available data incorporating the following factors:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Available data demonstrate that a dosage of 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1,400 mg etesevimab administered together has similar antiviral activity to a dosage of 2,800 mg bamlanivimab and 2,800 mg etesevimab administered together, which is also supported by in vitro data and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) modeling <span class="Italics">[see Pharmacodynamics (14.2)]</span>.</li>
<li>A dosage of 2,800 mg bamlanivimab and 2,800 mg etesevimab administered together reduced COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths in addition to significantly reducing viral load relative to placebo <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>Bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together resulted in fewer treatment-emergent variants relative to bamlanivimab administered alone <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology/Resistance Information (15)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p>Based on analyses of the available nonclinical, clinical, and virologic data, as well as supportive data from pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, the authorized dosage of 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1,400 mg etesevimab is expected to have similar clinical effect to a dosage of 2,800 mg bamlanivimab and 2,800 mg etesevimab.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment in Specific Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy or Lactation</span></p><p>No dosage adjustment is recommended in pregnant or lactating women <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (11.1, 11.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p><p>No dosage adjustment is recommended in pediatric patients who weigh at least 40 kg and are 12 years of age and older.

Bamlanivimab and etesevimab should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.</p><p>Nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with bamlanivimab or etesevimab. In tissue cross reactivity studies using human fetal tissues, no binding of clinical concern was detected for etesevimab or bamlanivimab. Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, bamlanivimab and etesevimab have the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing fetus. It is unknown whether the potential transfer of bamlanivimab or etesevimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on the presence of bamlanivimab or etesevimab in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for bamlanivimab and etesevimab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from bamlanivimab and etesevimab or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together are being assessed in adolescent patients in ongoing clinical trials. The recommended dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of bamlanivimab and etesevimab in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg as observed in adults, based on a pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling approach which accounted for effect of body weight changes associated with age on clearance and volume of distribution.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 112 patients receiving bamlanivimab and etesevimab in BLAZE-1, 12% were 65 years of age and older and 2% were 75 years of age and older. Based on population PK analyses, there is no difference in PK of bamlanivimab or etesevimab in geriatric patients compared to younger patients.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are not eliminated intact in the urine, thus renal impairment is not expected to affect the exposure of bamlanivimab or etesevimab.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Based on population PK analysis, there is no difference in PK of bamlanivimab or etesevimab in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab have not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.</p><h3>Other Specific Populations</h3><p class="First">Based on population PK analysis, the PK of bamlanivimab and etesevimab was not affected by sex, race, or disease severity. Body weight had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of bamlanivimab and etesevimab in adults with COVID-19 over the body weight range of 41 kg to 173 kg.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Doses up to 7,000 mg of bamlanivimab (10 times the authorized dose of bamlanivimab) or 7,000 mg of etesevimab (5 times the authorized dose of etesevimab) have been administered in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. Treatment of overdose with bamlanivimab and etesevimab should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

Resistant variants were not identified when bamlanivimab and etesevimab were tested together using the same methodology. Viral variants identified in these studies that had reduced susceptibility to bamlanivimab included spike protein amino acid substitutions E484D/K/Q, F490S, Q493R, and S494P, and variants that had reduced susceptibility to etesevimab included substitutions K417N, D420N, and N460K/S/T. Neutralization assays using SARS-CoV-2, vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudovirus, or binding assessment if pseudovirus construction was unsuccessful (E484D), confirmed reductions in susceptibility to the selecting antibody. Retention of susceptibility to the other antibody alone was observed, with the exception of the Q493R substitution. All variants maintained susceptibility to bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, with the exception of those with E484K, E484Q, and Q493R substitutions, which had reduced susceptibility of 15-fold, 22-fold, and &gt;100-fold, respectively in a pseudovirus assay.</p><p>Evaluation of susceptibility of variants identified through global surveillance in subjects treated with bamlanivimab and etesevimab is ongoing. Pseudoviral evaluation of amino acid substitutions identified in global surveillance showed that the V483A substitution reduced susceptibility to bamlanivimab 48-fold, but activity was maintained with etesevimab, and with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. N501Y and N501T substitutions reduced susceptibility to etesevimab approximately 5-fold and 20-fold, respectively. Activity against variants with N501Y or N501T substitutions was maintained with bamlanivimab alone, and with bamlanivimab and etesevimab together. Pseudovirus harboring spike substitutions K417N + E484K + N501Y together had reduced susceptibility to bamlanivimab or etesevimab alone of &gt;60-fold and &gt;23-fold, respectively, indicating that bamlanivimab and etesevimab together are likely to have reduced activity against viral variants harboring these concurrent substitutions, such as those from B.1.351 (South African origin). Studies are in process to test the activity of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together against additional pseudoviruses and viral variants from this lineage and the related P.1 (Brazilian origin) lineage. Bamlanivimab alone and bamlanivimab and etesevimab together retained activity against pseudovirus expressing del69-70 + N501Y found in the B.1.1.7 variant (UK origin).</p><p>Genotypic and phenotypic testing are ongoing to monitor for potential bamlanivimab- and etesevimab-resistance associated spike variations in clinical trials. Detection of phenotypically confirmed bamlanivimab- or etesevimab-resistant variants in baseline samples were observed at a frequency of 0% (0/14) in the Phase 1 clinical study PYAA and 0.4% (2/523) in clinical study BLAZE-1.</p><p>In BLAZE-1, treatment-emergent variants were detected at spike protein amino acid positions K417, D420, N460, E484, F490 and S494, and included K417N, D420N, N460T, E484A/D/G/K/Q/V, F490L/S/V and S494L/P substitutions. Only K417N, D420N, N460T, E484D/K/Q, F490S and S494P have been assessed phenotypically to date.

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of Bamlanivimab and Etesevimab for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)</span></p><p>You are being given two medicines together called <span class="Bold">bamlanivimab and etesevimab</span> for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This Fact Sheet contains information to help you understand the potential risks and potential benefits of taking bamlanivimab and etesevimab, which you may receive.</p><p>Receiving bamlanivimab and etesevimab together may benefit certain people with COVID-19.</p><p>Read this Fact Sheet for information about bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions. It is your choice to receive bamlanivimab and etesevimab or stop them at any time.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is COVID-19?</span></p><p>COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. People can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.</p><p>COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</span></p><p>The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness including breathing problems can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are bamlanivimab and etesevimab?</span></p><p>Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are investigational medicines used to treat mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg)), and who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms or the need for hospitalization. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are investigational because they are still being studied. There is limited information known about the safety or effectiveness of using bamlanivimab and etesevimab to treat people with COVID-19.</p><p>The FDA has authorized the emergency use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together for the treatment of COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). For more information on EUA, see the section “<span class="Bold">What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?</span>” at the end of this Fact Sheet.</p><p><span class="Bold">What should I tell my healthcare provider before I receive bamlanivimab and etesevimab?</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</span></p><ul class="Disc">

<li>Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant</li>
<li>Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed</li>
<li>Have any serious illnesses</li>
<li>Are taking any medications (prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, and herbal products)</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">How will I receive bamlanivimab and etesevimab?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are given to you at the same time through a vein (intravenous or IV).</li>
<li>You will receive one dose of bamlanivimab and etesevimab by IV infusion. The infusion will take 21 – 60 minutes or longer. Your healthcare provider will determine the duration of your infusion.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">What are the important possible side effects of bamlanivimab and etesevimab?</span></p><p>Possible side effects of bamlanivimab and etesevimab are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can happen during and after infusion with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of allergic reactions: fever, chills, nausea, headache, shortness of breath, low or high blood pressure, rapid or slow heart rate, chest discomfort or pain, weakness, confusion, feeling tired, wheezing, swelling of your lips, face, or throat, rash including hives, itching, muscle aches, dizziness, and sweating. These reactions may be severe or life threatening.</li>
<li>Worsening symptoms after treatment: You may experience new or worsening symptoms after infusion, including fever, difficulty breathing, rapid or slow heart rate, tiredness, weakness or confusion. If these occur, contact your healthcare provider or seek immediate medical attention as some of these events have required hospitalization. It is unknown if these events are related to treatment or are due to the progression of COVID-19.</li>
</ul><p>The side effects of getting any medicine by vein may include brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the infusion site.</p><p>These are not all the possible side effects of bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Not a lot of people have been given bamlanivimab and etesevimab. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time.</p><p>It is possible that bamlanivimab and etesevimab could interfere with your body's own ability to fight off a future infection of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, bamlanivimab and etesevimab may reduce your body's immune response to a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Specific studies have not been conducted to address these possible risks. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions.</p><p><span class="Bold">What other treatment choices are there?</span></p><p>Like bamlanivimab and etesevimab, FDA may allow for the emergency use of other medicines to treat people with COVID-19. Go to <span class="Bold">https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/</span> for information on the emergency use of other medicines that are not approved by FDA to treat people with COVID-19.

</ul><p><span class="Bold">What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?</span></p><p>The United States FDA has made bamlanivimab and etesevimab available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Bamlanivimab and etesevimab have not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The EUA for bamlanivimab and etesevimab together is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of these products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the product may no longer be used).</p><p>Literature issued February 9, 2021</p><p><span class="Bold">Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA<br/></span> Copyright © 2021, Eli Lilly and Company.
