</ul><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Scientific Name(s):</b> Althaea officinalis L.<br/><b>Common Name(s):</b> Althea, Altheae radix, Mallards, Marshmallow, Mauls, Schloss tea, White mallow</p><h2>Clinical Overview</h2><h3>Use</h3><p>A. officinalis has been traditionally used for cough, inflammation of the mouth and stomach, and peptic ulcers. It appears to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties and may be used topically to increase epithelialization of wounds. However, there are no recent clinical trials to support these uses.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>Root: 6 g/day.</p><p>Leaf: 10 g/day.</p><p>Marshmallow syrup: 10 g/day.</p><p>Topical: 5 to 10 g in an ointment or cream base or 5% powdered marshmallow leaf applied 3 times daily.</p><p>Gargle: 2 g soaked in 240 mL of cold water for 2 hours then gargled. Hot water should not be used.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications have not been identified.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>Oral medications: When taken with other oral medications, marshmallow may delay the absorption of the other medications.</p><p>Oral hypoglycemic agents/Insulin: Due to potential additive hypoglycemic effects, marshmallow should be used cautiously in patients receiving oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin.</p><p>Topical corticosteroids: Marshmallow may enhance the effects of topical corticosteroids. Use caution.</p><p>Aminoglycosides: Use caution or avoid use of marshmallow in patients receiving aminoglycosides such as gentamicin.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests potential allergic reactions and hypoglycemia.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>The acute median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of A. officinalis in mice was greater than 5,000 mg/kg.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Malvaceae (mallow)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>Marshmallow is a perennial plant that grows up to 1.5 m in height in salt marshes and moist regions throughout Europe, western and northern Asia, and the eastern United States. Its flowers are pink and the 3-lobed leaves are velvety due to a dense covering of hair. The plant blooms from July to September and resembles hollyhock (Althaea rosea). Marshmallow root is collected in the fall from a plant that is at least 2 years old, and is then peeled of its brown corky layer, dried, and used in commerce.</p><p>The Malvaceae family is known as the mallow family, and confusion may surround the common nomenclature and identification of plants in this group. A. officinalis should not be confused with confectionary marshmallows, which were once made from A. officinalis but currently consist mostly of sugar.1</p><h2>History</h2><p>Marshmallow root has traditionally been recognized as a source of mucilage, which has been used for more than 2 millennia to treat topical wounds and as a remedy for sore throats, cough, and stomach ailments. The first recorded therapeutic use of marshmallow was in the ninth century BC.2 The mucilage is incorporated into ointments to soothe chapped skin and is added to foods in small quantities (approximately 20 ppm) to provide bulk and texture.3 One report discusses althea-type plants at a Neanderthal gravesite in Iraq.4 Marshmallow has also been used ritualistically to treat impotence; seeds are harvested under a full moon and made into an oil that is applied to the genitalia.1</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Marshmallow root and leaves contain mucilage polysaccharides (6.2% to 11.6% and 6% to 9%, respectively).2 The mucilage content varies considerably with the season and is highest in the winter. A purified mucilage is composed of L-rhamnose:D-galactose:D-galacturonic acid:D-glucuronic acid in a molar ratio of 3:2:3:3.3 Asparagine (2%), sugars, pectin, and a tannin have also been identified in the root.5, 6 Fatty oil of althea has been addressed.7 Flavonoid compounds of the leaves, flowers, and roots have also been described, including glucosidoesters and monoglucosides.8, 9 According to one study, flavonoid content of the white flowers of A. officinalis is higher than that of the pink and reddish-pink flowers. However, the reddish-pink flowers possess higher antioxidant activity than the white or pink flowers.10</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Dermatologic conditions</h3><p>The mucilaginous properties of althea root allow for the formation of a protective film over inflamed areas to help minimize inflammation.11 Combinations of althea extracts with steroids have been used in the management of dermatologic conditions,12, 13 and the plant appears to possess anti-inflammatory activity that potentiates the effect of topical steroids.14</p><p>In an in vitro study, A. officinalis protected against ultraviolet A (UVA) light–induced oxidative stress in skin fibroblasts. However, no reduction in DNA damage was noted with ultraviolet B (UVB) light irradiation. Thus, marshmallow might be useful in skin preparations that protect against UVA.15 In a murine model of wound excision creation, A. officinalis extract promoted epithelialization at a faster rate than was observed in the group that received no treatment; there were no differences between the A. officinalis group and the group treated with zinc oxide.16 In another study, topical use of an ointment containing A. officinalis extract increased wound healing in rabbits.17</p><p>A clinical trial evaluated the effects of a topical product containing A. officinalis, A. rosea (hollyhock), and other herbals for the treatment of leishmania lesions. Among patients receiving the topical herbal extract (n=86), a complete cure occurred in 74.4%, a partial cure occurred in 11.6%, and treatment failure occurred in 14%. Among those receiving the standard treatment of meglumine antimoniate injection, 24.1% experienced complete cure, 14.1% experienced partial cure, and 58.8% experienced treatment failure.18</p><h3>Antiulcerogenic effects</h3><p>Marshmallow is possibly beneficial in providing gastroprotection from ulcers due to its mucilaginous properties and flavonoid content, which offers coverage and protection of the GI tract.19</p><p>In a murine model, rats with ethanol-induced ulcers showed greater gastric protection with administration of A. officinalis 250 mg/kg than with control (cimetidine) (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05).20 In another murine model, marshmallow did not impact the quantity of ulcers or the ulcer index following administration of indomethacin; however, it did increase histamine release.19</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of marshmallow for the treatment of ulcers.</p><h3>Antitussive effects</h3><p>The polysaccharides in A. officinalis are believed to exert antitussive effects via formation of a protective film on the oropharyngeal mucosa. A model of lozenges containing marshmallow has been evaluated.21</p><p>In a study of cats, an A. officinalis polysaccharide dose of 50 mg/kg exerted cough-suppressing effects. An extract of marshmallow was less effective than the polysaccharide.22 In a model of airway inflammation in guinea pigs, the polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan from A. officinalis exerted cough-suppressing effects in a dose-dependent fashion.23 In another study of guinea pigs, it was theorized that rhamnogalacturonan's antitussive effects might be attributed to its association with 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 (5-HT<sub>2</sub>)receptors.24 In vitro, althea reduced the transport velocity of isolated ciliated epithelium cells of the frog esophagus. Additionally, marshmallow may be useful in the management of cough and cold because of its ability to protect mucosal layers in the hypopharynx, and because of its spasmolytic, antisecretory, and bactericidal activity.25</p><p>In a clinical study, 60 patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor–induced cough were randomized to receive A. officinalis 40 mg (given as 20 drops) or placebo every 8 hours for 4 weeks. At the end of the study, patients receiving A. officinalis had significantly lower cough scores compared with baseline (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). No significant changes were noted in the placebo group. Eight patients in the A. officinalis arm experienced almost complete resolution of cough.26</p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p>In a murine model, a polysaccharide from A. officinalis reduced blood glucose levels.27 This may be attributed to the high pectin content in althea.1</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of marshmallow in diabetes.</p><h3>Antimicrobial effects</h3><p>In a murine model of wound excision creation, A. officinalis extract demonstrated antibacterial activity against the gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus, but did not demonstrate activity against gram-negative organisms.16 In an in vitro study, A. officinalis exerted antimicrobial activity against numerous periodontopathic bacterial strains. In general, the methanolic extract exerted better antibacterial activity than the decoctions, suggesting a potential role in the management of patients with periodontitis.28 In another in vitro study, A. officinalis demonstrated antibacterial effects against methicillin-resistant S. aureus.29</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of marshmallow for its antimicrobial effects.</p><h3>Neuroprotective effects</h3><p>In a study of rats with induced hemi-Parkinsonism, an A. officinalis 10 mg/kg extract exerted neuroprotective effects.30</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of marshmallow for its neuroprotective effects.</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>Effects of varying doses of A. officinalis on lipid parameters, platelet aggregation, inflammation, and gastric ulcers were assessed in rats. Following 1 month of administration, A. officinalis did not reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triacylglycerol concentrations; however, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were improved with the 50 mg/kg dose. Time-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation was demonstrated with A. officinalis. Improvements in inflammation were noted in both the acute and chronic inflammation models, with an apparent optimal dose of 250 mg/kg to exert these anti-inflammatory effects.20</p><h2>Dosing</h2><h3>Root</h3><p>6 g/day.1, 11</p><h3>Leaf</h3><p>10 g/day.1, 11</p><h3>Marshmallow syrup</h3><p>10 g/day.1, 11</p><h3>Topical</h3><p>5 to 10 g in ointment or cream base or 5% powdered marshmallow leaf applied 3 times daily.1, 11</p><h3>Gargle</h3><p>2 g soaked in 240 mL of cold water for 2 hours then gargled. Hot water should not be used.1, 11</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><h3>Oral medications</h3><p>When taken with other oral medications, marshmallow may delay the absorption of the other medications.1, 2</p><h3>Oral hypoglycemic agents/Insulin</h3><p>Due to potential additive hypoglycemic effects, marshmallow should be used cautiously in patients receiving oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin.1</p><h3>Topical corticosteroids</h3><p>Marshmallow may enhance the effects of topical corticosteroids. Use caution.1</p><h3>Aminoglycosides</h3><p>Use caution or avoid use of marshmallow in individuals receiving aminoglycosides such as gentamicin. A. officinalis extract at varying doses did not exert renal protective effects against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity; higher doses of the extract actually worsened renal dysfunction.31</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests potential allergic reactions and hypoglycemia.1</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>The acute LD<sub>50</sub> of A. officinalis in mice was greater than 5,000 mg/kg.21</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
