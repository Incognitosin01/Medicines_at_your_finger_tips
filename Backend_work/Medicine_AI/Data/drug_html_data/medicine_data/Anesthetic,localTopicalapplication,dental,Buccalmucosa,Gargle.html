<li>Side effects</li></ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Dental anesthetics are used in the mouth to relieve pain or irritation caused by many conditions. Examples include toothache, teething, and sores in or around the mouth, such as cold sores, canker sores, and fever blisters. Also, some of these medicines are used to relieve pain or irritation caused by dentures or other dental appliances, including braces. However, if you have an infection or a lot of large sores in your mouth, check with your medical doctor or dentist before using a dental anesthetic because other kinds of treatment may be needed. Also, the chance of side effects is increased.</p><p>One form of lidocaine is also used to relieve pain caused by certain throat conditions. Some forms of benzocaine, benzocaine and menthol combination, and dyclonine are also used to relieve sore throat pain.</p><p>Some of these medicines are available only with your medical doctor's or dentist's prescription. Others are available without a prescription; however, your medical doctor or dentist may have special instructions on the proper use and dose for your medical problem. Some nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) aerosols, gels, liquids, or ointments that contain a local anesthetic are not meant to be used in or around the mouth. If you have any questions about which product to use, check with your pharmacist.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Children may be especially sensitive to the effects of dental anesthetics. This may increase the chance of unwanted effects, some of which can be serious, during treatment. When using a dental anesthetic for a child, be very careful not to use more of the medicine than directed on the label, unless otherwise directed by your health care professional. Teething medicines that contain benzocaine may be used in babies 4 months of age and older. One product that contains benzocaine (Orabase-B with Benzocaine) may be used in children 6 years of age and older. Most of the other nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines that contain a dental anesthetic may be used in children 2 years of age and older. However, these other nonprescription products should not be used in infants or children younger than 2 years of age unless prescribed by a health care professional.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Elderly people are especially sensitive to the effects of many local anesthetics. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment, especially with lidocaine. Nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) products containing local anesthetics are not likely to cause problems. However, elderly people should be especially careful not to use more medicine than directed on the package label, unless otherwise directed by a medical doctor or a dentist.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Dental anesthetics have not been reported to cause birth defects or other problems in humans.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Dental anesthetics have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p>For safe and effective use of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>Follow your medical doctor's or dentist's instructions if this medicine was prescribed.</li>
<li>Follow the manufacturer's package directions if you are treating yourself.</li>
<li>Do not use more of this medicine, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than directed. To do so may increase the chance of absorption into the body and the risk of side effects. This is particularly important for young children and elderly patients, especially with lidocaine.</li>
<li>Dental anesthetics should be used only for conditions being treated by your medical doctor or dentist or for problems listed in the package directions. Do not use any of them for other problems without first checking with your medical doctor or dentist. These medicines should not be used if certain kinds of infections are present.</li>
</ul><p>To use <i>the viscous (very thick) liquid form of lidocaine</i> (e.g., Xylocaine Viscous):</p><ul>
<li>This medicine may cause serious side effects if too much of it is swallowed. Be certain that you understand exactly how you are to use this medicine, and whether or not you are to swallow it. Follow your medical doctor's or dentist's directions very carefully. Also, be very careful to measure the exact amount of medicine that you are to use. Use a special measuring spoon to measure the amount; regular household teaspoons or soup spoons that you use at the table may not measure the amount correctly. These measures are especially important when this medicine is used for young children, who are especially sensitive to its effects.</li>
<li>If you are using this medicine for a problem in the mouth, you may apply it to the sore places with a cotton-tipped applicator. Or, you may swish the measured amount of medicine around in your mouth until you are certain that it has reached all of the sore places. Do not swallow the medicine unless your medical doctor or dentist has told you to do so.</li>
<li>If you are using this medicine for a problem in the throat, gargle with the measured amount of medicine as directed by your doctor. Do not swallow the medicine unless your doctor has told you to do so.</li>
</ul><p>To use <i>benzocaine film-forming gel</i> (e.g., Oratect Gel):</p><ul>
<li>Children may find it difficult to apply this medicine correctly. They should be helped by an adult.</li>
<li>First, dry the area where the medicine is needed, using a swab included in the package.</li>
<li>Apply the gel to a second swab. Then roll the swab over the dried area.</li>
<li>Keep your mouth open and dry for about 30 to 60 seconds after applying the medicine. A film will form where you placed the medicine.</li>
<li>Do not remove the film. It will slowly disappear and should be gone about 6 hours after the medicine was applied.</li>
</ul><p>To use <i>other gel or liquid forms of a dental anesthetic</i> :</p><ul>
<li>Apply the medicine to the sore places with a clean finger, a cotton-tipped applicator, or a piece of gauze.</li>
<li>When relieving pain caused by dentures or other dental appliances, do not apply this medicine directly to the appliance, and do not place the appliance in your mouth while the medicine is there, unless directed to do so by your dentist. Instead, apply the medicine to the sore areas in your mouth and wait until the pain is relieved. Then rinse your mouth with water before replacing the appliance.</li>
</ul><p>To use <i>benzocaine dental paste</i> (e.g., Orabase-B with Benzocaine):</p><ul>
<li>Use a cotton-tipped applicator to dab small amounts of the medicine onto the sore places. Do not rub or try to spread the medicine with your finger while you are applying it, because the medicine will become crumbly and gritty.</li>
</ul><p>To use <i>aerosol or spray forms of a dental anesthetic</i> :</p><ul>
<li>To help prevent unwanted effects, be very careful not to inhale (breathe in) the medicine. Also, do not spray the back of your mouth or throat with it unless your medical doctor or dentist directs you to do so.</li>
</ul><p>To use <i>lozenge forms of benzocaine, benzocaine and menthol, or dyclonine</i>:</p><ul>
<li>These lozenges should be dissolved slowly in the mouth. Do not bite or chew them or swallow them whole. Before giving a lozenge to a young child, be sure that the child understands these directions and will follow them.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
