Specifically, the risk of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions may be increased. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%: Nervous system: Headache (2% to 14%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Cardiovascular: Flushing (≤1%)</p><p>Dermatologic: Skin rash (≤5%), erythema of skin (2%), pruritus (2%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Vomiting (3% to 5%), nausea (≤5%), abdominal pain (3% to 4%), dysgeusia (1%)</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reaction (≤4%)</p><p>Local: Injection site reaction (1% to 3%)</p><p>Nervous system: Insomnia (2% to 3%), dizziness (1% to 2%)</p><p>Respiratory: Cough (7% to 8%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (5% to 9%)</p><p>&lt;1%: Acute pancreatitis, antibody development, diarrhea</p><p>Frequency not defined: Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitivity reaction</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Antibody formation: Formation of antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII may occur; monitor patients for the development of antibodies by clinical observation and laboratory tests. Suspect factor VIII antibodies if the plasma factor VIII level does not increase as expected or if bleeding is not controlled after administration.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: May occur, including severe reactions. Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions; discontinue immediately if allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions occur.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Mouse/hamster protein: Products may contain trace amounts of mouse or hamster protein.</p><p>• Polyethylene glycol: Products contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). A clinical immune response associated with IgM anti-PEG antibodies, manifested as symptoms of acute hypersensitivity and/or loss of drug effect, has been observed (primarily in patients &lt;6 years of age) with Jivi. In case of clinical suspicion of loss of drug effect, test for factor VIII inhibitors and factor VIII recovery. A low postinfusion factor VIII level in the absence of detectable factor VIII inhibitors likely indicates anti-PEG antibodies; discontinue Jivi and switch patients to a previously effective factor VIII product. A similar clinical immune response has not been observed with Adynovate or Esperoct.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: May contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Dose requirements: The dosage requirement will vary in patients with factor VIII inhibitors; optimal treatment should be determined by clinical response.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Hypersensitivity reactions, heart rate and blood pressure (before and during IV administration); plasma factor VIII activity prior to and during treatment (to confirm adequate factor VIII levels have been achieved and maintained); development of factor VIII inhibitors using the Bethesda inhibitor assay; signs of bleeding; hemoglobin, hematocrit.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Pregnant hemophilia A carriers may have an increased bleeding risk following abortion, invasive procedures, miscarriage, and delivery; close surveillance is recommended. Factor VIII levels should be monitored at the first antenatal visit, once or twice during the third trimester, prior to surgical or invasive procedures, and at delivery. Although factor VIII concentrations increase in pregnant patients, factor VIII replacement is recommended if concentrations are &lt;0.5 IU/mL and any of the following occur: need for invasive procedures (including delivery), spontaneous miscarriage, insertion and removal of epidural catheters, or active bleeding. Hemostatic factor VIII concentrations should be maintained for at least 3 to 5 days following invasive procedures or postpartum. If a replacement product is indicated, a recombinant product is preferred (NHF 2017; RCOG [Pavord 2017]; WFH [Srivastava 2013]). Initial reports using the recombinant pegylated product have been limited to use in males (Brand 2016; Dunn 2018; Konkle 2015).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat hemophilia.</p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent bleeding.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
