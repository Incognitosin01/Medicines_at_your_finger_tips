Amlodipine relaxes (widens) blood vessels and improves blood flow.</p><p>Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Telmisartan keeps blood vessels from narrowing, which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow.</p><p>Twynsta is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use Twynsta if you are pregnant.
