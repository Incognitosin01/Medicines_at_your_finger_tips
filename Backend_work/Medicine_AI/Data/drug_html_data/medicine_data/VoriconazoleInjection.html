<br/>
<span class="Bold">Administer diluted voriconazole for injection I.V. by intravenous infusion over 1 to 2 hours only. Do not administer as an IV bolus injection.</span></p><h3>Use of voriconazole for injection I.V. With Other Parenteral Drug Products</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Blood  products and concentrated electrolytes</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Voriconazole for injection I.V. must not be infused concomitantly with any blood product or short-term infusion of concentrated electrolytes, even if the two infusions are running in separate intravenous lines (or cannulas).</span> Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole for injection therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Intravenous solutions containing (non-concentrated) electrolytes</span><br/>
Voriconazole for injection I.V. can be infused at the same time as other intravenous solutions containing (non-concentrated) electrolytes, but must be infused through a separate line.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)</span><br/>
Voriconazole for injection I.V. can be infused at the same time as total parenteral nutrition, but must be infused in a separate line. If infused through a multiple-lumen catheter, TPN needs to be administered using a different port from the one used for voriconazole for injection I.V.</p><h3>Recommended Dosing in Adults</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Invasive aspergillosis and serious fungal infections due to <span class="Italics">Fusarium spp</span>. and <span class="Italics">Scedosporium apiospermum</span></span></p><p>See Table 1. Therapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of intravenous voriconazole for injection I.V on Day 1 followed by the recommended maintenance dose (RMD) regimen. Intravenous treatment should be continued for at least 7 days. Once the patient has clinically improved and can tolerate medication given by mouth, the oral tablet form or oral suspension form of voriconazole for injection may be utilized. The recommended oral maintenance dose of 200 mg achieves a voriconazole exposure similar to 3 mg/kg intravenously; a 300 mg oral dose achieves an exposure similar to 4 mg/kg intravenously. Switching between the intravenous and oral formulations is appropriate because of the high bioavailability of the oral formulation in adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].</p><p><span class="Bold">Candidemia in non-neutropenic patients and other deep tissue Candida infections</span></p><p>See Table 1. Patients should be treated for at least 14 days following resolution of symptoms or following last positive culture, whichever is longer.</p><p><span class="Bold">Esophageal Candidiasis</span></p><p>See Table 1. Patients should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and for at least 7 days following resolution of symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Recommended Dosing Regimen (Adults)</span></p><p><span class="Sup">a </span>Increase dose when voriconazole for injection is co-administered with phenytoin or efavirenz (7); Decrease dose in patients with hepatic impairment (2.5)<br/>
<span class="Sup">b</span> In healthy volunteer studies, the 200 mg oral every 12 hours dose provided an exposure (AUCτ) similar to a 3 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 12 hours dose; the 300 mg oral every 12 hours dose provided an exposure (AUCτ) similar to a 4 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 12 hours dose (12).<br/>
<span class="Sup">c</span> Adult patients who weigh less than 40 kg should receive half of the oral maintenance dose.<br/>
<span class="Sup">d </span>In a clinical study of IA, the median duration of intravenous voriconazole therapy was 10 days (range 2 to 85 days). The median duration of oral voriconazole for injection therapy was 76 days (range 2 to 232 days) (14.1).<br/>
<span class="Sup">e</span> In clinical trials, patients with candidemia received 3 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 12 hours as primary therapy, while patients with other deep tissue Candida infections received 4 mg/kg every 12 hours as salvage therapy. Appropriate dose should be based on the severity and nature of the infection.<br/>
<span class="Sup">f</span> Not evaluated in patients with EC.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Method for Adjusting the Dosing Regimen in Adults</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If patient’s response is inadequate, the oral maintenance dose may be increased from 200 mg every 12 hours (similar to 3 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours) to 300 mg every 12 hours (similar to 4 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours). For adult patients weighing less than 40 kg, the oral maintenance dose may be increased from 100 mg every 12 hours to 150 mg every 12 hours. If patient is unable to tolerate 300 mg orally every 12 hours, reduce the oral maintenance dose by 50 mg steps to a minimum of 200 mg every 12 hours (or to 100 mg every 12 hours for adult patients weighing less than 40 kg).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If patient is unable to tolerate 4 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours, reduce the intravenous maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg every 12 hours.</p><h3>Recommended Dosing Regimen in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">For pediatric patients 12 to 14 years of age with a body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and those 15 years of age and above regardless of body weight, administer the adult dosing regimen of voriconazole for injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Initiate therapy with an intravenous infusion regimen. Consider an oral regimen only after there is a significant clinical improvement.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Method for Adjusting the Dosing Regimen in Pediatric Patients: </span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pediatric patients 12 to 14 years of age weighing greater than or equal to 50kg and 15 years of age and older regardless of body weight: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Use the optimal method for titrating dosage recommended for adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Additional pediatric use information is approved for PF PRISM C.V.’s VFEND (voriconazole). However, due to PF PRISM C.V.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</span></p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients With Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The maintenance dose of voriconazole should be reduced in adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh Class A and B. There are no PK data to allow for dosage adjustment recommendations in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Duration of therapy should be based on the severity of the patient’s underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Adult patients with baseline liver function tests (ALT, AST) of up to 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were included in the clinical program. Dose adjustments are not necessary for adult patients with this degree of abnormal liver function, but continued monitoring of liver function tests for further elevations is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is recommended that the recommended voriconazole loading dose regimens be used, but that the maintenance dose be halved in adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A and B) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole has not been studied in adult patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) or in patients with chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C disease. Voriconazole has been associated with elevations in liver function tests and with clinical signs of liver damage, such as jaundice. Voriconazole should only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Patients with hepatic impairment must be carefully monitored for drug toxicity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dosage adjustment of voriconazole in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment has not been established <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span> .</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients With Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The pharmacokinetics of orally administered voriconazole are not significantly affected by renal impairment. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing in patients with mild to severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min) who are receiving an intravenous infusion of voriconazole for injection, accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. Oral voriconazole should be administered to these patients, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of intravenous voriconazole for injection. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients, and, if increases occur, consideration should be given to changing to oral voriconazole therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Voriconazole is hemodialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. A 4-hour hemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dosage adjustment of voriconazole in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span> .</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment When Co-Administered With Phenytoin or Efavirenz</h3><p class="First">The maintenance dose of voriconazole should be increased when co-administered with phenytoin or efavirenz. Use the optimal method for titrating dosage <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Preparation and Intravenous Administration of Voriconazole for Injection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reconstitution</span><br/>
<br/>
The powder is reconstituted with 19 mL of Water For Injection to obtain an extractable volume of 20 mL of clear concentrate containing 10 mg/mL of voriconazole. It is recommended that a standard 20 mL (non-automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount (19.0 mL) of Water for Injection is dispensed. Discard the vial if a vacuum does not pull the diluent into the vial. Shake the vial until all the powder is dissolved.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Dilution</span><br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection must be infused over 1 to 3 hours, at a concentration of 5 mg/mL or less. Therefore, the required volume of the 10 mg/mL voriconazole for injection concentrate should be further diluted as follows (appropriate diluents listed below):<br/>
<br/>
1. Calculate the volume of 10 mg/mL voriconazole for injection concentrate required based on the patient’s weight (see Table 3).<br/>
2. In order to allow the required volume of voriconazole for injection concentrate to be added, withdraw and discard at least an equal volume of diluent from the infusion bag or bottle to be used. The volume of diluent remaining in the bag or bottle should be such that when the 10 mg/mL voriconazole for injection concentrate is added, the final concentration is not less than 0.5 mg/mL nor greater than 5 mg/mL.<br/>
3. Using a suitable size syringe and aseptic technique, withdraw the required volume of voriconazole for injection concentrate from the appropriate number of vials and add to the infusion bag or bottle. <span class="Bold">Discard Partially Used Vials.</span><br/>
The final voriconazole for injection solution must be infused over 1 to 3 hours at a maximum rate of 3 mg/kg per hour.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Table 3:<br/>
Required Volumes of 10 mg/mL Voriconazole for injection Concentrate</p><p>Voriconazole for injection I.V. is a single-dose unpreserved sterile lyophile. Therefore, from a microbiological point of view, once reconstituted, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). This medicinal product is for single use only and any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solutions without particles should be used.</p><p>The reconstituted solution can be diluted with:<br/>

<br/>
The compatibility of voriconazole for injection I.V. with diluents other than those described above is unknown (see Incompatibilities below).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Incompatibilities<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection I.V. must not be diluted with 4.2% Sodium Bicarbonate Infusion. The mildly alkaline nature of this diluent caused slight degradation of voriconazole for injection after 24 hours storage at room temperature. Although refrigerated storage is recommended following reconstitution, use of this diluent is not recommended as a precautionary measure. Compatibility with other concentrations is unknown.<br/>

However, due to PF PRISM C.V.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</span></p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Powder for Solution for Injection</span><br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection I.V. is supplied in a single-dose vial as a sterile lyophilized powder equivalent to 200 mg voriconazole and 3,200 mg sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin sodium (SBECD).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">• Voriconazole for injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients. There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between voriconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing voriconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.<br/>
• Coadministration of cisapride, pimozide or quinidine with voriconazole for injection is contraindicated because increased plasma concentrations of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
• Coadministration of voriconazole for injection with sirolimus is contraindicated because voriconazole for injection significantly increases sirolimus concentrations <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
• Coadministration of voriconazole for injection with rifampin, carbamazepine and long-acting barbiturates is contraindicated because these drugs are likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
• Coadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg every 24 hours or higher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
• Coadministration of voriconazole for injection with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations. Coadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg every 12 hours) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
• Coadministration of voriconazole for injection with rifabutin is contraindicated since voriconazole for injection significantly increases rifabutin plasma concentrations and rifabutin also significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
• Coadministration of voriconazole for injection with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) is contraindicated because voriconazole for injection may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids, which may lead to ergotism <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .<br/>
• Coadministration of voriconazole for injection with St. John’s Wort is contraindicated because this herbal supplement may decrease voriconazole plasma concentration <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hepatic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole for injection (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
A higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the pediatric population <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> .Hepatic function should be monitored in both adult and pediatric patients. </p><p>Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole for injection therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole for injection should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit/risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use <span class="Italics">[see  Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> . </p><h3>Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Some azoles, including voriconazole for injection, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory.<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as:<br/>
<br/>
• Congenital or acquired QT prolongation<br/>
• Cardiomyopathy, in particular when heart failure is present<br/>
• Sinus bradycardia<br/>
• Existing symptomatic arrhythmias<br/>
• Concomitant medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span><br/>
<br/>
Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Infusion Related Reactions</h3><p class="First">During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole for injection in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash, have occurred uncommonly. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion. Consideration should be given to stopping the infusion should these reactions occur.</p><h3>Visual Disturbances</h3><p class="First">The effect of voriconazole for injection on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field, and color perception should be monitored <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Serious Exfoliative Cutaneous Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole for injection. If a patient develops an exfoliative cutaneous reaction, voriconazole for injection should be discontinued.</p><h3>Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole for injection has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including pediatric patients, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole for injection treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole for injection discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole for injection is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole for injection therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole for injection should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole for injection has been associated with photosensitivity related skin reactions such as pseudoporphyria, cheilitis, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole for injection therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. </p><h3>Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole for injection. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and may have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function.<br/>
<br/>
Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation of serum creatinine <span class="Italics">[see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span> .</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.<br/>
<br/>
In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with fetal malformations, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
If voriconazole for injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking voriconazole for injection, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with voriconazole for injection <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole for injection therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin).</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Pancreatitis has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole for injection <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span> Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole for injection treatment.</p><h3>Skeletal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole for injection therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole for injection should be discontinued <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Clinically Significant Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">See Table 10 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 11 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)and Drug Interactions (7)]</span> .</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:<br/>

<span class="Italics">Overview</span><br/>
<br/>
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (see Table 4) in the adult therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3.0%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The adverse reactions which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances <span class="Italics">[see Warning and Precautions (5.1, 5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
The data described in Table 4 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in nine therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non- neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non- therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11-90, including 51 patients aged 12-18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 4 includes all adverse reactions which were reported at an incidence of 2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of &lt;2%.<br/>
<br/>
In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy (OLAT) in the primary treatment of patients with acute IA. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse events was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of EC. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse events was 7% (14/200 patients). Laboratory test abnormalities for these studies are discussed under Clinical Laboratory Values below.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="Bold">Visual Disturbances</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection treatment-related visual disturbances are common. In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole for injection caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. These effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole for injection and continued through the course of study drug treatment. Fourteen days after the end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Dermatological Reactions</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dermatological reactions were common in patients treated with voriconazole for injection. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse events remains unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Serious cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme have been reported during treatment with voriconazole for injection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection has also been associated with additional photosensitivity related skin reactions such as pseudoporphyria, cheilitis, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Less Common Adverse Reactions</span><br/>

<span class="Bold">Clinical Laboratory Values in Adults</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The overall incidence of transaminase increases &gt;3x upper limit of normal (not necessarily comprising an adverse reaction) was 17.7% (268/1514) in adult subjects treated with voriconazole for injection for therapeutic use in pooled clinical trials. Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or resolved following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole for injection therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole for injection therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole for injection must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole for injection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole for injection. Patients being treated with voriconazole for injection are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and may have concurrent conditions that can result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation of serum creatinine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tables 5 to 7 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with EC were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable IA were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.<br/>

The safety of Voriconazole for injection was investigated in pediatric patients, including 52 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age who were enrolled in the adult therapeutic studies. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Hepatic-Related Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients </span><br/>

<br/>
The frequency of  hepatic-related adverse reactions in pediatric patients exposed to Voriconazole for injection in therapeutic studies was numerically higher than that of adults (28.6% compared to 24.1%, respectively).The higher frequency of hepatic adverse reactions in the pediatric population was mainly due to an increased frequency of liver enzyme elevations (21.9% in pediatric patients compared to 16.1% in adults), including transaminase elevations (ALT and AST combined) 7.6% in the pediatric patients compared to 5.1% in adults.<br/>

<br/>
Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of voriconazole in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral voriconazole was associated with fetal malformations in rats and fetal toxicity in rabbits. Cleft palates and hydronephrosis/hydroureter were observed in rat pups exposed to voriconazole during organogenesis at and above 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the RMD of 200 mg every 12 hours based on body surface area comparisons). In rabbits, embryomortality, reduced fetal weight and increased incidence of skeletal variations, cervical ribs and extrasternal ossification sites were observed in pups when pregnant rabbits were orally dosed at 100 mg/kg (6 times the RMD based on body surface area comparisons) during organogenesis. Rats exposed to voriconazole from implantation to weaning experienced increased gestational length and dystocia, which were associated with increased perinatal pup mortality at the 10 mg/kg dose <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20% respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole was administered orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis (gestation days 6-17) at 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day..Voriconazole was associated with increased incidences in hydroureter and hydronephrosis at 10 mg/kg/day or greater, approximately 0.3 times the recommended human dose (RMD) based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>, and cleft palate at 60 mg/kg, approximately 2 times the RMD based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>. Reduced ossification of sacral and caudal vertebrae, skull, pubic, and hyoid bone, supernumerary ribs, anomalies of the sternbrae, and dilatation of the ureter/renal pelvis were also observed at doses of 10 mg/kg or greater. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity at any dose.<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 7-19) at 10, 40, and 100 mg/kg/day. Voriconazole was associated with increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body weight, in association with maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain and food consumption) at 100 mg/kg/day (6 times the RMD based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>). Fetal skeletal variations (increases in the incidence of cervical rib and extra sternebral ossification sites) were observed at 100 mg/kg/day.<br/>
<br/>
In a peri- and postnatal toxicity study in rats, voriconazole was administered orally to female rats from implantation through the end of lactation at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day. Voriconazole prolonged the duration of gestation and labor and produced dystocia with related increases in maternal mortality and decreases in perinatal survival of F1 pups at 10 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3 times the RMD.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
<br/>
No data are available regarding the presence of voriconazole in human milk, the effects of voriconazole on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for voriconazole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from voriconazole or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception</span><br/>
<br/>
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with voriconazole for injection. The coadministration of voriconazole with the oral contraceptive, Ortho-Novum <span class="Sup">®</span> (35 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg norethindrone), results in an interaction between these two drugs, but is unlikely to reduce the contraceptive effect. Monitoring for adverse reactions associated with oral contraceptives and voriconazole is recommended <span class="Italics">[see  Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Voriconazole for injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 to 14 years weighing greater than or equal to 50 kg and those aged 15 years and older regardless of body weight based on evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adult and pediatric patients and additional pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety data. A total of 51 pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18[N=51] from eight adult therapeutic trials provided safety information for Voriconazole for injection use in the pediatric population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology(12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)]. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years has not been established. Therefore, Voriconazole for injection is not recommended for pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. <br/>
<br/>
A higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].<br/>
<br/>
The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Squamous cellcarcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions. Stringent measures for photo protection are warranted. Sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended in pediatric patients experiencing photo aging injuries, such as lentigines or ephelides, even after treatment discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. <br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection has not been studied in pediatric patients with hepatic or renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration(2.5, 2.6)]. Hepatic function and serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in pediatric patients [see  Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.9)]. <br/>
<br/>

However, due to PF PRISM C.V.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. </span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In multiple dose therapeutic trials of voriconazole, 9.2% of patients were ≥65 years of age and 1.8% of patients were ≥75 years of age. In a study in healthy subjects, the systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were increased in elderly males compared to young males. Pharmacokinetic data obtained from 552 patients from 10 voriconazole therapeutic trials showed that voriconazole plasma concentrations in the elderly patients were approximately 80% to 90% higher than those in younger patients after either IV or oral administration. However, the overall safety profile of the elderly patients was similar to that of the young so no dosage adjustment is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In clinical trials, there were three cases of accidental overdose. All occurred in pediatric patients who received up to five times the recommended intravenous dose of voriconazole. A single adverse event of photophobia of 10 minutes duration was reported.<br/>

Voriconazole for injection I.V. is a white lyophilized powder containing nominally 200 mg voriconazole and 3200 mg sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin sodium in a 30 mL Type I clear glass vial.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole for injection I.V. is intended for administration by intravenous infusion. It is a single-dose, unpreserved product. Vials containing 200 mg lyophilized voriconazole are intended for reconstitution with Water for Injection to produce a solution containing 10 mg/mL voriconazole for injection and 160 mg/mL of sulfobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrin sodium.

<br/>
In 10 clinical trials (N=1121), the median values for the average and maximum voriconazole plasma concentrations in individual patients across these studies was 2.51 µg/mL (inter-quartile range 1.21 to 4.44 µg/mL) and 3.79 µg/mL (inter-quartile range 2.06 to 6.31 µg/mL), respectively. A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of patient data from 6 of these 10 clinical trials (N=280) could not detect a positive association between mean, maximum or minimum plasma voriconazole concentration and efficacy.<br/>
<br/>
However, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of the data from all 10 clinical trials identified positive associations between plasma voriconazole concentrations and rate of both liver function test abnormalities and visual disturbances [see Adverse Reactions (6)].<br/>

A placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study to evaluate the effect on the QT interval of healthy male and female subjects was conducted with three single oral doses of voriconazole and ketoconazole. Serial ECGs and plasma samples were obtained at specified intervals over a 24-hour post dose observation period. The placebo-adjusted mean maximum increases in QTc from baseline after 800, 1200, and 1600 mg of voriconazole and after ketoconazole 800 mg were all &lt;10 msec. Females exhibited a greater increase in QTc than males, although all mean changes were &lt;10 msec. Age was not found to affect the magnitude of increase in QTc. No subject in any group had an increase in QTc of ≥60 msec from baseline. No subject experienced an interval exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. However, the QT effect of voriconazole combined with drugs known to prolong the QT interval is unknown <span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]</span> .</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole have been characterized in healthy subjects, special populations and patients.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are non-linear due to saturation of its metabolism. The interindividual variability of voriconazole pharmacokinetics is high. Greater than proportional increase in exposure is observed with increasing dose. It is estimated that, on average, increasing the oral dose from 200 mg every 12 hours to 300 mg every 12 hours leads to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in exposure (AUC); similarly, increasing the intravenous dose from 3 mg/kg every 12 hours to 4 mg/kg every 12 hours produces an approximately 2.5-fold increase in exposure (Table 12).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 12:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Geometric Mean (%CV) Plasma Voriconazole Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Adults Receiving Different Dosing Regimens<br/></span></p><p>Note: Parameters were estimated based on non-compartmental analysis from 5 pharmacokinetic studies.<br/>
AUC12 = area under the curve over 12 hour dosing interval, Cmax = maximum plasma concentration, Cmin = minimum plasma concentration. CV = coefficient of variation<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the recommended intravenous loading dose regimen is administered to healthy subjects, plasma concentrations close to steady state are achieved within the first 24 hours of dosing (e.g., 6 mg/kg IV every 12 hours on day 1 followed by 3 mg/kg IV every 12 hours). Without the loading dose, accumulation occurs during twice daily multiple dosing with steady state plasma voriconazole concentrations being achieved by day 6 in the majority of subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The pharmacokinetic properties of voriconazole are similar following administration by the intravenous and oral routes. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of pooled data in healthy subjects (N=207), the oral bioavailability of voriconazole is estimated to be 96% (CV 13%). Bioequivalence was established between the 200 mg tablet and the 40 mg/mL oral suspension when administered as a 400 mg every 12 hours loading dose followed by a 200 mg every 12 hours maintenance dose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are achieved 1-2 hours after dosing. When multiple doses of voriconazole are administered with high-fat meals, the mean Cmax and AUC are reduced by 34% and 24%, respectively when administered as a tablet and by 58% and 37% respectively when administered as the oral suspension <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In healthy subjects, the absorption of voriconazole is not affected by coadministration of oral ranitidine, cimetidine, or omeprazole, drugs that are known to increase gastric pH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The volume of distribution at steady state for voriconazole is estimated to be 4.6 L/kg, suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. Plasma protein binding is estimated to be 58% and was shown to be independent of plasma concentrations achieved following single and multiple oral doses of 200 mg or 300 mg (approximate range: 0.9-15 g/mL). Varying degrees of hepatic and renal impairment do not affect the protein binding of voriconazole.<br/>

<span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies showed that voriconazole is metabolized by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">In vivo</span> studies indicated that CYP2C19 is significantly involved in the metabolism of voriconazole. This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The major metabolite of voriconazole is the N-oxide, which accounts for 72% of the circulating radiolabelled metabolites in plasma. Since this metabolite has minimal antifungal activity, it does not contribute to the overall efficacy of voriconazole.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Excretion</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole is eliminated via hepatic metabolism with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine. After administration of a single radiolabelled dose of either oral or IV voriconazole, preceded by multiple oral or IV dosing, approximately 80% to 83% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine. The majority (&gt;94%) of the total radioactivity is excreted in the first 96 hours after both oral and intravenous dosing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a result of non-linear pharmacokinetics, the terminal half-life of voriconazole is dose dependent and therefore not useful in predicting the accumulation or elimination of voriconazole.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a multiple oral dose study, the mean Cmax and AUCt for healthy young females were 83% and 113% higher, respectively, than in healthy young males (18-45 years), after tablet dosing. In the same study, no significant differences in the mean Cmax and AUC were observed between healthy elderly males and healthy elderly females (&gt;65 years). In a similar study, after dosing with the oral suspension, the mean AUC for healthy young females was 45% higher than in healthy young males whereas the mean Cmax was comparable between genders. The steady state trough voriconazole concentrations (Cmin) seen in females were 100% and 91% higher than in males receiving the tablet and the oral suspension, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the clinical program, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of gender. The safety profile and plasma concentrations observed in male and female subjects were similar. Therefore, no dosage adjustment based on gender is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In an oral multiple dose study the mean Cmax and AUC in healthy elderly males (65 years) were 61% and 86% higher, respectively, than in young males (18-45 years). No significant differences in the mean Cmax and AUC were observed between healthy elderly females (65 years) and healthy young females (18-45 years).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the clinical program, no dosage adjustment was made on the basis of age. An analysis of pharmacokinetic data obtained from 552 patients from 10 voriconazole clinical trials showed that the median voriconazole plasma concentrations in the elderly patients (&gt;65 years) were approximately 80% to 90% higher than those in the younger patients (65 years) after either IV or oral administration. However, the safety profile of voriconazole in young and elderly subjects was similar and, therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly <span class="Italics">[see Use in Special Populations (8.5)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>Voriconazole exposures in the majority of pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 17 years were comparable to those in adults receiving the same dosing regimens.

<br/>
<br/>
After a single oral dose (200 mg) of voriconazole in 8 patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) and 4 patients with moderate (Child- Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the mean systemic exposure (AUC) was 3.2-fold higher than in age and weight matched controls with normal hepatic function. There was no difference in mean peak plasma concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) between the groups. When only the patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment were compared to controls, there was still a 2.3-fold increase in the mean AUC in the group with hepatic impairment compared to controls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In an oral multiple dose study, AUCt was similar in 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) given a lower maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily compared to 6 subjects with normal hepatic function given the standard 200 mg twice daily maintenance dose. The mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 20% lower in the hepatically impaired group. No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a single oral dose (200 mg) study in 24 subjects with normal renal function and mild to severe renal impairment, systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) of voriconazole were not significantly affected by renal impairment. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing in patients with mild to severe renal impairment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a multiple dose study of IV voriconazole (6 mg/kg IV loading dose x 2, then 3 mg/kg IV x 5.5 days) in 7 patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min), the systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were not significantly different from those in 6 subjects with normal renal function.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min), accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, SBECD, occurs. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) of SBECD were increased 4-fold and almost 50%, respectively, in the moderately impaired group compared to the normal control group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis showed that voriconazole is dialyzed with clearance of 121 mL/min. The intravenous vehicle, SBECD, is hemodialyzed with clearance of 55 mL/min. A 4-hour hemodialysis session does not remove a sufficient amount of voriconazole to warrant dose adjustment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span> .<br/>

<span class="Bold">Effects of Other Drugs on Voriconazole</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Voriconazole is metabolized by the human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Results of in vitro metabolism studies indicate that the affinity of voriconazole is highest for CYP2C19, followed by CYP2C9, and is appreciably lower for CYP3A4. Inhibitors or inducers of these three enzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole systemic exposure (plasma concentrations), respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">The systemic exposure to voriconazole is significantly reduced or is expected to be reduced by the concomitant administration of the following agents and their use is contraindicated:</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Rifampin (potent CYP450 inducer)</span>–Rifampin (600 mg once daily) decreased the steady state Cmax and AUCt of voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours x 7 days) by an average of 93% and 96%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Doubling the dose of voriconazole to 400 mg every 12 hours does not restore adequate exposure to voriconazole during coadministration with rifampin. <span class="Bold">Coadministration of voriconazole and rifampin is contraindicated</span><span class="Italics">[see  Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Ritonavir (potent CYP450 inducer; CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate)</span>–The effect of the coadministration of voriconazole and ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg) was investigated in two separate studies. High-dose ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours for 9 days) decreased the steady state Cmax and AUCt of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) by an average of 66% and 82%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Low-dose ritonavir (100 mg every 12 hours for 9 days) decreased the steady state Cmax and AUC of oral voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours for 1 day, then 200 mg every 12 hours for 8 days) by an average of 24% and 39%, respectively, in healthy subjects. Although repeat oral administration of voriconazole did not have a significant effect on steady state Cmax and AUCt of high-dose ritonavir in healthy subjects, steady state Cmax and AUCt of low- dose ritonavir decreased slightly by 24% and 14% respectively, when administered concomitantly with oral voriconazole in healthy subjects. <span class="Bold">Coadministration of voriconazole and high-dose ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) is contraindicated.

<span class="Bold">Effects of Voriconazole on Other Drugs</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with human hepatic microsomes show that voriconazole inhibits the metabolic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. In these studies, the inhibition potency of voriconazole for CYP3A4 metabolic activity was significantly less than that of two other azoles, ketoconazole and itraconazole. In vitro studies also show that the major metabolite of voriconazole, voriconazole N-oxide, inhibits the metabolic activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to a greater extent than that of CYP2C19.

An increase in the incidence of delayed and persistent alfentanil-associated nausea and vomiting during co-administration of voriconazole and alfentanil was also observed. Reduction in the dose of alfentanil or other opiates that are also metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., sufentanil), and extended close monitoring of patients for respiratory and other opiate-associated adverse events, may be necessary when any of these opiates is coadministered with voriconazole <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span> .<br/>

It is recommended that dose adjustment of the benzodiazepine be considered during coadministration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Calcium Channel Blockers (CYP3A4 substrates)</span>–Although not studied clinically, voriconazole has been shown to inhibit felodipine metabolism in vitro (human liver microsomes). Therefore, voriconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers that are metabolized by CYP3A4. Frequent monitoring for adverse events and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is recommended during coadministration. Dose adjustment of the calcium channel blocker may be needed <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Sulfonylureas (CYP2C9 substrates)</span>–Although not studied in vitro or in vivo, voriconazole may increase plasma concentrations of sulfonylureas (e.g., tolbutamide, glipizide, and glyburide) and therefore cause hypoglycemia. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose and appropriate adjustment (i.e., reduction) of the sulfonylurea dosage is recommended during coadministration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span> .<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Vinca Alkaloids (CYP3A4 substrates)</span>–Although not studied in vitro or in vivo, voriconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) and lead to neurotoxicity. Therefore, reserve azole antifungals, including voriconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span> .<br/>

<span class="Bold">Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs; CYP2C9 substrates)</span>: In two independent published studies, single doses of ibuprofen (400 mg) and diclofenac (50 mg) were coadministered with the last dose of voriconazole (400 mg every 12 hours on Day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 hours on Day 2). Voriconazole increased the mean Cmax and AUC of the pharmacologically active isomer, S (+)-ibuprofen by 20% and 100%, respectively. Voriconazole increased the mean Cmax and AUC of diclofenac by 114% and 78%, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A reduction in ibuprofen and diclofenac dosage may be needed during concomitant administration with voriconazole. Patients receiving voriconazole concomitantly with other NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib, naproxen, lornoxicam, meloxicam) that are also metabolized by CYP2C9 should be carefully monitored for NSAID-related adverse events and toxicity, and dosage reduction should be made if warranted <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span> .<br/>

Administration of a higher voriconazole dose (400 mg every 12 hours x 7 days) with phenytoin (300 mg once daily) resulted in comparable steady state voriconazole Cmax and AUC estimates as compared to when voriconazole was given at 200 mg every 12 hours without phenytoin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Phenytoin may be coadministered with voriconazole if the maintenance dose of voriconazole is increased from 4 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours or from 200 mg to 400 mg orally, every 12 hours (100 mg to 200 mg orally, every 12 hours in patients less than 40 kg) <span class="Italics">[see  Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7)].</span><br/>

<br/>
Voriconazole  is  an  azole  antifungal   dru g.  The  primary  mode  of  action  of  voriconazole  is  the  inhibition  of  fungal  cytochrome   P - 450- mediated  14  alpha -lanosterol   demethylation,  an  essential  step  in  fungal  ergosterol  biosynthesis.  The  accumulation  of  14  alpha -methyl sterols  correlates   with  the  subsequent  loss  of  ergosterol  in  the  fungal  cell  wall  and  may  be  responsible  for  the  antifungal  activity  of voriconazole.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Resistance</span><br/>
<br/>
A  potential   for  development  of  resistance  to  voriconazole  is  well  known.  The  mechanisms  of  resistance  may  include  mutations  in  the gene  ERG11  (encodes  for  the  target  enzyme,  lanosterol  1 4-α - de methylase),  upregulation  of  genes  encoding  the  AT P -binding  cassette efflux  t ransporters  i.e.,  Candida  drug  resistance  (CDR)  pumps  and  reduced  access  of  the  drug  to  the  target,  or  some  c o m bination  of those  mechanism s.  The  frequency  of  drug  resistance  development  for  the  various  fungi  for  which  this  drug  is  indicated  is  not  known. </p><p>F ungal  isolates  exhibiting  reduced  susceptibility  to  fluconazole  or  itraconazole  may  also  show  reduced  susceptibility  to  voric onazole, suggesting  cros s -resistance  can  occur  among  these  azoles.

Patients were randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either voriconazole (n=283) or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (n=139). Patients were treated with randomized study drug for a median of 15 days. Most of the candidemia in patients evaluated for efficacy was caused by <span class="Italics">C. albicans (46%)</span>, followed by <span class="Italics">C. tropicalis (19%)</span>, <span class="Italics">C. parapsilosis (17%), C. glabrata (15%)</span>, and <span class="Italics">C. krusei (1%).</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An independent Data Review Committee (DRC), blinded to study treatment, reviewed the clinical and mycological data from this study, and generated one assessment of response for each patient. A successful response required all of the following: resolution or improvement in all clinical signs and symptoms of infection, blood cultures negative for Candida, infected deep tissue sites negative for Candida or resolution of all local signs of infection, and no systemic antifungal therapy other than study drug. The primary analysis, which counted DRC-assessed successes at the fixed time point (12 weeks after End of Therapy [EOT]), demonstrated that voriconazole was comparable to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (response rates of 41% and 41%, respectively) in the treatment of candidemia. Patients who did not have a 12-week assessment for any reason were considered a treatment failure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The overall clinical and mycological success rates by Candida species in Study 150-608 are presented in Table 15.<br/>

<span class="Sup">b</span> Patients who did not have a 12-week assessment for any reason were considered a treatment failure.<br/>
<br/>
In a secondary analysis, which counted DRC-assessed successes at any time point (EOT, or 2, 6, or 12 weeks after EOT), the response rates were 65% for voriconazole and 71% for the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In Studies 608 and 309/604 (non-comparative study in patients with invasive fungal infections who were refractory to, or intolerant of, other antifungal agents), voriconazole was evaluated in 35 patients with deep tissue Candida infections. A favorable response was seen in 4 of 7 patients with intra-abdominal infections, 5 of 6 patients with kidney and bladder wall infections, 3 of 3 patients with deep tissue abscess or wound infection, 1 of 2 patients with pneumonia/pleural space infections, 2 of 4 patients with skin lesions, 1 of 1 patients with mixed intra-abdominal and pulmonary infection, 1 of 2 patients with suppurative phlebitis, 1 of 3 patients with hepatosplenic infection, 1 of 5 patients with osteomyelitis, 0 of 1 with liver infection, and 0 of 1 with cervical lymph node infection.<br/></p><h3>14 .3 Esophageal Candidiasis</h3><p>The  efficacy  of  oral  voriconazole  200  mg  twice  daily   co mpared  to  oral  fluconazole  200  mg  once  daily  in  the  primary  treatment  of   EC w as  demonstrated  in  Study  15 0 - 305,  a double -blind,  double -dummy  study  in  immunocompromised  patients  with  endoscopicall y- proven   E C.  Patients  were  treated  for  a  median  of  15  days  (range  1  to  49  days).  Outcome  was  assessed  by  repeat  endos copy  at  end  of treatment  (EOT ).  A  successful  response   was  defined  as  a  normal  endoscopy  <br/>

For  patients  in  the  Intent -t o -Treat  (ITT)  population  with  only  a baseline  endoscopy,  a successful  response  was defined  as   symptomatic  cure  or  improvement  at EOT  compared  to  baseline.
