Aggressive doses of phosphate may result in a transient serum elevation followed by redistribution into intracellular compartments or bone tissue. It is recommended that repletion of severe hypophosphatemia be done IV because large doses of oral phosphate may cause diarrhea and intestinal absorption may be unreliable. Intermittent IV infusion should be reserved for severe depletion situations; requires continuous cardiac monitoring. Guidelines differ based on degree of illness, need/use of TPN, and severity of hypophosphatemia. Obese patients and/or severe renal impairment were excluded from phosphate supplement trials. <b>Note:</b> 1 mmol phosphate = 31 mg phosphorus; 1 mg phosphorus = 0.032 mmol phosphate.</p><p><i>Critically-ill adult patients receiving concurrent enteral/parenteral nutrition (Brown, 2006; Clark, 1995):</i> <b>Note:</b> Round doses to the nearest 7.5 mmol for ease of preparation. If administering with phosphate-containing parenteral nutrition, do not exceed 15 mmol/L within parenteral nutrition.

Hypophosphatemia may occur in the presence of low, normal, or high total body phosphate and conversely, phosphate depletion may exist with normal, low, or elevated levels of serum phosphate (Gaasbeek 2005). It is difficult to provide concrete guidelines for the treatment of severe hypophosphatemia because the extent of total body deficits and response to therapy are difficult to predict. Aggressive doses of phosphate may result in a transient serum elevation followed by redistribution into intracellular compartments or bone tissue. If hypokalemia exists, consider another phosphate replacement strategy with potassium (eg, potassium phosphates). Various regimens for replacement of phosphate in adults have been studied. The regimens below have only been studied in adult patients; however, many institutions have used them in children safely and successfully (ASPEN [Corkins 2015]). Obese patients and/or patients with severe renal impairment were excluded from phosphate supplement trials. <b>Note:</b> 1 mmol phosphate = 31 mg phosphorus; 1 mg phosphorus = 0.032 mmol phosphate.</p><p>IV doses may be incorporated into the patient's maintenance IV fluids; intermittent IV infusion should be reserved for severe depletion situations; requires continuous cardiac monitoring. <b>Note:</b> Doses listed as mmol of <b>phosphate</b>.</p><p>Children and Adolescents: <b>Note:</b> There are no prospective studies of parenteral phosphate replacement in children. The following weight-based guidelines for adult dosing may be cautiously employed in pediatric patients (ASPEN [Corkins 2015]). Guidelines differ based on degree of illness, use of TPN, and severity of hypophosphatemia.</p><p><i>General replacement guidelines</i> (Lentz 1978): <b>Note:</b> The initial dose may be increased by 25% to 50% if the patient is symptomatic secondary to hypophosphatemia and lowered by 25% to 50% if the patient is hypercalcemic.</p><p>Low dose: 0.08 mmol/kg over 6 hours; use if losses are recent and uncomplicated.</p><p>Intermediate dose: 0.16 to 0.24 mmol/kg over 4 to 6 hours; use if serum phosphorus level 0.5 to 1 mg/dL (0.16 to 0.32 mmol/L).</p><p>High dose: 0.36 mmol/kg over 6 hours; use if serum phosphorus &lt;0.5 mg/dL (&lt;0.16 mmol/L).</p><p><i>Patients receiving TPN</i> (Clark 1995):</p><p>Low dose: 0.16 mmol/kg over 4 to 6 hours; use if serum phosphorus level 2.3 to 3 mg/dL (0.73 to 0.96 mmol/L).</p><p>Intermediate dose: 0.32 mmol/kg over 4 to 6 hours; use if serum phosphorus level 1.6 to 2.2 mg/dL (0.51 to 0.72 mmol/L).</p><p>High dose: 0.64 mmol/kg over 8 to 12 hours; use if serum phosphorus &lt;1.5 mg/dL (&lt;0.5 mmol/L).</p><p><i>Critically ill adult trauma patients receiving TPN</i> (Brown 2006):</p><p>Low dose: 0.32 mmol/kg over 4 to 6 hours; use if serum phosphorus level 2.3 to 3 mg/dL (0.73 to 0.96 mmol/L).</p><p>Intermediate dose: 0.64 mmol/kg over 4 to 6 hours; use if serum phosphorus level 1.6 to 2.2 mg/dL (0.51 to 0.72 mmol/L).</p><p>High dose: 1 mmol/kg over 8 to 12 hours; use if serum phosphorus &lt;1.5 mg/dL (&lt;0.5 mmol/L).</p><p><i>Alternative method in critically ill patients</i> (Kingston 1985):</p><p>Low dose: 0.25 mmol/kg over 4 hours; use if serum phosphorus level 0.5 to 1 mg/dL (0.16 to 0.32 mmol/L).</p><p>Moderate dose: 0.5 mmol/kg over 4 hours; use if serum phosphorus level &lt;0.5 mg/dL (&lt;0.16 mmol/L).</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Must be diluted before administration; appropriate volume of diluent and maximum concentration have not been determined for intermittent phosphate repletion. Administer within 24 hours of preparation due to risk of microbial contamination.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Must be diluted prior to parenteral administration. In general, the dose, concentration of infusion, and rate of administration may be dependent on patient condition and specific institution policy. For adult patients with severe symptomatic hypophosphatemia (ie, &lt;1.5 mg/dL), may administer at rates up to 15 mmol/hour (Charron 2003; Rosen 1995). In patients with renal dysfunction and/or less severe hypophosphatemia, slower administration rates (eg, over 4 to 6 hours) or oral repletion is recommended. Per the manufacturer, infusion time should not be &lt;8 hours and not &gt;24 hours.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials at ≤25°C (77°F); do not freeze.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Erdafitinib: Serum Phosphate Level-Altering Agents may diminish the therapeutic effect of Erdafitinib.  Management: Avoid coadministration of serum phosphate level-altering agents with erdafitinib before initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels (Days 14 to 21).<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>None reported by manufacturer.
