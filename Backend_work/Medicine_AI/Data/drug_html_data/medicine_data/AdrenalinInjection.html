</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Adrenalin</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain epinephrine.  It may not be specific to Adrenalin. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a medical facility to treat <i>hypotension with septic shock</i>. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins.</p><p>If you are using this medicine at home, make sure you or any of your family members understand exactly how to give them. Also, tell your doctor if you or your caregiver has severe arthritis of the hands. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>This medicine is <i>injected into the muscle of your outer thigh only</i>. Do not inject this medicine into a vein, into the muscle of your buttocks, or into your fingers, toes, hands, or feet. To do so, may increase the chance of having serious side effects.</p><p>This medicine comes with patient information and instructions leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>This medicine comes in 3 forms:<i>an autoinjector syringe and needle kit</i>, <i>a prefilled syringe</i>, or a <i>vial</i>. This contains the correct dose of medicine your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>This medicine comes with an <i>autoinjector trainer</i> and a separate trainer instructions for use. Be sure to practice first with your <i>autoinjector trainer</i> before an allergy emergency happens to make sure you are ready to use the real <i>Auvi-Q®, Adrenaclick®, EpiPen®, or EpiPen Jr® autoinjector</i> in an actual emergency. The <i>autoinjector trainer</i> has a <i>grey color (for Auvi-Q®, EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®)</i> or <i>beige color (for Adrenaclick®)</i> and does not contain any medicine or needle.</p><p>Inspect the autoinjector from time to time before needing it to ensure the <i>blue safety release (EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®)</i> is not raised and that the autoinjector can be easily remove from the carrier tube.</p><p>Do not remove the <i>blue safety release (EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®)</i>, the <i>gray end caps (Adrenaclick®)</i>, or the <i>red safety guard (Auvi-Q®)</i> on the autoinjector until you are ready to use it. <i>Do not put your thumb, fingers, or hand over the black base (Auvi-Q®), orange (EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®), or red (Adrenaclick®) tip of the autoinjector or over the needle of the Symjepi® prefilled syringe</i>. This is to avoid an accidental injection.</p><p>If you are about to use the autoinjector, pull up straight the <i>blue safety release (EpiPen® or EpiPen Jr®)</i> with one hand and hold the pen with the other hand. Do <i>not</i> flip the blue safety release off using the thumb or by pulling it sideways, or by bending and twisting it. This may activate the device by accident (a "click is heard, the orange needle is extended, and the window is blocked), making it unusable in case of an emergency. Push the needle end (orange end of the autoinjector) firmly against the outer thigh until it "clicks". This signals that the injection has started. The autoinjector needs to stay in place for a minimum of 3 seconds following activation.</p><p>If you use the <i>Symjepi® prefilled syringe</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to use it.</li>
<li>Slowly inject the syringe into the thigh while sitting down.</li>
<li>Push the plunger all the way down until you hear a "clicking" sound. Hold it for 2 seconds.</li>
<li>Remove the syringe and massage the area for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Call your medical provider right away after injection.</li>
</ul><p>You may need to use more than one injection if your allergic reaction does not get better after the first shot. If more than 2 injections are needed for 1 reaction, however, those should be given only under medical supervision.</p><p>If you are using the epinephrine injection in a child, make sure to hold his leg firmly in place and limit movement before and during an injection.</p><p>Carry this medicine with you at all times for emergency use in case you have a severe allergic reaction.</p><p>Check the injection kits regularly to make sure that the liquid has not changed its color. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use this medicine if the liquid has changed its color (pinkish or brown in color), has become cloudy, or if there are particles in it.</p><p>Do not reuse the remaining portion of the medicine that is left in the autoinjector, prefilled syringe, or vial. Throw away the autoinjector, prefilled syringe, or vial after you have used it.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Epinephrine may not work as well and may cause gas gangrene. Check with your doctor or go to the hospital emergency room right away to get additional treatment.</p><p>Do not inject this medicine into your hands or feet.

Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, irregular heartbeat, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, trouble breathing, or weight gain.
