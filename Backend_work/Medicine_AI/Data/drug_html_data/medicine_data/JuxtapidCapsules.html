</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">JUXTAPID can cause elevations in transaminases. In the JUXTAPID clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients treated with JUXTAPID had at least one elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥3× upper limit of normal (ULN). There were no concomitant clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), or alkaline phosphatase <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">JUXTAPID also increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. The median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment may be a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then ALT and AST regularly as recommended. During treatment, adjust the dose of JUXTAPID if the ALT or AST are ≥3× ULN. Discontinue JUXTAPID for clinically significant liver toxicity [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, JUXTAPID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the JUXTAPID REMS Program <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span> Prescribe JUXTAPID only to patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis consistent with HoFH.

<li>The safety and effectiveness of JUXTAPID have not been established in patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not have HoFH, including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).</li>
<li>The effect of JUXTAPID on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</li>
</ul><h2>Juxtapid Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Initiation and Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Before beginning treatment with JUXTAPID:</p><ul>
<li>Measure transaminases (ALT, AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>;</li>
<li>Obtain a negative pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with JUXTAPID <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>;</li>
<li>Initiate a low-fat diet supplying &lt;20% of energy from fat <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span></li>
</ul><p>The recommended starting dosage of JUXTAPID is 5 mg once daily, and the dose should be escalated gradually based on acceptable safety and tolerability. Transaminases should be measured prior to any increase in dose <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. The maintenance dosage of JUXTAPID should be individualized, taking into account patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response to treatment, to a maximum of 60 mg daily as described in Table 1. Modify dosing for patients taking concomitant weak CYP3A4 inhibitors and for those with renal impairment or baseline hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), (2.5), and (2.6)]</span>. Monitor transaminases during treatment with JUXTAPID as described in <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>, and reduce or withhold dosing for patients who develop transaminase values ≥3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].</span></p><p>To reduce the risk of developing a fat-soluble nutrient deficiency due to JUXTAPID's mechanism of action in the small intestine, patients treated with JUXTAPID should take daily supplements that contain 400 international units vitamin E and at least 200 mg linoleic acid, 210 mg alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), 110 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 80 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>].</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First">JUXTAPID should be taken once daily with a glass of water, without food, at least 2 hours after the evening meal because administration with food may increase the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span> Patients should swallow Juxtapid Capsules whole. Capsules should not be opened, crushed, dissolved, or chewed.</p><h3>Dosing with Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">JUXTAPID is contraindicated with concomitant use of moderate and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><p>The recommended maximum dosage of JUXTAPID is 30 mg daily with concomitant use of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as alprazolam, amiodarone, amlodipine, atorvastatin, bicalutamide, cilostazol, cimetidine, cyclosporine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ginkgo, goldenseal, isoniazid, lapatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, ranitidine, ranolazine, ticagrelor, zileuton). However, the recommended maximum dosage of JUXTAPID is 40 mg daily with concomitant use of oral contraceptives.</p><p>When initiating a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor in a patient already taking JUXTAPID 10 mg daily or more, decrease the dose of JUXTAPID by half; patients taking JUXTAPID 5 mg daily may continue with the same dosage. Careful titration of JUXTAPID may then be considered according to LDL-C response and safety/tolerability to a maximum recommended dosage of 30 mg daily except when coadministered with oral contraceptives, in which case the maximum recommended lomitapide dosage is 40 mg daily <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Dose Modification Based on Elevated Transaminases</h3><p class="First">Table 2 summarizes recommendations for dose adjustment and monitoring for patients who develop elevated transaminases during therapy with JUXTAPID <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><ul>
<li>Confirm elevation with a repeat measurement within one week.</li>
<li>If confirmed, reduce the dose and obtain additional liver-related tests if not<br/>
already measured (such as alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and INR).</li>
<li>Repeat tests weekly and withhold dosing if there are signs of abnormal liver<br/>
function (increase in bilirubin or INR), if transaminase levels rise above 5× ULN,<br/>
or if transaminase levels do not fall below 3× ULN within approximately 4 weeks.<br/>
In these cases of persistent or worsening abnormalities, also investigate to identify<br/>
the probable cause.</li>
<li>If resuming JUXTAPID after transaminases resolve to &lt;3× ULN, consider<br/>
reducing the dose and monitor liver-related tests more frequently.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Withhold dosing, obtain additional liver-related tests if not already measured<br/>
(such as alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and INR), and investigate to identify<br/>
the probable cause.</li>
<li>If resuming JUXTAPID after transaminases resolve to &lt;3× ULN, reduce the dose<br/>
and monitor liver-related tests more frequently.</li>
</ul><p>If transaminase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-like symptoms), increases in bilirubin ≥2× ULN, or active liver disease, discontinue treatment with JUXTAPID and investigate to identify the probable cause <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis should not exceed 40 mg daily. There are no data available to guide dosing in other patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><h3>Dosing in Patients with Baseline Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) should not exceed 40 mg daily <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">5 mg: Orange/orange hard gelatin capsule printed with black ink "A733" and "5 mg"</p><p>10 mg: Orange/white hard gelatin capsule printed with black ink "A733" and "10 mg"</p><p>20 mg: White/white hard gelatin capsule printed with black ink "A733" and "20 mg"</p><p>30 mg: Orange/yellow hard gelatin capsule printed with black ink "A733" and "30 mg"</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">JUXTAPID is contraindicated in the following conditions:</p><ul>
<li>Pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>Concomitant administration of JUXTAPID with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, as this can increase JUXTAPID exposure <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></li>
<li>Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (based on Child-Pugh category B or C) and patients with active liver disease, including unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">JUXTAPID can cause elevations in transaminases and hepatic steatosis, as described below <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. To what extent JUXTAPID-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in transaminases is unknown. Although cases of hepatic dysfunction (elevated transaminases with increase in bilirubin or INR) or hepatic failure have not been reported, there is concern that JUXTAPID could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of JUXTAPID in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elevation of Transaminases</span></p><p>Elevations in transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are associated with JUXTAPID. In the clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients with HoFH had at least one elevation in ALT or AST ≥3× ULN, and 4 (14%) of the patients had at least one elevation in ALT or AST ≥5× ULN. There were no concomitant or subsequent clinically meaningful elevations in bilirubin, INR, or alkaline phosphatase <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p>During the 78-week HoFH clinical trial, no patients discontinued prematurely because of elevated transaminases. Among the 19 patients who subsequently enrolled in the HoFH extension study, one discontinued because of increased transaminases that persisted despite several dose reductions, and one temporarily discontinued because of markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24× ULN, AST 13× ULN) that had several possible causes, including a drug-drug interaction between JUXTAPID and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Monitoring of Transaminases</span></p><p>Before initiating JUXTAPID and during treatment, monitor transaminases as recommended in Table 3.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.</li>
<li>If abnormal, consider initiating JUXTAPID only after an appropriate work-up and the baseline abnormalities have been explained or resolved.</li>
<li>JUXTAPID is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, or active liver disease, including unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>Measure liver-related tests (ALT and AST, at a minimum) prior to each increase in dose or monthly, whichever occurs first.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Measure liver-related tests (ALT and AST, at a minimum) at least every 3 months and before any increase in dose.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>If transaminases are abnormal, reduce or withhold dosing of JUXTAPID and monitor as recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].</span></li>
<li>Discontinue JUXTAPID for persistent or clinically significant elevations.</li>
<li>If transaminase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-like symptoms), increases in bilirubin ≥2× ULN, or active liver disease, discontinue treatment with JUXTAPID and identify the probable cause.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Steatosis</span></p><p>JUXTAPID increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. The long-term consequences of hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment are unknown. During the HoFH clinical trial, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 weeks and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Clinical data suggest that hepatic fat accumulation is reversible after stopping treatment with JUXTAPID, but whether histological sequelae remain is unknown, especially after long-term use; protocol liver biopsies were not performed in the HoFH clinical trial.</p><p>Alcohol may increase levels of hepatic fat and induce or exacerbate liver injury. It is recommended that patients taking JUXTAPID should not consume more than one alcoholic drink per day.</p><p>Caution should be exercised when JUXTAPID is used with other medications known to have potential for hepatotoxicity, such as isotretinoin, amiodarone, acetaminophen (&gt;4 g/day for ≥3 days/week), methotrexate, tetracyclines, and tamoxifen. The effect of concomitant administration of JUXTAPID with other hepatotoxic medications is unknown. More frequent monitoring of liver-related tests may be warranted.</p><p>JUXTAPID has not been studied concomitantly with other LDL-lowering agents that can also increase hepatic fat. Therefore, the combined use of such agents is not recommended.</p><h3>JUXTAPID REMS Program</h3><p class="First">Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with JUXTAPID therapy, JUXTAPID is available through a restricted program under the REMS. Under the JUXTAPID REMS, only certified healthcare providers and pharmacies may prescribe and distribute JUXTAPID. Further information is available at www.JUXTAPIDREMSProgram.com or by telephone at 1-85-JUXTAPID (1-855-898-2743).</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on findings from animal studies, JUXTAPID use is contraindicated in pregnancy since it may cause fetal harm <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].</span> In animal reproduction studies in rats and ferrets, embryonic death and fetal malformations were observed at clinically relevant exposures. Females of reproductive potential should have a negative pregnancy test before starting JUXTAPID. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with JUXTAPID and for two weeks after the final dose. If pregnancy is detected, discontinue JUXTAPID.</p><h3>Reduced Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Serum Fatty Acids</h3><p class="First">Given its mechanism of action in the small intestine, JUXTAPID may reduce the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. In the HoFH clinical trial, patients were provided daily dietary supplements of vitamin E, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In this trial, the median levels of serum vitamin E, ALA, linoleic acid, EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid decreased from baseline to Week 26 but remained above the lower limit of the reference range. Adverse clinical consequences of these reductions were not observed with JUXTAPID treatment of up to 78 weeks. Patients treated with JUXTAPID should take daily supplements that contain 400 international units vitamin E and at least 200 mg linoleic acid, 210 mg ALA, 110 mg EPA, and 80 mg DHA <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. Patients with chronic bowel or pancreatic diseases that predispose to malabsorption may be at increased risk for deficiencies in these nutrients with use of JUXTAPID.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported by 27 (93%) of 29 patients in the HoFH clinical trial. Diarrhea occurred in 79% of patients, nausea in 65%, dyspepsia in 38%, and vomiting in 34%. Other reactions reported by at least 20% of patients include abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, constipation, and flatulence <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><p>Gastrointestinal adverse reactions of severe intensity were reported by 6 (21%) of 29 patients in the HoFH clinical trial, with the most common being diarrhea (4 patients, 14%); vomiting (3 patients, 10%); and abdominal pain, distension, and/or discomfort (2 patients, 7%). Gastrointestinal reactions contributed to the reasons for early discontinuation from the trial for 4 (14%) patients.</p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of severe diarrhea with the use of JUXTAPID, including patients being hospitalized because of diarrhea-related complications such as volume depletion. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications from diarrhea, such as older patients and patients taking drugs that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension. Instruct patients to stop JUXTAPID and contact their healthcare provider if severe diarrhea occurs or if they experience symptoms of volume depletion such as lightheadedness, decreased urine output, or tiredness. In such cases, consider reducing the dose or suspending use of JUXTAPID.</p><p>Absorption of concomitant oral medications may be affected in patients who develop diarrhea or vomiting.</p><p>To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events, patients should adhere to a low-fat diet supplying &lt;20% of energy from fat and the dosage of JUXTAPID should be increased gradually <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use of CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of lomitapide, with strong inhibitors increasing exposure approximately 27-fold. Concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with JUXTAPID is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span> In the JUXTAPID clinical trials, one patient with HoFH developed markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24× ULN, AST 13× ULN) within days of initiating the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin. If treatment with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, JUXTAPID should be stopped during the course of treatment.</p><p>Grapefruit juice must be omitted from the diet while being treated with JUXTAPID.</p><p>Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the exposure of lomitapide approximately 2-fold; therefore, when JUXTAPID is administered with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, the dose of JUXTAPID should be decreased by half. Careful titration may then be considered based on LDL-C response and safety/tolerability to a maximum recommended dosage of 30 mg daily except when coadministered with oral contraceptives, in which case the maximum recommended lomitapide dosage is 40 mg daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span></p><h3>Risk of Myopathy with Concomitant Use of Simvastatin or Lovastatin</h3><p class="First">The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, with simvastatin and lovastatin monotherapy is dose related. Lomitapide approximately doubles the exposure to simvastatin; therefore, it is recommended to reduce the dose of simvastatin by 50% when initiating JUXTAPID <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. While taking JUXTAPID, limit simvastatin dosage to 20 mg daily (or 40 mg daily for patients who have previously tolerated simvastatin 80 mg daily for at least one year without evidence of muscle toxicity). Refer to the simvastatin prescribing information for additional dosing recommendations.</p><p>Interaction between lovastatin and lomitapide has not been studied. However, the metabolizing enzymes and transporters responsible for the disposition of lovastatin and simvastatin are similar, suggesting that JUXTAPID may increase the exposure of lovastatin; therefore, reducing the dose of lovastatin should be considered when initiating JUXTAPID.</p><h3>Risk of Supratherapeutic or Subtherapeutic Anticoagulation with Warfarin</h3><p class="First">JUXTAPID increases the plasma concentrations of warfarin. Increases in the dose of JUXTAPID may lead to supratherapeutic anticoagulation, and decreases in the dose of JUXTAPID may lead to subtherapeutic anticoagulation. Difficulty controlling INR contributed to early discontinuation from the HoFH clinical trial for one of five patients taking concomitant warfarin. Patients taking warfarin should undergo regular monitoring of the INR, especially after any changes in JUXTAPID dosage. The dose of warfarin should be adjusted as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Malabsorption with Rare Hereditary Disorders of Galactose Intolerance</h3><p class="First">Patients with rare, hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should avoid JUXTAPID as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following important adverse reactions have been observed and are discussed in detail in other sections of the label:</p><ul>
<li>Risk of hepatotoxicity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and serum fatty acids <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
<li>Gastrointestinal adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>One single-arm, open-label, 78-week trial has been conducted in 29 patients with HoFH, 23 of whom completed at least one year of treatment. The initial dosage of JUXTAPID was 5 mg daily, with titration up to 60 mg daily during an 18-week period based on safety and tolerability. In this trial, the mean age was 30.7 years (range, 18 to 55 years), 16 (55%) patients were men, 25 (86%) patients were Caucasian, 2 (7%) were Asian, 1 (3%) was African American, and 1 (3%) was multi-racial <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>Five (17%) of the 29 patients with HoFH that participated in the clinical trial discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that contributed to treatment discontinuations included diarrhea (2 patients; 7%) and abdominal pain, nausea, gastroenteritis, weight loss, headache, and difficulty controlling INR on warfarin (1 patient each; 3%).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal, reported by 27 (93%) of 29 patients. Adverse reactions reported by ≥8 (28%) patients in the HoFH clinical trial included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Other common adverse reactions, reported by 5 to 7 (17-24%) patients, included weight loss, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, constipation, flatulence, increased ALT, chest pain, influenza, nasopharyngitis, and fatigue.</p><p>The adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of patients during the HoFH clinical trial are presented in Table 4.</p><p>Adverse reactions of severe intensity were reported by 8 (28%) of 29 patients, with the most common being diarrhea (4 patients, 14%), vomiting (3 patients, 10%), increased ALT or hepatotoxicity (3 patients, 10%), and abdominal pain, distension, and/or discomfort (2 patients, 7%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Transaminase Elevations</span></p><p>During the HoFH clinical trial, 10 (34%) of 29 patients had at least one elevation in ALT and/or AST ≥3× ULN (see Table 5). No clinically meaningful elevations in total bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase were observed. Transaminases typically fell within one to four weeks of reducing the dose or withholding JUXTAPID.</p><p>Among the 19 patients who enrolled in an extension study following the HoFH clinical trial, one discontinued because of increased transaminases that persisted despite several dose reductions, and one temporarily discontinued because of markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24× ULN, AST 13× ULN) that had several possible causes, including a drug-drug interaction between JUXTAPID and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Steatosis</span></p><p>Hepatic fat was prospectively measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in all eligible patients during the HoFH clinical trial. After 26 weeks, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat from baseline was 6%, and the mean absolute increase was 8% (range, 0% to 30%). After 78 weeks, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat from baseline was 6%, and the mean absolute increase was 7% (range, 0% to 18%). Among the 23 patients with evaluable data, on at least one occasion during the trial, 18 (78%) exhibited an increase in hepatic fat &gt;5% and 3 (13%) exhibited an increase &gt;20%. Data from individuals who had repeat measurements after stopping JUXTAPID show that hepatic fat accumulation is reversible, but whether histological sequelae remain is unknown.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of JUXTAPID. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to JUXTAPID exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal disorders:</span> Myalgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin reactions:</span> Alopecia</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Moderate and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">A strong CYP3A4 inhibitor has been shown to increase lomitapide exposure approximately 27-fold <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, tipranavir/ritonavir, voriconazole) with lomitapide is contraindicated. Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil) has not been studied, but concomitant use with lomitapide is contraindicated since lomitapide exposure will likely increase significantly in the presence of these inhibitors.</p><p>Patients must avoid grapefruit juice while taking JUXTAPID <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as alprazolam, amiodarone, amlodipine, atorvastatin, bicalutamide, cilostazol, cimetidine, cyclosporine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ginkgo, goldenseal, isoniazid, lapatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, ranitidine, ranolazine, ticagrelor, zileuton) can increase lomitapide exposure approximately 2-fold <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. When administered with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, the dose of JUXTAPID should be decreased by half. Careful titration of JUXTAPID may then be considered based on LDL-C response and safety/tolerability to a maximum recommended dosage of 30 mg daily except when coadministered with oral contraceptives, in which case the maximum recommended lomitapide dosage is 40 mg daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Lomitapide increases plasma concentrations of both R(+)-warfarin and S(-)-warfarin by approximately 30% and increased the INR 22%. Patients taking warfarin should undergo regular monitoring of INR, particularly after any changes in lomitapide dosage. The dose of warfarin should be adjusted as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><h3>Simvastatin and Lovastatin</h3><p class="First">The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, with simvastatin and lovastatin monotherapy is dose related. Lomitapide approximately doubles the exposure of simvastatin; therefore, the recommended dose of simvastatin should be reduced by 50% when initiating JUXTAPID <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. While taking JUXTAPID, limit simvastatin dosage to 20 mg daily (or 40 mg daily for patients who have previously tolerated simvastatin 80 mg daily for at least one year without evidence of muscle toxicity). Refer to the simvastatin prescribing information for simvastatin dosing recommendations.</p><p>Interaction between lovastatin and lomitapide has not been studied. However, the metabolizing enzymes and transporters responsible for the disposition of lovastatin and simvastatin are similar, suggesting that JUXTAPID may increase the exposure of lovastatin; therefore, reducing the dose of lovastatin should be considered when initiating JUXTAPID.</p><h3>P-glycoprotein Substrates</h3><p class="First">Lomitapide is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Coadministration of lomitapide with P-gp substrates (such as aliskiren, ambrisentan, colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, everolimus, fexofenadine, imatinib, lapatinib, maraviroc, nilotinib, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sirolimus, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan, topotecan) may increase the absorption of P-gp substrates. Dose reduction of the P-gp substrate should be considered when used concomitantly with lomitapide.</p><h3>Bile Acid Sequestrants</h3><p class="First">JUXTAPID has not been tested for interaction with bile acid sequestrants. Administration of JUXTAPID and bile acid sequestrants should be separated by at least 4 hours since bile acid sequestrants can interfere with the absorption of oral medications.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to JUXTAPID during pregnancy.

Fetal malformations included umbilical hernia, gastroschisis, imperforate anus, alterations in heart shape and size, limb malrotations, skeletal malformations of the tail, and delayed ossification of cranial, vertebral and pelvic bones.</p><p>Oral gavage doses of 1.6, 4, 10, or 25 mg/kg/day lomitapide given to pregnant ferrets from gestation day 12 through organogenesis were associated with both maternal toxicity and fetal malformations at exposures that ranged from less than the human exposure at the MRHD to 5-times the human exposure at the MRHD. Fetal malformations included umbilical hernia, medially rotated or short limbs, absent or fused digits on paws, cleft palate, open eye lids, low-set ears, and kinked tail.</p><p>Oral gavage doses of 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg/day lomitapide given to pregnant rabbits from gestation day 6 through organogenesis were not associated with adverse effects at systemic exposures up to 3-times the MRHD of 60 mg based on body surface area comparison. Treatment at doses of ≥20 mg/kg/day, ≥6-times the MRHD, resulted in embryo-fetal lethality.</p><p>Pregnant female rats given oral gavage doses of 0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg/day lomitapide from gestation day 7 through termination of nursing on lactation day 20 were associated with malformations at systemic exposures equivalent to human exposure at the MRHD of 60 mg based on AUC.

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dosing for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis should not exceed 40 mg daily since lomitapide exposure in these patients increased approximately 50% compared with healthy volunteers. Effects of mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease not yet receiving dialysis, on lomitapide exposure have not been studied. However, it is possible that patients with renal impairment who are not yet receiving dialysis may experience increases in lomitapide exposure exceeding 50% <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) should not exceed 40 mg daily since the lomitapide exposure in these patients increased approximately 50% compared with healthy volunteers. JUXTAPID is contraindicated in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment since the lomitapide exposure in patients with moderate hepatic impairment increased 164% compared with healthy volunteers <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no specific treatment in the event of overdose of JUXTAPID. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Liver-related tests should be monitored. Hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial given that lomitapide is highly protein bound.</p><h2>Juxtapid Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Juxtapid Capsules contain lomitapide mesylate, a synthetic lipid-lowering agent for oral administration.</p><p>The chemical name of lomitapide mesylate is N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-9-[4-[4-[[[4'-(trifluoromethyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl]carbonyl]amino]-1-piperidinyl]butyl]-9<span class="Italics">H</span>-fluorene-9-carboxamide, methanesulfonate salt.

Lomitapide mesylate is freely soluble in acetone, ethanol, and methanol; soluble in 2-butanol, methylene chloride, and acetonitrile; sparingly soluble in 1-octanol and 2-propanol; slightly soluble in ethyl acetate; and insoluble in heptane.</p><p>Each JUXTAPID capsule contains lomitapide mesylate equivalent to 5, 10, 20, or 30 mg lomitapide free base and the following inactive ingredients: pregelatinized starch, sodium starch glycolate, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate. The capsule shells of all strengths contain gelatin and titanium dioxide; the 5 mg, 10 mg and 30 mg capsules also contain red iron oxide; and the 30 mg capsules also contain yellow iron oxide. The imprinting ink contains shellac, black iron oxide, and propylene glycol.</p><h2>Juxtapid Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">JUXTAPID directly binds and inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing the assembly of apo B-containing lipoproteins in enterocytes and hepatocytes. This inhibits the synthesis of chylomicrons and VLDL. The inhibition of the synthesis of VLDL leads to reduced levels of plasma LDL-C.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Effects on QT Interval</span></p><p>At a concentration 23 times the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of the maximum recommended dose, lomitapide does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Upon oral administration of a single 60-mg dose of JUXTAPID, the lomitapide t<span class="Sub">max</span> is around 6 hours in healthy volunteers.

The metabolic pathways include oxidation, oxidative N-dealkylation, glucuronide conjugation, and piperidine ring opening. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolizes lomitapide to its major metabolites, M1 and M3, as detected in plasma. The oxidative N-dealkylation pathway breaks the lomitapide molecule into M1 and M3. M1 is the moiety that retains the piperidine ring, whereas M3 retains the rest of the lomitapide molecule <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. CYPs 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 2C19 may metabolize lomitapide to a small extent to M1.
