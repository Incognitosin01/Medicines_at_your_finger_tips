Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of contamination, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Ask your doctor about any possible risk.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is Dysport given?</h2><p>Dysport injections <b>should be given only by a trained medical professional</b>, even when used for cosmetic purposes.</p><p>This medicine is injected into a muscle by a healthcare provider. Dysport injections should be spaced at least 3 months apart. Children should not be treated with Dysport more often than every 12 to 16 weeks.</p><p>Dysport injections may be given into more than one area at a time, depending on the condition being treated.</p><p>The effects of a Dysport injection are temporary. Your symptoms may return completely within 3 months. After repeat injections, it may take less and less time before your symptoms return, especially if your body develops antibodies to the botulinum toxin.</p><p>Do not seek botulinum toxin injections from more than one medical professional at a time. If you switch healthcare providers, tell your new provider how long it has been since your last botulinum toxin injection.</p><p>Using this medicine more often than prescribed will not make it more effective and may result in serious side effects.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since botulinum toxin has a temporary effect and is given at widely spaced intervals, missing a dose is not likely to be harmful.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may not appear right away, but can include muscle weakness, trouble swallowing, and weak or shallow breathing.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving Dysport?</h2><p>Dysport may impair your vision or depth perception.
