Long-term opioid use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to sexual dysfunction, infertility, mood disorders, and osteoporosis (Brennan 2013).</p><p>• Biliary tract impairment: Use codeine with caution in patients with biliary tract dysfunction, including acute pancreatitis; may cause constriction of sphincter of Oddi; may increase amylase/lipase levels.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension and ischemic heart disease).</p><p>• CNS depression/coma: Avoid use in patients with CNS depression or coma as these patients are susceptible to intracranial effects of CO<sub>2</sub> retention.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use pseudoephedrine with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><p>• Gastrointestinal obstruction: Avoid use of codeine in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, particularly paralytic ileus; chronic use may result in obstructive bowel disease.</p><p>• Head trauma: Avoid use in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>• Increased intraocular pressure/glaucoma: Use pseudoephedrine with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure or angle-closure glaucoma.</p><p>• Obesity: Use codeine with caution in patients who are morbidly obese.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia/urinary obstruction: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or GU obstruction.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.</p><p>• Respiratory disease: Use with caution in patients with pulmonary disease (eg, asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, smoking) or persistent or chronic cough; dose-related respiratory depression occurs.</p><p>• Seizure disorder: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder; may produce CNS stimulation.</p><p>• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• CYP2D6 “ultrarapid metabolizers”: Use codeine with caution in patients with two or more copies of the variant CYP2D6*2 allele; may have extensive conversion to morphine and thus increased opioid-mediated effects. Avoid the use of codeine in these patients; consider alternative analgesics such as morphine or a nonopioid agent (Crews 2012). The occurrence of this phenotype is seen in 0.5% to 1% of Chinese and Japanese, 0.5% to 1% of Hispanics, 1% to 10% of Caucasians, 3% of African-Americans, and 16% to 28% of North Africans, Ethiopians, and Arabs.</p><p>• Debilitated patients: Use with caution in debilitated patients; there is a greater potential for critical respiratory depression, even at therapeutic dosages.</p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in the elderly; may be more sensitive to adverse effects.</p><p>• Neonates: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome: After chronic maternal exposure to opioids, neonatal withdrawal syndrome may occur in the newborn; monitor neonate closely. Signs and symptoms include irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. Onset, duration and severity depend on the drug used, duration of use, maternal dose, and rate of drug elimination by the newborn. Opioid withdrawal syndrome in the neonate, unlike in adults, may be life-threatening and should be treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts.</p><p>• Pediatric: Respiratory depression may occur even at therapeutic dosages; FDA and AAP recommend against use in pediatric patients &lt;18 years due to risk of adverse effects (AAP 2018; FDA 2018a; FDA 2018b). Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and were found to have evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism. Deaths have also occurred in nursing infants after being exposed to high concentrations of morphine in breast milk because the mothers were ultra-rapid metabolizers. Antihistamines may cause excitation in young children.</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity ("gasping syndrome") in neonates; the "gasping syndrome" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p>• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Zar 2007).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Abuse/misuse/diversion: Use codeine with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse or acute alcoholism; potential for drug dependency exists. Tolerance and psychological and physical dependence may occur with prolonged use. Health care provider should be alert to the potential for abuse, misuse, and diversion.</p><p>• Appropriate use: A special measuring device should be used to measure accurate doses for children &lt;6 years of age. Calibrated oral syringes are most accurate. Do not exceed the recommended dosages.</p><p>• Self-medication (OTC use): When used for self-medication (OTC), patients with a breathing problem or persistent or chronic cough (associated with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma or smoking) and/or productive cough (eg, excessive amounts of phlegm) should be evaluated by a health care provider prior to use. Discontinue use and notify health care provider if symptoms do not get better within 7 days or are accompanied by fever; cough last more than 7 days, comes back or occurs with fever, rash or headache that lasts; if nervousness, dizziness, or trouble sleeping occur.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Relief of symptoms; respiratory and mental status, blood pressure; bowel function</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Refer to individual monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat nose stuffiness.</p><p>• It is used to ease allergy signs.</p><p>• It is used to relieve coughing.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
