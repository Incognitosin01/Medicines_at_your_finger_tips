Dystrophin is a protein that helps stabilize the structure of muscle tissue and is necessary for proper muscle development and function. Without dystrophin, muscle fibers can become weak and easily damaged. This can affect voluntary movement such as walking.</p><p>Children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy have a mutation of a gene that would normally cause the body to produce dystrophin.</p><p>Eteplirsen is used in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Eteplirsen is not a cure for DMD, but  eteplirsen may lessen muscle weakness and muscle wasting caused by this disease.</p><p>Eteplirsen was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on an "accelerated" basis. In clinical studies, some children responded to this medicine. However, further studies are needed to determine if eteplirsen is generally effective in treating DMD.</p><p>Eteplirsen may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before your child receives eteplirsen, tell the doctor about all your child's medical conditions or allergies, and all the medicines the child uses.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Tell your child's doctor if any prior eteplirsen injections caused a severe allergic reaction in your child.</p><p>Before your child receives eteplirsen, tell the doctor about all your child's medical conditions or allergies, and all the medicines the child uses.</p><p>Although eteplirsen has been used mainly in children, it is not known whether  eteplirsen could be harmful if used during pregnancy or while nursing.</p><h2>How is eteplirsen given?</h2><p>Eteplirsen is given as an infusion into a vein.
