</ul><h2>Dallergy PE Syrup</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span><br/>
Each 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) of Dallergy PE Syrup contains:<br/>
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride..... 10 mg<br/>
Chlorpheniramine Maleate.....   2 mg<br/>
Methscopolamine Nitrate.....0.75 mg</p><p>Phenylephrine hydrochloride is a decongestant having the chemical name Benzenemethanol,<br/>
3-hydroxy-α-[(methylamino) methyl]-, hydrochloride.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine having the chemical name 2-pyridinepropanamine,<br/>
γ-(4 chlorophenyl)-N, N-dimethyl-, (Z) -2-butenedioate (1:1).</p><p>Methscopolamine nitrate is an anticholinergic having the chemical name 3-Oxa-9-azoniatricyclo,<br/>
[3.3.1.0] nonane, 7-(3-hydroxy-1-oxo-2-phenylpropoxy)-9, 9-dimethyl-, nitrate,<br/>
[7(S)-(1α, 2β, 4β, 5α, 7β)]-.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Inactive ingredients:</h2><p class="First">Citric acid, FD and C Red #40, FD and C Blue No. 1, glycerin, grape flavoring, maltitol, propylene<br/>
glycol, purified water, sodium saccharin, and sorbitol.</p><p>DALLERGY® PE SYRUP contains ingredients of the following therapeutic classes: nasal<br/>
decongestant, antihistamine, and antisecretory agent.<br/></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Phenylephrine hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic which acts predominantly on alpha receptors and<br/>
has little action on beta receptors. It, therefore, functions as an oral nasal decongestant with minimal<br/>
CNS stimulation.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine maleate is an alkylamine type antihistamine. This group of antihistamines is among<br/>
the most active histamine antagonists and is generally effective in relatively low doses. The drugs are<br/>
not so prone to produce drowsiness and are among the most suitable agents for daytime use; but<br/>
again, a significant proportion of patients do experience this effect.</p><p>Methscopolamine nitrate is a quaternary ammonium derivative of scopolamine, which possesses the<br/>
peripheral actions of the belladonna alkaloids, but does not exhibit the central actions because of its<br/>
lack of ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. In this formulation, it is used because of its antisecretory<br/>
effects on the respiratory system.<br/></p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">For the relief of upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergies and the common cold, such as:<br/>
nasal congestion, sinusitis, sneezing, lacrimation, vasomotor rhinitis, post-nasal drip, and hay fever.<br/></p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. Also contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension,<br/>
severe coronary artery disease, patients on MAO inhibitor therapy, patients with narrow angle<br/>
glaucoma, urinary retention, peptic ulcer, and during an asthmatic attack.<br/></p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Considerable caution should be exercised in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic<br/>
heart disease, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure, and prostatic hypertrophy. The elderly<br/>
(60 years or older) are more likely to exhibit adverse reactions. Antihistamines may cause excitability,<br/>
especially in children. At dosages higher than the recommended dose, nervousness, dizziness, or<br/>
sleeplessness may occur.<br/></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span><br/>
Caution should be exercised in patients with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or thyroid<br/>
disease. The antihistamine in this product may exhibit additive effects with other CNS depressants,<br/>
including alcohol.<br/></p><h2>Information for patients:</h2><p class="First">Antihistamines may cause drowsiness, and ambulatory patients who operate machinery or motor<br/>
vehicles should be cautioned accordingly.<br/></p><h2>Drug interactions:</h2><p class="First">MAO inhibitors and beta adrenergic blockers increase the effects of sympathomimetics.<br/>
Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, mecamylamine,<br/>
reserpine and veratrum alkaloids. Concomitant use of antihistamines with alcohol and other<br/>
CNS depressants may have an additive effect.<br/></p><h2>Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C:</h2><p class="First">It is not known whether DALLERGY® PE SYRUP can cause fetal harm when administered to a<br/>
pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. DALLERGY® PE SYRUP should be given<br/>
to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.<br/></p><h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted<br/>
in human milk, caution should be exercised when DALLERGY® PE SYRUP is administered to a<br/>
nursing woman.<br/></p><h2>Pediatric Use:</h2><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of DALLERGY® PE SYRUP in children below the age of 6 have not been established.<br/></p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions include drowsiness, lassitude, nausea, giddiness, dryness of mouth, blurred vision,<br/>
cardiac palpitations, flushing, increased irritability or excitement (especially in children).<br/></p><h2>OVERDOSAGE AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">In all cases of suspected overdose, immediately call your regional poison center, and/or contact a<br/>
physician immediately. The stomach should be emptied promptly by lavage or by induction of<br/>
emesis with syrup of ipecac. The installation of activated charcoal into the stomach also should be<br/>
considered. The treatment of overdose is essentially symptomatic and supportive. If respiratory<br/>
depression is present, treat promptly with oxygen and/or mechanical support of ventilation. If<br/>
convulsions or marked CNS excitement occurs, only short-acting benzodiazepine-type drugs should<br/>
be used.<br/></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and children 12 years of age and older:</span><br/>
