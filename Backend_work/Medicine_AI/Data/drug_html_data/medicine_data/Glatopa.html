It may not be specific to Glatopa. Please read with care.</b></p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine. It is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the hips, stomach, thighs, or upper arms. You or your caregiver may be trained to prepare and inject the medicine at home. Be sure that you understand how to use the medicine.</p><p>If you use this medicine at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections. Do not inject into skin areas that have scars or dents.</p><p>This medicine should come with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully.

<li>Remove one prefilled syringe from the carton in the refrigerator. Take the syringe out of the protective wrapper. Allow 20 minutes for the syringe to warm up to room temperature before injecting the medicine.</li>
<li>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe. It should be clear or colorless to slightly yellow. If the liquid is cloudy or has particles in it, do not use the syringe. Take out another syringe and follow the same steps for warming.</li>
<li>Choose an injection site on your body. Clean the injection site with a fresh alcohol wipe, and let it dry.</li>
<li>Pick up the 1-milliliter prefilled syringe and hold it as you would a pencil, using the hand you write with. Remove the plastic cover from the needle, but do not touch the needle itself.</li>
<li>Pinch about a 2-inch fold of skin between your thumb and index finger.</li>
<li>Insert the needle into the 2-inch fold of skin. It may help to steady your hand by resting the heel of your hand against your body.</li>
<li>When the needle is all the way in, release the fold of skin.</li>
<li>Inject the medicine by holding the syringe steady while pushing down on the plunger. The injection should take just a few seconds.</li>
<li>Pull the needle straight out.</li>
<li>Press a dry clean cotton ball on the injection site for a few seconds, but do not massage it.</li>
<li>Put the plastic cover back on the needle.</li>
<li>Throw away any unused medicine.</li>
