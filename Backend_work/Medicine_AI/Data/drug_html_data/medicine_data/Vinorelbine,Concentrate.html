Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with vinorelbine.  Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with vinorelbine at 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with vinorelbine administered at 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients.  Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days.</p><p>Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of vinorelbine. Do not administer vinorelbine to patients with neutrophil counts &lt;1,000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>.  Adjustments in the dosage of vinorelbine should be based on neutrophil counts obtained on the day of treatment [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Drug-induced liver injury manifest by elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin can occur in patients receiving vinorelbine alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of vinorelbine and periodically during treatment.  Reduce the dose of vinorelbine for patients who develop elevations in total bilirubin <span class="Bold">&gt;</span> 2 times upper limit of normal <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span> <span class="Italics">and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><h3>Severe Constipation and Bowel Obstruction</h3><p class="First">Severe and fatal paralytic ileus, constipation, intestinal obstruction, necrosis, and perforation occur with vinorelbine administration. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners.</p><h3>Extravasation and Tissue Injury</h3><p class="First">Extravasation of vinorelbine can result in severe irritation, local tissue necrosis and/or thrombophlebitis. If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur, immediately stop administration of vinorelbine and institute recommended management procedures <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span><span class="Italics">and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Neurologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Sensory and motor neuropathies, including severe neuropathies, occur in patients receiving vinorelbine. Monitor patients for new or worsening signs and symptoms of neuropathy such as paresthesia, hyperesthesia, hyporeflexia and muscle weakness while receiving vinorelbine.  Discontinue vinorelbine for NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater neuropathy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure</h3><p class="First">Pulmonary toxicity, including severe acute bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with use of vinorelbine.  Interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS included fatalities.  The mean time to onset of interstitial pneumonitis and ARDS after vinorelbine administration was one week (range 3 to 8 days) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p>Interrupt vinorelbine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, or have any evidence of pulmonary toxicity. Permanently discontinue vinorelbine for confirmed interstitial pneumonitis or ARDS.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus.  Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during therapy with vinorelbine <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.7)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Single Agent</span></p><p>The data below reflect exposure to vinorelbine as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer.  The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of vinorelbine. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% Caucasian, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology.  The data also reflect exposure to vinorelbine in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of vinorelbine.  Vinorelbine is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2.  The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of single agent vinorelbine were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy.  The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with vinorelbine experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued vinorelbine due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to vinorelbine discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Hematologic Adverse Reactions Experienced in &gt; 5% of Patients Receiving Vinorelbine *†:</span></p><p class="First"> </p><p class="First">All patients<br/>

Concurrent administration of vinorelbine with an inhibitor of this metabolic pathway may cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of adverse reactions.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category D</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits, embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0.33 and 0.18 times the human therapeutic dose, respectively.  If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In a mouse embryofetal development study, administration of a single dose of vinorelbine at a dose level of 9 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or greater (approximately 0.33 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) was embryotoxic and fetotoxic. Vinorelbine was embryotoxic and fetotoxic to pregnant rabbits when administered every 6 days during the period of organogenesis at doses of 5.5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (approximately 0.18 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) or greater.  At doses that did not cause maternal toxicity in either species, vinorelbine administration resulted in reduced fetal weight and delayed ossification.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is present in human milk. Because many drugs are present in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from vinorelbine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of vinorelbine in pediatric patients have not been established. Results from a single-arm study of vinorelbine administered at the dose of 33.75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (for 35 patients) or at the dose of 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (for 11 patients) every week during 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest was evaluated (courses of 8 weeks). Forty-six patients age 1 to 25 (median 11 years) with recurrent solid malignant tumors, including rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma (N=21 patients), neuroblastoma (N= 4 patients), and central nervous system (CNS) tumors (N=21 patients) were enrolled.  The most significant grade 3 or 4 hematological adverse reactions were neutropenia (70%) and anemia (33%). The most significant grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity adverse reactions were motor (15%) or cranial (13%) neuropathy, hypoxia (13%) and dyspnea (11%). Objective tumor response was observed in 2 out of 21 patients with  rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma.  No objective tumor response was observed in patients with CNS tumors (N=21) or neuroblastoma (N=4).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 769 number of patients who received vinorelbine alone and vinorelbine in combination with Cisplatin in studies 1, 2 and 3, 247 patients were 65 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between these patients and younger patients. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine has not been evaluated, but the liver plays an important role in the metabolism of vinorelbine. Elevations of aspartate aminotransferase occur in &gt; 60% of the patients receiving vinorelbine alone (6% Grade 3 to 4). Therefore, exercise caution in patients with hepatic impairment.

Overdoses involving quantities up to 10 times the recommended dose (30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) have been reported. The toxicities described were consistent with those listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section including paralytic ileus, stomatitis, and esophagitis. Bone marrow aplasia, sepsis, and paresis have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred following overdose of vinorelbine. If overdosage occurs, general supportive measures together with appropriate blood transfusions, growth factors, and antibiotics should be instituted as deemed necessary by the physician.</p><h2>Vinorelbine, Concentrate Description</h2><p class="First">Vinorelbine injection USP is for intravenous administration. Each vial contains vinorelbine tartrate, USP equivalent to 10 mg (1-mL vial) or 50 mg (5-mL vial) vinorelbine in water for injection. No preservatives or other additives are present. The aqueous solution is sterile and nonpyrogenic.</p><p>Vinorelbine tartrate, USP is a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid with antitumor activity. The chemical name is 3',4'-didehydro-4'-deoxy-<span class="Italics">C</span>'-norvincaleukoblastine [<span class="Italics">R</span>-(<span class="Italics">R*</span>,<span class="Italics">R*</span>)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1:2)(salt)]. Vinorelbine tartrate, USP has the following structure:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">45</span>H<span class="Sub">54</span>N<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">8</span>•2C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span> M.W. 1079.12</p><p>Vinorelbine tartrate, USP is a white to yellow or light brown amorphous powder. The aqueous solubility is &gt;1000 mg/mL in distilled water. The pH of vinorelbine injection USP is approximately 3.5.</p><h2>Vinorelbine, Concentrate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Vinorelbine is a vinca alkaloid that interferes with microtubule assembly. The antitumor activity of vinorelbine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin.  Vinorelbine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca++-transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. Vinorelbine inhibited mitotic microtubule formation in intact mouse embryo tectal plates at a concentration of 2 μM inducing a blockade of cells at metaphase, but produced depolymerization of axonal microtubules at a concentration 40 μM, suggesting a modest selectivity of vinorelbine for mitotic microtubules.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine were studied in 49 patients who received doses of 30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> administered as 15- to 20-minute constant-rate infusions. Vinorelbine concentrations in plasma decay in a triphasic manner. The terminal phase half-life averages 27.7 to 43.6 hours and the mean plasma clearance ranges from 0.97 to 1.26 L/hr/kg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Steady-state volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">SS</span>) values range from 25.4 to 40.1 L/kg. Vinorelbine demonstrated high binding to human platelets and lymphocytes. The free fraction was approximately 0.11 in human plasma over a concentration range of 234 to 1169 ng/mL. The binding to plasma constituents in cancer patients ranged from 79.6% to 91.2%. Vinorelbine binding was not altered in the presence of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, or doxorubicin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Vinorelbine undergoes substantial hepatic elimination in humans, with large amounts recovered in feces. Two metabolites of vinorelbine have been identified in human blood, plasma, and urine; vinorelbine N-oxide and deacetylvinorelbine. Deacetylvinorelbine has been demonstrated to be the primary metabolite of vinorelbine in humans, and has been shown to possess antitumor activity similar to vinorelbine. Therapeutic doses of vinorelbine (30 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) yield very small, if any, quantifiable levels of either metabolite in blood or urine. The metabolism of vinorelbine is mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>After intravenous administration of radioactive vinorelbine, approximately 18% and 46% of administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. In a different study, 10.9% <span class="Bold">+</span> 0.7% of a 30-mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> intravenous dose was excreted as parent drug in urine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Elderly: Age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics (CL, V<span class="Sub">SS</span> and t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of vinorelbine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine are not influenced by the concurrent administration of cisplatin.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">The carcinogenic potential of vinorelbine has not been studied. Vinorelbine has been shown to affect chromosome number and possibly structure <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (polyploidy in bone marrow cells from Chinese hamsters and a positive micronucleus test in mice). It was not mutagenic in the Ames test and gave inconclusive results in the mouse lymphoma TK Locus assay.</p><p>Vinorelbine did not affect fertility to a statistically significant extent when administered to rats on either a once-weekly (9 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, approximately one third the human dose) or alternate-day schedule (4.2 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, approximately 0.14 times the human recommended dose) prior to and during mating. In male rats, administration of vinorelbine twice weekly for 13 or 26 weeks at dose levels of 2.1 and 7.2 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (approximately 0.07 and 0.24 times the recommended human  dose), respectively, resulted in decreased spermatogenesis and prostate/seminal vesicle secretion.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Combination Use with Cisplatin</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin was evaluated in two randomized, multicenter trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cisplatin 100 mg/m</span><span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>Study 1 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of vinorelbine plus cisplatin and cisplatin alone for the treatment of stage IV or stage IIIb NSCLC patients with malignant pleural effusion or multiple lesions in more than one lobe of the ipsilateral lung who had not received prior chemotherapy.
