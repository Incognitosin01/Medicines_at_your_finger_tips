Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Take all of your HIV medicines as directed to control your infection.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry. This is to track the outcome of the pregnancy and to evaluate any effects of nelfinavir on the baby.</p><p>Nelfinavir can make birth control pills less effective. Ask your doctor about using non hormonal birth control (condom, diaphragm with spermicide) to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>You should not breast-feed while you are using nelfinavir. Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast-feed at all. Even if your baby is born without HIV, you may still pass the virus to the baby in your breast milk.</p><p>Nelfinavir is not approved for use by anyone younger than 2 years old.</p><h2>How should I take nelfinavir?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take  nelfinavir in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Nelfinavir works best if you take it with food.</p><p>Swallow the nelfinavir tablet whole.</p><p>If you cannot swallow a whole <b>tablet</b>, dissolve it in a small amount of water. Stir this mixture and drink all of it right away. To make sure you get the entire dose, add a little more water to the same glass, swirl gently and drink right away.</p><p>If a child is using this medicine, tell your doctor if the child has any changes in weight. Nelfinavir doses are based on weight in children, and any changes may affect your child's dose.</p><p>Use nelfinavir regularly to get the most benefit. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><p>HIV/AIDS is usually treated with a combination of drugs. Use all medications as directed by your doctor. Read the medication guide or patient instructions provided with each medication. Do not change your doses or medication schedule without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV or AIDS should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>While using nelfinavir, you may need frequent blood tests.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking nelfinavir?</h2><p>If you also take didanosine, take it 1 hour before or 2 hours after you take nelfinavir.</p><p>Taking  nelfinavir will not prevent you from passing HIV to other people. Do not have unprotected sex or share razors or toothbrushes. Talk with your doctor about safe ways to prevent HIV transmission during sex. Sharing drug or medicine needles is never safe, even for a healthy person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Nelfinavir side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
