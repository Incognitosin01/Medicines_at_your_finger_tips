Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can occur if you skip a meal, exercise too long, drink alcohol, or are under stress. Symptoms include headache, hunger, weakness, sweating, tremor, irritability, or trouble concentrating. Carry hard candy or glucose tablets with you in case you have low blood sugar. Other sugar sources include orange juice and milk. Be sure your family and close friends know how to help you in an emergency.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use glyburide if you are allergic to it, or if:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>you are being treated with bosentan (Tracleer);</p>
</li>

<p>you have type 1 diabetes; or</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>hemolytic anemia (a lack of red blood cells);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an enzyme deficiency called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD);</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul><p>hemolytic anemia (a lack of red blood cells);</p><p>an enzyme deficiency called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD);</p><p>a nerve disorder affecting bodily functions;</p><p>liver or kidney disease; or</p><p>an allergy to sulfa drugs.</p><p>Before taking glyburide, tell your doctor if you have taken another oral diabetes medicine or used insulin during the past 2 weeks.</p><p>Glyburide may increase your risk of serious heart problems, but not treating your diabetes can also damage your heart and other organs. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of this medicine.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about using glyburide <b>if you are pregnant or you become pregnant.</b> Controlling diabetes is very important during pregnancy, and having high blood sugar may cause complications in both the mother and the baby.</p><h2>How should I take glyburide?</h2><p>Glyburide is usually taken with breakfast or the first main meal of the day.</p><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Your blood sugar may need to be checked often, and you may need other blood tests at your doctor's office.</p><p>Low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> can happen to anyone who has diabetes. Symptoms include headache, hunger, sweating, irritability, dizziness, nausea, fast heart rate, and feeling anxious or shaky. To quickly treat low blood sugar, always keep a fast-acting source of sugar with you such as fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda.</p><p>Your doctor can prescribe a glucagon emergency injection kit to use in case you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink. Be sure your family and close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>If your doctor changes your brand, strength, or type of glyburide, your dosage needs may change. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the new kind of glyburide you receive at the pharmacy.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. <b>Do not</b> take two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A glyburide overdose can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia.</b></p><p>Symptoms of severe hypoglycemia include extreme weakness, nausea, tremors, sweating, confusion, trouble speaking, fast heartbeats, or seizure.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>Avoid drinking alcohol.

<br/>
TRANSFER FROM OTHER HYPOGLYCEMIC THERAPY:<br/>
-Oral Antidiabetic Therapy: No exact dosage relationships exists between standard glyburide, micronized glyburide, or other oral hypoglycemic agents; when transferring patients from other oral hypoglycemic therapy, the maximum starting doses should be observed.<br/>
