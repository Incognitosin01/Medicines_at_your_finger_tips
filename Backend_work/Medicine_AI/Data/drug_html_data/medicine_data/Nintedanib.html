The scar tissue thickens and becomes stiff over time, which can make it harder for your lungs to work. Decreased lung function can make it hard for you to breathe. Other medical problems can occur when your brain, heart, and other organs do not get enough oxygen.</p><p>Nintedanib is used to treat a lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).</p><p>Nintedanib is also used to treat chronic (long lasting) interstitial lung disease in which the scar tissue keeps getting worse.</p><p>Nintedanib is also used to slow the decline in lung function in people with a disorder called systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (sometimes called scleroderma-associated ILD).</p><p>Nintedanib is not a cure for IPF or ILD, but  nintedanib can slow the effects of these diseases on your lungs.</p><p>Nintedanib may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Nintedanib can cause birth defects or death in an unborn a baby.</b> Avoid getting pregnant while you are using this medicine and for at least 3 months after your last dose.
