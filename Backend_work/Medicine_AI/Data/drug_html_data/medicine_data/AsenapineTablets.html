</ul><h2>Asenapine Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Asenapine is a sublingual tablet. To ensure optimal absorption, patients should be instructed to place the tablet under the tongue and allow it to dissolve completely. The tablet will dissolve in saliva within seconds. Asenapine sublingual tablets should not be split, crushed, chewed, or swallowed <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Patients should be instructed to not eat or drink for 10 minutes after administration <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of asenapine sublingual tablets is 5 mg given twice daily. In short-term controlled trials, there was no suggestion of added benefit with a 10 mg twice daily dose, but there was a clear increase in certain adverse reactions. If tolerated, daily dosage can be increased to 10 mg twice daily after one week. The safety of doses above 10 mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span></p><h3>Bipolar I Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics XmChange">Acute Treatment of Manic or Mixed Episodes:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Monotherapy in Adults</span>:</span> The recommended starting and treatment dose of asenapine sublingual tablets is 5 mg to 10 mg twice daily. The safety of doses above 10 mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Monotherapy in Pediatric Patients:</span></span> The recommended dose of asenapine sublingual tablets are 2.5 mg to 10 mg twice daily in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age, and dose may be adjusted for individual response and tolerability. The starting dose of asenapine sublingual tablets is 2.5 mg twice daily. After 3 days, the dose can be increased to 5 mg twice daily, and from 5 mg to 10 mg twice daily after 3 additional days. Pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years appear to be more sensitive to dystonia with initial dosing with asenapine sublingual tablets when the recommended escalation schedule is not followed <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>. The safety of doses greater than 10 mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Adjunctive Therapy in Adults:</span></span> The recommended starting dose of asenapine sublingual tablets is 5 mg twice daily when administered as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate. Depending on the clinical response and tolerability in the individual patient, the dose can be increased to 10 mg twice daily. The safety of doses above 10 mg twice daily as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate has not been evaluated in clinical trials.</p><p>For patients on asenapine sublingual tablets, whether used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate, it is generally recommended that responding patients continue treatment beyond the acute episode.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Monotherapy in Adults: Continue on the asenapine sublingual tabletsdose that the patient received during stabilization (5 mg to 10 mg twice daily). Depending on the clinical response and tolerability in the individual patient, a dose of 10 mg twice daily can be decreased to 5 mg twice daily. The safety of doses above 10 mg twice daily has not been evaluated in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

<li>Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) <span class="Italics">[see Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">A history of hypersensitivity reactions to asenapine. Reactions have included anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, swollen tongue, dyspnea, wheezing and rash <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6)].</span></span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Asenapine sublingual tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></span></p><h3>Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, In Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">In placebo-controlled trials in elderly subjects with dementia, patients randomized to risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine had a higher incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack, including fatal stroke. Asenapine sublingual tablets are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue asenapine sublingual tablets and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring.</span></p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including asenapine sublingual tablets. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">There is no known treatment for tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Given these considerations, asenapine sublingual tablets should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">If signs and symptoms of TD appear in a patient on asenapine sublingual tablets, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with asenapine sublingual tablets despite the presence of the syndrome.</span></p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including asenapine sublingual tablets, have caused metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. Although all of the drugs in the class to date have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets. Assess fasting plasma glucose before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medication, and monitor periodically during long-term treatment.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Italics">Adult Patients:</span> Pooled data from the short-term placebo-controlled schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 1.</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In a 52-week, double-blind, comparator-controlled trial that included primarily patients with schizophrenia, the mean increase from baseline of fasting glucose was 2.4 mg/dL.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients:</span> Data from the short-term, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients with bipolar I disorder are shown in <span class="Bold">Table 2</span>.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Dyslipidemia</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Atypical antipsychotics cause adverse alterations in lipids. Before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medication, obtain a fasting lipid profile at baseline and monitor periodically during treatment.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Italics">Adult Patients:</span> Pooled data from the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 3.</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In short-term schizophrenia trials, the proportion of patients with total cholesterol elevations ≥240 mg/dL (at Endpoint) was 8.3% for asenapine sublingual tablets-treated patients versus 7% for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients with elevations in triglycerides ≥200 mg/dL (at Endpoint) was 13.2% for asenapine sublingual tablets-treated patients versus 10.5% for placebo-treated patients. In short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar mania trials, the proportion of patients with total cholesterol elevations ≥240 mg/dL (at Endpoint) was 7.8% for asenapine sublingual tablets-treated patients versus 7.9% for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients with elevations in triglycerides ≥200 mg/dL (at Endpoint) was 13.1% for asenapine sublingual tablets-treated patients versus 8.6% for placebo-treated patients.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients:</span> Data from the short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar mania trial are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 4</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Weight Gain</span></p><p>Weight gain has been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including asenapine sublingual tabelts. Monitor weight at baseline and frequently thereafter.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adult Patients:</span> Pooled data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of subjects meeting a weight gain criterion of ≥7% of body weight from the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 5.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adult Patients:</span> In a 52-week, double-blind, comparator-controlled adult trial that included primarily patients with schizophrenia, the mean weight gain from baseline was 0.9 kg. The proportion of patients with a ≥7% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 14.7%. <span class="Bold">Table 6</span> provides the mean weight change from baseline and the proportion of patients with a weight gain of ≥7% categorized by Body Mass Index (BMI) at baseline.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients:</span> Data on mean changes in body weight and the proportion of pediatric patients meeting a weight gain criterion of ≥7% of body weight from the short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar mania trial are presented in <span class="Bold">Table 7</span>. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for the natural growth of pediatric patients by comparisons to age-and sex-matched population standards.</p><p>The distance of a z-score from 0 represents the distance of a percentile from the median, measured in standard deviations (SD). After adjusting for age and sex, the mean change from baseline to endpoint in weight z-score for asenapine sublingual tablets 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, was 0.11, 0.08 and 0.09 SD versus 0.02 SD for placebo, respectively.</p><p>When treating pediatric patients, weight gain should be monitored and assessed against that expected for normal growth.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets. In several cases, these reactions occurred after the first dose. These hypersensitivity reactions included: anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, swollen tongue, dyspnea, wheezing and rash.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension, Syncope, and Other Hemodynamic Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Atypical antipsychotics cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Generally, the risk is greatest during initial dose titration and when increasing the dose. In short-term schizophrenia adult trials, syncope was reported in 0.2% (1/572) of patients treated with therapeutic doses (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) of asenapine sublingual tablets, compared to 0.3% (1/378) of patients treated with placebo. In short-term bipolar mania adult trials, syncope was reported in 0.2% (1/620) of patients treated with therapeutic doses (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) of asenapine sublingual tablets, compared to 0% (0/329) of patients treated with placebo. During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with asenapine sublingual tablets, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, syncope was reported in 0.6% (11/1,953) of patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets. In a 3-week, bipolar mania pediatric trial, syncope was reported in 1% (1/104) of patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets 2.5 mg twice daily, 1% (1/99) of patients treated with asenapine 5 mg twice daily, and 0% (0/99) for patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets 10 mg twice daily compared to 0% (0/101) for patients treated with placebo.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Orthostatic vital signs should be monitored in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension (elderly patients, patients with dehydration, hypovolemia, concomitant treatment with antihypertensive medications, patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), and patients with cerebrovascular disease. Asenapine sublingual tablets should be used cautiously when treating patients who receive treatment with other drugs that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in all such patients, and a dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs.</span></p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Asenapine sublingual tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.</span></p><h3>Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="First">In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including asenapine sublingual tablets. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC or ANC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of asenapine sublingual tablets at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.</span></p><p>Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue asenapine sublingual tablets in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) and follow their WBC until recovery.</p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The effects of asenapine sublingual tablets on the QT/QTc interval were evaluated in a dedicated adult QT study. This trial involved asenapine sublingual tablets doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg twice daily, and placebo, and was conducted in 151 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia, with electrocardiographic assessments throughout the dosing interval at baseline and steady state. At these doses, asenapine sublingual tablets was associated with increases in QTc interval ranging from 2 to 5 msec compared to placebo. No patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets experienced QTc increases ≥60 msec from baseline measurements, nor did any patient experience a QTc of ≥500 msec.</span></p><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were taken at various time points during the asenapine sublingual tablets clinical trial program (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily doses). Post-baseline QT prolongations exceeding 500 msec were reported at comparable rates for asenapine sublingual tablets and placebo in these short-term trials. There were no reports of Torsade de Pointes or any other adverse reactions associated with delayed ventricular repolarization.</p><p>The use of asenapine sublingual tablets should be avoided in combination with other drugs known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin). Asenapine sublingual tablets should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias and in other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including bradycardia; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; and presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.</p><h3>Hyperprolactinemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors, asenapine sublingual tablets can elevate prolactin levels, and the elevation can persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. In asenapine sublingual tablets adult pre-marketing clinical trials, the incidences of adverse events related to abnormal prolactin levels were 0.4% versus 0% for placebo. In a 3-week, bipolar mania pediatric trial, the incidence of adverse events related to abnormal prolactin levels were 0% in the asenapine sublingual tablets 2.5 mg twice daily treatment group, 2% in the asenapine sublingual tablets 5 mg twice daily treatment group, and 1% in the asenapine sublingual tablets 10 mg twice daily treatment group versus to 1% for patients treated with placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></span></p><p>Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously-detected breast cancer. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Seizures were reported in 0% and 0.3% (0/572,1/379) of adult patients treated with doses of 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily of asenapine sublingual tablets, respectively, compared to 0% (0/503, 0/203) of patients treated with placebo in pre-marketing short-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials, respectively. During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with asenapine sublingual tablets, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, seizures were reported in 0.3% (5/1,953) of patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets. There were no reports of seizures in pediatric patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets in a 3-week-term, bipolar mania trial.</span></p><p>As with other antipsychotic drugs, asenapine sublingual tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.</p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Somnolence was reported in patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets. It was usually transient with the highest incidence reported during the first week of treatment. In short-term, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled schizophrenia adult trials, somnolence was reported in 15% (41/274) of patients on asenapine sublingual tablets 5 mg twice daily and in 13% (26/208) of patients on asenapine sublingual tablets 10 mg twice daily compared to 7% (26/378) of placebo patients. In short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar mania adult trials of therapeutic doses (5-10 mg twice daily), somnolence was reported in 23% (145/620) of patients on asenapine sublingual tablets compared to 5% (18/329) of placebo patients. In the 3-week fixed-dose study, somnolence occurred at a lower rate in the 5mg twice daily dose 20% (24/122) versus the 10mg twice daily dose 26% (31/119) compared to 4% (5/126) in placebo patients. During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with asenapine sublingual tablets, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, somnolence was reported in 18% (358/1,953) of patients treated with asenapine sublingual tablets. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.6% (12/1,953) of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled trials.</span></p><p>In a 3-week, placebo-controlled, bipolar I pediatric trial, the incidence of somnolence (including sedation and hypersomnia) for placebo, asenapine sublingual tablets 2.5 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and 10 mg twice daily, was 12% (12/101), 46% (48/104), 53% (52/99), and 49% (49/99), respectively. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0%, 3%, 1%, and 2% of patients treated with placebo, and asenapine sublingual tablets 2.5 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that asenapine sublingual tablets therapy does not affect them adversely.</span></p><h3>Body Temperature Regulation</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Atypical antipsychotics may disrupt the body's ability to reduce core body temperature. In the pre-marketing short-term placebo-controlled trials for both schizophrenia and acute bipolar I disorder, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of body temperature increases was low (≤1%) and comparable to placebo (0%). During pre-marketing clinical trials with asenapine sublingual tablets, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of body temperature increases (pyrexia and feeling hot) was ≤1%.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, dehydration, and anticholinergic medications may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature; use asenapine sublingual tablets with caution in patient who may experience these conditions.</span></p><h3>Dysphagia</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Dysphagia has been reported with asenapine sublingual tablets. Asenapine sublingual tablets and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration.</span></p><h3>Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine 0.17 mg per tablet.</p><p>Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Asenapine sublingual tablets contain phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablet contains 0.17 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing asenapine sublingual tablets in a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including asenapine sublingual tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

The effect of renal function on the excretion of other metabolites and the effect of dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of asenapine has not been studied.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Asenapine sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) because asenapine exposure is 7-fold higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment than the exposure observed in subjects with normal hepatic function.</p><p>No dosage adjustment for asenapine sublingual tablets are required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A and B) because asenapine exposure is similar to that in subjects with normal hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Other Specific Populations</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment for asenapine sublingual tablets are required on the basis of a patient's sex, race (Caucasian and Japanese), or smoking status <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Asenapine sublingual tablets are not a controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Asenapine sublingual tablets have not been systematically studied in animals or humans for their abuse potential or their ability to induce tolerance or physical dependence. Thus, it is not possible to predict the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted and/or abused once it is marketed. Patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed carefully for signs that they are misusing or abusing asenapine sublingual tablets (e.g., drug-seeking behavior, increases in dose).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Human Experience:</span> In adult pre-marketing clinical studies involving more than 3,350 patients and/or healthy subjects, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of asenapine sublingual tablets was identified in 3 patients. Among these few reported cases of overdose, the highest estimated ingestion of asenapine sublingual tablets was 400 mg. Reported adverse reactions at the highest dosage included agitation and confusion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Management of Overdosage:</span> There is no specific antidote to asenapine sublingual tablets. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. An electrocardiogram should be obtained and management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date guidance and advice on the management of overdosage (1-800-222-1222.)</p><p>Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures, such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of asenapine sublingual tablets-induced alpha blockade). In case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.</p><h2>Asenapine Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Asenapine sublingual tablets contain asenapine maleate which is an atypical antipsychotic that is available for sublingual administration. Asenapine belongs to the class dibenzo-oxepino pyrroles. The chemical designation is(3a<span class="Italics">RS</span>,12b<span class="Italics">RS</span>)-5­Chloro-2-methyl-2,3,3a,12b-tetrahydro-1<span class="Italics">H</span>dibenzo[2,3:6,7]oxepino[4,5-<span class="Italics">c</span>]pyrrole(2<span class="Italics">Z</span>)-2-butenedioate (1:1).

The chemical structure is:</p><p></p><p>Asenapine maleate is a white to off-white powder.</p><p>Asenapine sublingual tablets (Unflavored) are supplied for sublingual administration in tablets containing 10 mg asenapine; inactive ingredients include aspartame, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and povidone.</p><p>Asenapine sublingual tablets, black cherry flavor, are supplied for sublingual administration in tablets containing 2.5 mg or 10 mg asenapine; inactive ingredients include aspartame, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and povidone and black cherry flavor (components are nature identical flavorings, natural flavoring substances, natural flavoring complexes, maize maltodextrin and moisture).</p><h2>Asenapine Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of asenapine in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder, is unknown. It has been suggested that the efficacy of asenapine in schizophrenia could be mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at D<span class="Sub">2</span> and 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> receptors.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Asenapine exhibits high affinity for serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2B</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2C</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">5A</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">6</span>, and 5-HT<span class="Sub">7</span> receptors (Ki values of 2.5, 2.7, 0.07, 0.18, 0.03, 1.6, 0.25, and 0.11 nM, respectively), dopamine D<span class="Sub">2A</span>, D<span class="Sub">2B</span>, D<span class="Sub">3</span>, D<span class="Sub">4</span>, and D<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors (Ki values of 1.3, 1.4, 0.42, 1.1, and 1.4 nM, respectively), α<span class="Sub">1A</span>, α<span class="Sub">2A</span>, α<span class="Sub">2B</span>, and α<span class="Sub">2C</span>-adrenergic receptors (Ki values of 1.2, 1.2, 0.33 and 1.2 nM, respectively), and histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors (Ki value 1.0 nM), and moderate affinity for H<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors (Ki value of 6.2 nM). In <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays asenapine acts as an antagonist at these receptors. Asenapine has no appreciable affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors (e.g., Ki value of 8,128 nM for M<span class="Sub">1</span>).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following a single 5 mg dose of asenapine sublingual tablets, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was approximately 4 ng/mL and was observed at a mean t<span class="Sub">max</span> of 1 hour. Elimination of asenapine is primarily through direct glucuronidation by UGT1A4 and oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (predominantly CYP1A2). Following an initial more rapid distribution phase, the mean terminal half-life is approximately 24 hrs. With multiple-dose twice-daily dosing, steady-state is attained within 3 days. Overall, steady-state asenapine pharmacokinetics are similar to single-dose pharmacokinetics.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span> Following sublingual administration, asenapine is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 0.5 to 1.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of sublingual asenapine at 5 mg is 35%. Increasing the dose from 5 mg to 10 mg twice daily (a two-fold increase) results in less than linear (1.7 times) increases in both the extent of exposure and maximum concentration. The absolute bioavailability of asenapine when swallowed is low (&lt;2% with an oral tablet formulation).</p><p>The intake of water several (2 or 5) minutes after asenapine administration resulted in decreased asenapine exposure. Therefore, eating and drinking should be avoided for 10 minutes after administration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span> Asenapine is rapidly distributed and has a large volume of distribution (approximately 20 - 25 L/kg), indicating extensive extravascular distribution. Asenapine is highly bound (95%) to plasma proteins, including albumin and α<span class="Sub">1</span>-acid glycoprotein.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination:</span> Direct glucuronidation by UGT1A4 and oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (predominantly CYP1A2) are the primary metabolic pathways for asenapine.</p><p>Asenapine is a high clearance drug with a clearance after intravenous administration of 52 L/h. In this circumstance, hepatic clearance is influenced primarily by changes in liver blood flow rather than by changes in the intrinsic clearance, i.e., the metabolizing enzymatic activity. Following an initial more rapid distribution phase, the terminal half-life of asenapine is approximately 24 hours. Steady-state concentrations of asenapine are reached within 3 days of twice daily dosing.</p><p>After administration of a single dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-labeled asenapine, about 90% of the dose was recovered; approximately 50% was recovered in urine, and 40% recovered in feces. About 50% of the circulating species in plasma have been identified. The predominant species was asenapine N<span class="Sup">+</span>-glucuronide; others included N-desmethylasenapine, N-desmethylasenapine N-carbamoyl glucuronide, and unchanged asenapine in smaller amounts. Asenapine activity is primarily due to the parent drug.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that asenapine is a substrate for UGT1A4, CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Asenapine is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Asenapine does not cause induction of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 activities in cultured human hepatocytes. Coadministration of asenapine with known inhibitors, inducers or substrates of these metabolic pathways has been studied in a number of drug-drug interaction studies <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Food:</span> A crossover study in 26 healthy adult male subjects was performed to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a single 5 mg dose of asenapine. Consumption of food immediately prior to sublingual administration decreased asenapine exposure by 20%; consumption of food 4 hours after sublingual administration decreased asenapine exposure by about 10%. These effects are probably due to increased hepatic blood flow.</p><p>In clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of asenapine sublingual tablets, patients were instructed to avoid eating for 10 minutes following sublingual dosing. There were no other restrictions with regard to the timing of meals in these trials <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Water:</span> In clinical trials establishing the efficacy and safety of asenapine sublingual tablets, patients were instructed to avoid drinking for 10 minutes following sublingual dosing. The effect of water administration following 10 mg sublingual asenapine sublingual tablets dosing was studied at different time points of 2, 5, 10, and 30 minutes in 15 healthy adult male subjects. The exposure of asenapine following administration of water 10 minutes after sublingual dosing was equivalent to that when water was administered 30 minutes after dosing. Reduced exposure to asenapine was observed following water administration at 2 minutes (19% decrease) and 5 minutes (10% decrease) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies:</span></p><p>Effects of other drugs on the exposure of asenapine are summarized in Figure 1. In addition, a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the concomitant administration of lithium had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of asenapine.</p><p>The effects of asenapine on the pharmacokinetics of other co-administered drugs are summarized in Figure 2. Coadministration of paroxetine with asenapine sublingual tablets caused a two-fold increase in the maximum plasma concentrations and systemic exposure of paroxetine. Asenapine enhances the inhibitory effects of paroxetine on its own metabolism by CYP2D6.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Studies in Special Populations:</span></p><p>Exposures of asenapine in special populations are summarized in Figure 3. Additionally, based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, no effects of sex, race, BMI, and smoking status on asenapine exposure were observed. Exposure in elderly patients is 30-40% higher as compared to adults.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Carcinogenesis:</span> In a lifetime carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice asenapine was administered subcutaneously at doses up to those resulting in plasma levels (AUC) estimated to be 5 times those in humans receiving the MRHD of 10 mg twice daily. The incidence of malignant lymphomas was increased in female mice, with a no-effect dose resulting in plasma levels estimated to be 1.5 times those in humans receiving the MRHD. The mouse strain used has a high and variable incidence of malignant lymphomas, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown. There were no increases in other tumor types in female mice. In male mice, there were no increases in any tumor type.</p><p>In a lifetime carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, asenapine did not cause any increases in tumors when administered subcutaneously at doses up to those resulting in plasma levels (AUC) estimated to be 5 times those in humans receiving the MRHD.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Mutagenesis:</span> No evidence for genotoxic potential of asenapine was found in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial reverse mutation assay, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> sister chromatid exchange assay in rabbit lymphocytes, or the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus assay in rats.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Impairment of Fertility:</span> Asenapine did not impair fertility in rats when tested at doses up to 11 mg/kg twice daily given orally. This dose is 10 times the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg twice daily given sublingually on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Efficacy of asenapine sublingual tablets was established in the following trials:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Schizophrenia</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of asenapine sublingual tablets in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults was evaluated in three fixed-dose, short-term (6 week), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled (haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine) trials of adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and were having an acute exacerbation of their schizophrenic illness. In two of the three trials asenapine sublingual tablets demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo. In a third trial, asenapine sublingual tablets could not be distinguished from placebo; however, an active control in that trial was superior to placebo.</p><p>In the two positive trials for asenapine sublingual tablets, the primary efficacy rating scale was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30 item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to endpoint on the PANSS total score. The results of the asenapine sublingual tablets trials in schizophrenia follow:</p><p>In trial 1, a 6-week trial (n=174), comparing asenapine sublingual tablets (5 mg twice daily) to placebo, asenapine sublingual tablets 5 mg twice daily was statistically superior to placebo on the PANSS total score (Trial 1 in Table 13).</p><p>In trial 2, a 6-week trial (n=448), comparing two fixed doses of asenapine sublingual tablets (5 mg and 10 mg twice daily) to placebo, asenapine sublingual tablets 5 mg twice daily was statistically superior to placebo on the PANSS total score. Asenapine sublingual tablets 10 mg twice daily showed no added benefit compared to 5 mg twice daily and was not significantly different from placebo (Trial 2 in Table 13).</p><p>An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, sex or race.</p><p>Maintenance of efficacy has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily based on tolerability) clinical trial with a randomized withdrawal design. All patients were initially administered 5 mg twice daily for 1 week and then titrated up to 10 mg twice daily. A total of 700 patients entered open-label treatment with asenapine sublingual tablets for a period of 26 weeks. Of these, a total of 386 patients who met pre-specified criteria for continued stability (mean length of stabilization was 22 weeks) were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal phase. Asenapine sublingual tablets was statistically superior to placebo in time to relapse or impending relapse defined as increase in PANSS ≥20% from baseline and a Clinical Global Impression–Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score ≥4 (at least 2 days within 1 week) or PANSS score ≥5 on "hostility" or "uncooperativeness" items and CGI-S score ≥4 (≥2 days within a week), or PANSS score ≥5 on any two of the following items: "unusual thought content," "conceptual disorganization," or "hallucinatory behavior" items, and CGI-S score ≥4 (≥2 days within 1 week) or investigator judgment of worsening symptoms or increased risk of violence to self (including suicide) or other persons. The Kaplan-Meier curves of the time to relapse or impending relapse during the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal phase of this trial for asenapine sublingual tablets and placebo are shown in Figure 4.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Estimation of Percent Relapse/Impending Relapse for Asenapine Sublingual Tablets and placebo</span></p><p></p><h3>Bipolar I Disorder</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Monotherapy</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> The efficacy of asenapine sublingual tablets in the treatment of acute mania was established in two similarly designed 3-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and active-controlled (olanzapine) trials of adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with an acute manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features.</p><p>The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). Patients were also assessed on the Clinical Global Impression – Bipolar (CGI-BP) scale. In both trials, all patients randomized to asenapine sublingual tablets were initially administered 10 mg twice daily, and the dose could be adjusted within the dose range of 5 to 10 mg twice daily from Day 2 onward based on efficacy and tolerability. Ninety percent of patients remained on the 10 mg twice daily dose. Asenapine sublingual tablets was statistically superior to placebo on the YMRS total score and the CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania) in both studies (Trials 1 and 2 in Table 14).</p><p>In another 3-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (n=359), comparing two fixed doses of asenapine sublingual tablets (5 mg and 10 mg twice daily) to placebo, both doses were statistically superior to placebo on the YMRS total score and CGI-BP Severity of Illness overall score. (Trial 3 in Table 14).</p><p>An examination of subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, sex, or race.</p><p>Maintenance of efficacy has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily based on tolerability) clinical trial with a randomized withdrawal design. All patients were initially administered 5 or 10 mg twice daily, and the option to titrate down to 5 mg twice daily was provided based on tolerability. A total of 549 patients entered open-label treatment with asenapine sublingual tablets for a period of 12 to16 weeks. Of these, a total of 252 patients who met pre-specified criteria for continued stability were randomized to and treated in a double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized withdrawal phase. Asenapine sublingual tablets was statistically superior to placebo in time to relapse defined as 1) YMRS or MADRS score ≥ 16; 2) requirement or initiation of any non-study medication to treat mixed, manic, or depressive symptoms, including an antipsychotic, antidepressant, or mood-stabilizing agent; 3) requirement or initiation of psychiatric hospitalization; 4) investigator judgment to discontinue the study due to a mood event. The Kaplan-Meier curves of the time to relapse during the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal phase of this trial for asenapine sublingual tablets and placebo are shown in Figure 5.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pediatric patients:</span> The efficacy of asenapine sublingual tablets in the treatment of acute mania was established in a single, 3-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 403 pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age, of whom 302 patients received asenapine sublingual tablets at fixed doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily. All patients were started on 2.5 mg twice daily. For those assigned to 5 mg twice daily, the dose was increased to 5 mg twice daily after 3 days. For those assigned to 10 mg twice daily, the dose was increased from 2.5 to 5 mg twice daily after 3 days, and then to 10 mg twice daily after 3 additional days.</p><p>Asenapine sublingual tablets was statistically superior to placebo in improving YMRS total score and the CGI-BP Severity of Illness overall score as measured by the change from baseline to week 3 (Trial 3 Pediatric in Table 14).

All patients randomized to asenapine sublingual tablets were initially administered 5 mg twice daily, and the dose could be adjusted within the dose range of 5 to 10 mg twice daily from Day 2 onward based on efficacy and tolerability. Asenapine was statistically superior to placebo in the reduction of manic symptoms (measured by the YMRS total score) as an adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate monotherapy at Week 3 (Trial 5 Adjunctive in Table 14).</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Asenapine sublingual tablets are supplied as:</p><p><span class="Bold">10 mg Tablets</span></p><p>Round, white, uncoated tablets debossed "B" on one side and "2" on the other side.</p><p><span class="Bold">2.5 mg Tablets, black cherry flavor</span></p><p>White colored, round shaped, uncoated tablets debossed with "B" on one side and "5" on the other side.</p><p><span class="Bold">10 mg Tablets, black cherry flavor</span></p><p>Round, white, uncoated tablets debossed "B" on one side and "4" on the other side.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].</span></p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Instructions for Use).</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration</span></p><p>Counsel patients on proper sublingual administration of asenapine sublingual tablets and advise them to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Instructions for Use).
