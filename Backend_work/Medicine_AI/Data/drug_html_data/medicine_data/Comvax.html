</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Comvax</h2><p>Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine is a combination immunizing agent that is used to prevent infection caused by the <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b (Hib) bacteria and hepatitis B virus. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.</p><p>Infections with <i>Haemophilus influenza</i> type b (Hib) bacteria can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningitis (a brain disease), epiglottitis (a throat disease that can cause suffocation), pericarditis (a heart disease), pneumonia (a lung disease), and septic arthritis (a bone and joint disease). Hib meningitis may cause death or leave the child with serious and permanent damage, such as mental retardation, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness.</p><p>HBV infection is a major cause of serious liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, and a type of liver cancer called primary hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>Pregnant women who have hepatitis B infection or are carriers of hepatitis B virus can give the disease to their babies when they are born. These babies often suffer serious long-term illnesses from the disease.</p><p>Immunization against hepatitis B disease is recommended for all newborn babies, infants, and young children.</p><p>This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Comvax</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Comvax® vaccine in infants younger than 6 weeks and older than 15 months of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Comvax® vaccine is not recommended for adult or geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this vaccine.
