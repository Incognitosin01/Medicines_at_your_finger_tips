<li> <span class="Bold">Treatment of Gout Flares:</span></li>
</ul><p>Colchicine Tablets are indicated for treatment of acute gout flares when taken at the first sign of a flare.</p><h3>Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)</h3><p class="First">Colchicine Tablets are indicated in adults and children four years or older for treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).</p><h2>Colchicine Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The long-term use of colchicine is established for FMF and the prophylaxis of gout flares, but the safety and efficacy of repeat treatment for gout flares has not been evaluated. The dosing regimens for Colchicine Tablets are different for each indication and must be individualized.</p><p>The recommended dosage of Colchicine Tablets depends on the patient's age, renal function, hepatic function and use of coadministered drugs <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5, 2.6)].</span></p><p>Colchicine Tablets are administered orally without regard to meals.</p><p>Colchicine Tablets are not an analgesic medication and should not be used to treat pain from other causes.</p><h3>Gout Flares</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Prophylaxis of Gout Flares</span></span></p><p>The recommended dosage of Colchicine Tablets for prophylaxis of gout flares for adults and adolescents older than 16 years of age is 0.6 mg once or twice daily. The maximum recommended dose for prophylaxis of gout flares is 1.2 mg/day.</p><p>An increase in gout flares may occur after initiation of uric acid-lowering therapy, including pegloticase, febuxostat and allopurinol, due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Colchicine Tablets are recommended upon initiation of gout flare prophylaxis with uric acid-lowering therapy. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for at least the first six months of uric acid-lowering therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Treatment of Gout Flares</span></span></p><p>The recommended dose of Colchicine Tablets for treatment of a gout flare is 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Higher doses have not been found to be more effective. The maximum recommended dose for treatment of gout flares is 1.8 mg over a 1-hour period. Colchicine Tablets may be administered for treatment of a gout flare during prophylaxis at doses not to exceed 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Wait 12 hours and then resume the prophylactic dose.</p><h3>FMF</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Colchicine Tablets for FMF in adults is 1.2 mg to 2.4 mg daily.</p><p>Colchicine Tablets should be increased as needed to control disease and as tolerated in increments of 0.3 mg/day to a maximum recommended daily dose. If intolerable side effects develop, the dose should be decreased in increments of 0.3 mg/day. The total daily Colchicine Tablets dose may be administered in one to two divided doses.</p><h3>Recommended Pediatric Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Prophylaxis and Treatment of Gout Flares</span></span></p><p>Colchicine Tablets are not recommended for pediatric use in prophylaxis or treatment of gout flares.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">FMF</span></span></p><p>The recommended dosage of Colchicine Tablets for FMF in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older is based on age. The following daily doses may be given as a single or divided dose twice daily:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>  Children 4 to 6 years: 0.3 mg to 1.8 mg daily</li>
<li>  Children 6 to 12 years: 0.9 mg to 1.8 mg daily</li>

In these patients, life-threatening and fatal colchicine toxicity has been reported with colchicine taken in therapeutic doses.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Fatal Overdose</h3><p class="First">Fatal overdoses, both accidental and intentional, have been reported in adults and children who have ingested colchicine <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Colchicine should be kept out of the reach of children.</p><h3>Blood Dyscrasias</h3><p class="First">Myelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia and aplastic anemia have been reported with colchicine used in therapeutic doses.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Colchicine is a P-gp and CYP3A4 substrate. Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with colchicine given with P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If treatment with a P-gp or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is required in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the patient's dose of colchicine may need to be reduced or interrupted <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Use of colchicine in conjunction with P-gp or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (this includes all protease inhibitors except fosamprenavir) is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Neuromuscular Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Colchicine-induced neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with chronic treatment in therapeutic doses. Patients with renal dysfunction and elderly patients, even those with normal renal and hepatic function, are at increased risk.</p><p>Concomitant use of atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, fenofibric acid or benzafibrate (themselves associated with myotoxicity) or cyclosporine with colchicine may potentiate the development of myopathy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Once colchicine is stopped, the symptoms generally resolve within one week to several months.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Prophylaxis of Gout Flares</span></span></p><p>The most commonly reported adverse reaction in clinical trials of colchicine for the prophylaxis of gout was diarrhea.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Treatment of Gout Flares</span></span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported in the clinical trial with colchicine for treatment of gout flares were diarrhea (23%) and pharyngolaryngeal pain (3%).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">FMF</span></span></p><p>Gastrointestinal tract adverse effects are the most frequent side effects in patients initiating colchicine, usually presenting within 24 hours, and occurring in up to 20% of patients given therapeutic doses. Typical symptoms include cramping, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting. These events should be viewed as dose-limiting if severe, as they can herald the onset of more significant toxicity.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience in Gout</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.</p><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a gout flare, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients using the recommended dose (1.8 mg over one hour) of colchicine compared to 77% of patients taking a nonrecommended high dose (4.8 mg over six hours) of colchicine and 20% of patients taking placebo. Diarrhea was the most commonly reported drug-related gastrointestinal adverse event. As shown in Table 3, diarrhea is associated with colchicine treatment. Diarrhea was more likely to occur in patients taking the high-dose regimen than the low- dose regimen. Severe diarrhea occurred in 19% and vomiting occurred in 17% of patients taking the nonrecommended high-dose colchicine regimen but did not occur in the recommended low-dose colchicine regimen.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Serious toxic manifestations associated with colchicine include myelosuppression, disseminated intravascular coagulation and injury to cells in the renal, hepatic, circulatory and central nervous systems. These most often occur with excessive accumulation or overdosage <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified with colchicine. These have been generally reversible upon temporarily interrupting treatment or lowering the dose of colchicine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Neurological:</span></span> sensory motor neuropathy</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dermatological:</span></span> alopecia, maculopapular rash, purpura, rash</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Digestive:</span></span> abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, lactose intolerance, nausea, vomiting</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hematological:</span></span> leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary:</span></span> elevated AST, elevated ALT</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span></span> myopathy, elevated CPK, myotonia, muscle weakness, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reproductive:</span></span> azoospermia, oligospermia</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Colchicine is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Of the cytochrome P450 enzymes tested, CYP3A4 was mainly involved in the metabolism of colchicine. If colchicine is administered with drugs that inhibit P-gp, most of which also inhibit CYP3A4, increased concentrations of colchicine are likely. Fatal drug interactions have been reported.</p><p>Physicians should ensure that patients are suitable candidates for treatment with colchicine and remain alert for signs and symptoms of toxicities related to increased colchicine exposure as a result of a drug interaction. Signs and symptoms of colchicine toxicity should be evaluated promptly and, if toxicity is suspected, colchicine should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>Table 4 provides recommendations as a result of other potentially significant drug interactions. Table 1 provides recommendations for strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and P-gp inhibitors.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>Available data from published literature on colchicine use in pregnancy over several decades have not identified any drug associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> Colchicine crosses the human placenta. Although animal reproductive and developmental studies were not conducted with colchicine, published animal reproduction and development studies indicate that colchicine causes embryofetal toxicity, teratogenicity and altered postnatal development at exposures within or above the clinical therapeutic range.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects or miscarriage in pregnant women with rheumatic diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Behcet's disease, or familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) treated with colchicine at therapeutic doses during pregnancy. Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>Colchicine is present in human milk <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Adverse events in breastfed infants have not been reported in the published literature after administration of colchicine to lactating women. There are no data on the effects of colchicine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for colchicine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from colchicine or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Data</span></span></p><p>Limited published data from case reports and a small lactation study demonstrate that colchicine is present in breastmilk. A systematic review of literature reported no adverse effects in 149 breastfed children. In a prospective observational cohort study, no gastrointestinal or other symptoms were reported in 38 colchicine-exposed breastfed infants.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Infertility</span></span></p><p>Case reports and epidemiology studies in human male subjects on colchicine therapy indicated that infertility from colchicine is rare and may be reversible. A case report indicated that azoospermia was reversed when therapy was stopped. Case reports and epidemiology studies in female subjects on colchicine therapy have not established a clear relationship between colchicine use and female infertility. However, since the progression of FMF without treatment may result in infertility, the use of colchicine needs to be weighed against the potential risks <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of colchicine in children of all ages with FMF has been evaluated in uncontrolled studies. There does not appear to be an adverse effect on growth in children with FMF treated long-term with colchicine. Safety and effectiveness of colchicine in pediatric patients with gout has not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies with colchicine for prophylaxis and treatment of gout flares and for treatment of FMF did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient with gout should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased renal function, concomitant disease or other drug therapy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Colchicine is significantly excreted in urine in healthy subjects. Clearance of colchicine is decreased in patients with impaired renal function. Total body clearance of colchicine was reduced by 75% in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Prophylaxis of Gout Flares</span></span></p><p>For prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance Cl<span class="Sub">cr</span> 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min) to moderate (Cl<span class="Sub">cr</span> 30 mL/min to 50 mL/min) renal function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. However, in patients with severe impairment, the starting dose should be 0.3 mg per day and any increase in dose should be done with close monitoring.

However, in patients with severe impairment, while the dose does not need to be adjusted for the treatment of gout flares, a treatment course should be repeated no more than once every two weeks. For patients with gout flares requiring repeated courses, consideration should be given to alternate therapy. For patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended dose for the treatment of gout flares should be reduced to a single dose of 0.6 mg (one tablet).

Fatalities have occurred after ingestion of a dose as low as 7 mg over a four day period, while other patients have survived after ingesting more than 60 mg. A review of 150 patients who overdosed on colchicine found that those who ingested less than 0.5 mg/kg survived and tended to have milder toxicities such as gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas those who took 0.5 to 0.8 mg/kg had more severe reactions such as myelosuppression. There was 100% mortality in those who ingested more than 0.8 mg/kg.</p><p>The first stage of acute colchicine toxicity typically begins within 24 hours of ingestion and includes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and significant fluid loss, leading to volume depletion. Peripheral leukocytosis may also be seen. Life-threatening complications occur during the second stage, which occurs 24 to 72 hours after drug administration, attributed to multiorgan failure and its consequences. Death is usually a result of respiratory depression and cardiovascular collapse. If the patient survives, recovery of multiorgan injury may be accompanied by rebound leukocytosis and alopecia starting about one week after the initial ingestion.</p><p>Treatment of colchicine poisoning should begin with gastric lavage and measures to prevent shock. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic and supportive. No specific antidote is known. Colchicine is not effectively removed by dialysis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Colchicine Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Colchicine is an alkaloid chemically described as (S)N- (5,6,7,9-tetrahydro- 1,2,3, 10-tetramethoxy-9-oxobenzo [alpha] heptalen-7-yl) acetamide with a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">25</span>NO<span class="Sub">6</span> and a molecular weight of 399.4. The structural formula of colchicine is given below.</p><p>Colchicine, USP is white to pale yellow powder.

Additionally, colchicine disrupts cytoskeletal functions through inhibition of β-tubulin polymerization into microtubules and consequently prevents the activation, degranulation and migration of neutrophils thought to mediate some gout symptoms.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>In healthy adults, colchicine is absorbed when given orally, reaching a mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 2.5 ng/mL (range 1.1 ng/mL to 4.4 ng/mL) in one to two hours (range 0.5 to 3 hours) after a single dose administered under fasting conditions.</p><p>Following oral administration of colchicine given as 1.8 mg colchicine over one hour to healthy, young adults under fasting conditions, colchicine appears to be readily absorbed, reaching mean maximum plasma concentrations of 6.2 ng/mL at a median 1.81 hours (range: 1 to 2.5 hours). Following administration of the nonrecommended high-dose regimen (4.8 mg over six hours), mean maximal plasma concentrations were 6.8 ng/mL, at a median 4.47 hours (range: 3.1 to 7.5 hours).</p><p>After ten days on a regimen of 0.6 mg twice daily, peak concentrations are 3.1 ng/mL to 3.6 ng/mL (range 1.6 ng/mL to 6 ng/mL), occurring 1.3 to 1.4 hours postdose (range 0.5 to 3 hours).

No evidence of colchicine-related tumorigenicity was observed in mice or rats at colchicine oral doses up to 3 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately six and eight times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose of 2.4 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span></span></p><p>Colchicine was negative for mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. In a chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human white blood cells, colchicine treatment resulted in the formation of micronuclei. Since published studies demonstrated that colchicine induces aneuploidy from the process of mitotic nondisjunction without structural DNA changes, colchicine is not considered clastogenic, although micronuclei are formed.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility</span></span></p><p>No studies of colchicine effects on fertility were conducted with Colchicine Tablets. However, published nonclinical studies demonstrated that colchicine-induced disruption of microtubule formation affects meiosis and mitosis. Reproductive studies also reported abnormal sperm morphology and reduced sperm counts in males, and interference with sperm penetration, second meiotic division and normal cleavage in females when exposed to colchicine. Colchicine administered to pregnant animals resulted in fetal death and teratogenicity. These effects were dose-dependent, with the timing of exposure critical for the effects on embryofetal development. The nonclinical doses evaluated were generally higher than an equivalent human therapeutic dose, but safety margins for reproductive and developmental toxicity could not be determined.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with chronic gout is derived from the published literature. Two randomized clinical trials assessed the efficacy of colchicine 0.6 mg twice a day for the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with gout initiating treatment with urate-lowering therapy. In both trials, treatment with colchicine decreased the frequency of gout flares.</p><p>The efficacy of a low-dosage regimen of oral colchicine (colchicine total dose 1.8 mg over one hour) for treatment of gout flares was assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, one week, dose-comparison study. Patients meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for gout were randomly assigned to three groups: high-dose colchicine (1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg hourly × 6 hours [4.8 mg total]); low-dose colchicine (1.2 mg, then 0.6 mg in one hour [1.8 mg total] followed by five placebo doses hourly); or placebo (two capsules, then one capsule hourly × six hours). Patients took the first dose within 12 hours of the onset of the flare and recorded pain intensity (11-point Likert scale) and adverse events over 72 hours. The efficacy of colchicine was measured based on response to treatment in the target joint, using patient self-assessment of pain at 24 hours following the time of first dose as recorded in the diary. A responder was one who achieved at least a 50% reduction in pain score at the 24-hour postdose assessment relative to the pretreatment score and did not use rescue medication prior to the actual time of 24-hour postdose assessment.</p><p>Rates of response were similar for the recommended low-dose treatment group (38%) and the nonrecommended high-dose group (33%) but were higher as compared to the placebo group (16%) as shown in Table 8.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients achieving varying degrees of improvement in pain from baseline at 24 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pain Relief on Low and High Doses of Colchicine and Placebo (Cumulative)</span></p><p>The evidence for the efficacy of colchicine in patients with FMF is derived from the published literature. Three randomized, placebo-controlled studies were identified. The three placebo-controlled studies randomized a total of 48 adult patients diagnosed with FMF and reported similar efficacy endpoints as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>One of the studies randomized 15 patients with FMF to a six month crossover study during which five patients discontinued due to study noncompliance. The ten patients completing the study experienced five attacks over the course of 90 days while treated with colchicine compared to 59 attacks over the course of 90 days while treated with placebo. Similarly, the second study randomized 22 patients with FMF to a four month crossover study during which nine patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy while receiving placebo or study noncompliance. The 13 patients completing the study experienced 18 attacks over the course of 60 days while treated with colchicine compared to 68 attacks over the course of 60 days while treated with placebo. The third study was discontinued after an interim analysis of six of the 11 patients enrolled had completed the study; results could not be confirmed.</p><p>Open-label experience with colchicine in adults and children with FMF is consistent with the randomized, controlled trial experience and was utilized to support information on the safety profile of colchicine and for dosing recommendations.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">Colchicine Tablets, USP 0.6 mg are purple, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets, debossed with '1351' on one side and scored on the other side and are supplied in bottles packaged in individual cartons as follows:</p><p>NDC 16714-039-01 in bottles of 30 tablets with child-resistant closure</p><p>NDC 16714-039-02 in bottles of 100 tablets with child-resistant closure</p><h3>Storage</h3><p class="First">Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p>Protect from light.</p><p>Store container in carton until all contents have been used.</p><p>DISPENSE IN TIGHT, LIGHT-RESISTANT CONTAINER.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosing Instructions</span></p><p>Patients should be advised to take colchicine as prescribed, even if they are feeling better.
