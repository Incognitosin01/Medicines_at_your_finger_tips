It works by killing the fungus or preventing its growth.</p><p>Oxiconazole is applied to the skin to treat:</p><ul>
<li>ringworm of the body (tinea corporis);</li>
<li>ringworm of the foot (tinea pedis; athlete's foot); and</li>
<li>ringworm of the groin (tinea cruris; jock itch).</li>

</ul><p>Oxiconazole is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Oxistat</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Oxiconazole cream has been tested in children and, in effective doses, has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults. However, ringworm rarely occurs in children below the age of 12.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of topical oxiconazole in the elderly with use in other age groups, this medicine is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Oxistat</h2><p>Apply enough oxiconazole to cover the affected and surrounding skin areas and rub in gently.</p><p>Keep this medicine away from the eyes, nose, mouth, and other mucous membranes. Also, do not use it in the vagina. Wash hands after application to affected areas.</p><p>To help clear up your infection completely, it is very important that you keep using oxiconazole for the full time of treatment , even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days. Since fungus infections may be very slow to clear up, you may have to continue using this medicine every day for several weeks or more. If you stop using this medicine too soon, your symptoms may return. Do not miss any doses .</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
