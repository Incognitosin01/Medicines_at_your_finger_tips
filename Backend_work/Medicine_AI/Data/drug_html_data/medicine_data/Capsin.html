Capsaicin is used in medicated creams and lotions to relieve muscle or joint pain.</p><p>Capsaicin used on the body causes a sensation of heat that activates certain nerve cells. With regular use of capsaicin, this heating effect reduces the amount of substance P, a chemical that acts as a pain messenger in the body.</p><p>Capsin is used for temporary relief of muscle or joint pain caused by strains, sprains, arthritis, bruising, or backaches. This medicine is also used to treat nerve pain (neuralgia) in people who have had herpes zoster, or "shingles."</p><p>Qutenza is a prescription-strength form of capsaicin topical that is applied by a healthcare professional. Qutenza is used to treat nerve pain caused by herpes, and also to treat nerve pain in the feet (peripheral neuropathy) in people with diabetes.</p><p>Capsin may also be used for purposes not listed in  Capsin guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use this medicine if you are allergic to chili peppers, or if you have ever had an allergic reaction to Capsin.</p><p>Capsaicin can cause a burning sensation wherever it is applied. If you have severe discomfort or skin redness, wash the treated skin area with soap and cool water.</p><p><b>Get medical attention right away if you have severe burning, pain, swelling, or blistering of the skin where you applied this medicine.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Do not use  Capsin if you are allergic to chili peppers, or if you have ever had an allergic reaction to Capsin.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>any allergies (especially to plants); or</p>

The Qutenza brand of capsaicin is applied only by a healthcare professional and is not available over the counter.</p><p>Do not take by mouth. Topical medicine is for use only on the skin.</p><p>Capsaicin is available in different forms, such as a cream, lotion, liquid, and skin patch. Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Do not use this medicine on open wounds or on sunburned, windburned, dry, chapped, or irritated skin. <b>If this medicine gets in your eyes, nose, mouth, rectum, or vagina, rinse with water.</b></p><p>Make sure your skin is clean and dry before you apply Capsin.</p><p>Wash your hands with soap and water immediately after applying Capsin or handling a topical skin patch. If you have applied the medicine to your hands or fingers to treat pain in those areas, wait at least 30 minutes before washing your hands.</p><p>To prevent getting this medicine on your fingers, use a rubber glove, finger cot, cotton ball, or clean tissue to apply the medicine.</p><p>Capsaicin can cause a burning sensation wherever it is applied. Even if the medicine gets on a surface other than your skin, you may feel burning when you later touch that surface. This sensation is usually mild and should gradually lessen over time with continued regular use of the medicine.</p><p>If the burning sensation is painful or causes severe discomfort, wash the treated skin area with soap and cool water. <b>Get medical attention right away if you have severe burning, pain, swelling, or blistering.</b></p><p>Do not cover treated skin with a bandage or heating pad, which can increase the burning sensation. You may cover the skin with clothing.</p><p>Avoid taking a bath or shower within 1 hour before or after you apply capsaicin to your skin. Also avoid swimming or vigorous exercise. Warm water or perspiration can increase the burning sensation caused by capsaicin.</p><p>Avoid getting Capsin in your eyes or near your nose where you might inhale it. If it does get into any of these areas, rinse thoroughly with water.</p><p>Also avoid getting this medicine on contact lenses, dentures, and other items that come into contact with sensitive areas of your body.</p><p>It may take up to 2 weeks of using this medicine regularly before your symptoms improve. For best results, keep using the medicine as directed. Pain relief should occur gradually as the substance P in your body is decreased in the nerve cells.</p><p>Call your doctor if your pain does not improve after using this medicine for 7 days, or if your symptoms get worse or get better and then come back in a few days.</p><p>Store Capsin at room temperature away from moisture and heat, in a place where children and pets cannot get to it.</p><p>Capsin liquid is flammable. Do not use or store near fire or open flame.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not apply capsaicin more than 4 times in one day, or use extra medicine to make up a missed dose.</p><p>A missed dose of  Capsin will not cause harm but may make the medicine less effective reducing substance P and relieving your pain.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222, especially if anyone has accidentally swallowed it.</p><p>Accidental swallowing of capsaicin can cause severe burning in or around the mouth, watery eyes, runny nose, and trouble swallowing or breathing.</p><p>Applying too much Capsin to the skin can cause severe burning or redness.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  Capsin?</h2><p>Avoid inhaling the odor or dried residue of capsaicin topical.
