</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Tri Femynor</h2><h3>1.1 Oral Contraceptive</h3><p class="First">Tri Femynor Tablets are indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14)</span>].</p><h3>1.2 Acne</h3><p class="First">Tri Femynor is indicated for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris in females at least 15 years of age, who have no known contraindications to oral contraceptive therapy and have achieved menarche.

</ul><ul class="Square">
<li>Women over age 35 with any migraine headaches [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>]</li>
</ul><ul class="Disk">
<li>Liver tumors, benign or malignant, or liver disease [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]</li>
<li>Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</span>]</li>
<li>Pregnancy, because there is no reason to use COCs during pregnancy [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>]</li>
<li>Breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancer, now or in the past [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)</span>]</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><ul class="Disk">
<li>Stop Tri Femynor if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs.</li>
<li>Stop Tri Femynor if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</li>
<li>If feasible, stop Tri Femynor at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization.</li>
<li>Start Tri Femynor no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</li>
<li>The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</li>
<li>Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke.</li>
<li>Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</li>
</ul><h3>5.2 Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impaired Liver Function</span></p><p>Do not use Tri Femynor in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri Femynor if jaundice develops.</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver Tumors</span></p><p>Tri Femynor is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>5.3 High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Tri Femynor is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri Femynor if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.</p><h3>5.4 Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.</p><h3>5.5 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri Femynor. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>5.6 Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Tri Femynor develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri Femynor if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of Tri Femynor in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).</p><h3>5.7 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></p><p>Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.</p><p>In clinical trials of Femynor, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles). A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued Femynor, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14 to 34% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.</p><p><span class="Bold">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></p><p>Women who use Femynor may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><p>If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more red “active” tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><h3>5.8 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Tri Femynor use if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>5.9 Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Tri Femynor if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>5.10 Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix</h3><ul class="Disk">
<li>Tri Femynor is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</li>
</ul><p class="First">              There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have                              suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</li>
</ul><h3>5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>5.12 Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.</p><h3>5.13 Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>5.14 Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri Femynor.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [<span class="Italics">see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>
<li>Vascular events [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>
<li>Liver disease [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]</li>
</ul><p>Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Irregular uterine bleeding</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Breast tenderness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
</ul><h3>6.1 Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety of Tri Femynor was evaluated in 4,826 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 6 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of Tri Femynor for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 4 were uncontrolled open-label trials.  In 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles; in 2 trials, subjects were followed for up to 12 cycles; and in 1 trial, subjects were followed for up to 6 cycles.</p><p><span class="Bold">Common Adverse Reactions (≥ 2% of subjects)</span>: The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of the 4,826 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (33.6%), breast issues (including breast pain, enlargement, and discharge) (8.0%), vaginal infection (7.1%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (5.6%), mood disorders (including mood alteration and depression) (3.8%), genital discharge (3.2%), and changes in weight (including weight fluctuation, increased or decreased) (2.5%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation</span>: Over the three trials, between 9 to 27% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (4.3%), nausea/vomiting (2.8%), headache/migraine (2.4%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (1.1%), and weight increased (1.1%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious Adverse Reactions</span>: breast cancer (1 subject), carcinoma of the cervix <span class="Italics">in situ</span> (1 subject), hypertension (1 subject), and migraine (2 subjects).</p><h3>6.2 Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations</span>: Urinary tract infection;</p><p><span class="Italics">Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl.

Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p><p><span class="Bold">Colesevelam</span>: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart.</p><p><span class="Bold">Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs</span>:</p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:</span></p><p>Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]).</p><h3>7.2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</h3><ul class="Disk">
<li>COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations.</li>
<li>COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</li>
</ul><p class="First">Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs.</p><h3>7.3 Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy. Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><h3>8.3 Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception, when possible, until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Tri Femynor has been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-pubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.</p><p>There was no significant difference between Tri Femynor and placebo in mean change to total lumbar spine (L1-L4) and total hip bone mineral density between baseline and Cycle 13 in 123 adolescent females with anorexia nervosa in a double blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, one-year treatment duration clinical trial for the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population.</p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Tri Femynor has not been studied in postmenopausal women and are not indicated in this population.</p><h3>8.6 Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Tri Femynor has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.

<li><span class="Bold">Oral Contraception</span></li>
</ul><p class="First">COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p><ul class="Disk">
<li><span class="Bold">Acne</span></li>
</ul><p>Acne is a skin condition with a multifactorial etiology, including androgen stimulation of sebum production. While the combination of ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate increases sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and decreases free testosterone, the relationship between these changes and a decrease in the severity of facial acne in otherwise healthy women with this skin condition has not been established.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Tri Femynor.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Norgestimate (NGM) and EE are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass (intestinal and/or hepatic) mechanisms to norelgestromin (NGMN) and norgestrel (NG), which are the major active metabolites of norgestimate.</p><p>Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE are generally reached by 2 hours after administration of Tri Femynor. Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 250 mcg NGM / 35 mcg EE dose is approximately 2-fold for NGMN and EE compared with single dose administration. The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose-proportional following NGM doses of 180 mcg to 250 mcg. Steady-state concentration of EE is achieved by Day 7 of each dosing cycle. Steady-state concentrations of NGMN and NG are achieved by Day 21. Non-linear accumulation (approximately 8 fold) of NG is observed as a result of high-affinity binding to SHBG, which limits its biological activity (Table 3).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Summary of NGMN, NG and EE pharmacokinetic parameters.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of</span> <span class="Bold">Tri Femynor</span><span class="Bold">During a Three Cycle Study</span></p><p class="First">Analyte</p><p class="First">Cycle</p><p class="First">Day</p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span></p><p class="First">t<span class="Sub">max</span> (h)</p><p class="First">AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span></p><p class="First">t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> (h)</p><p class="First">NGMN</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">1.80 (0.46)</p><p class="First">1.42 (0.73)</p><p class="First">15.0 (3.88)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">2.12 (0.56)</p><p class="First">1.21 (0.26)</p><p class="First">16.1 (4.97)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">2.66 (0.47)</p><p class="First">1.29 (0.26)</p><p class="First">21.4 (3.46)</p><p class="First">22.3 (6.54)</p><p class="First">NG</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">1.94 (0.82)</p><p class="First">3.15 (4.05)</p><p class="First">34.8 (16.5)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">3.00 (1.04)</p><p class="First">2.21 (2.03)</p><p class="First">55.2 (23.5)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">3.66 (1.15)</p><p class="First">2.58 (2.97)</p><p class="First">69.3 (23.8)</p><p class="First">40.2 (15.4)</p><p class="First">EE</p><p class="First">3</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">124 (39.5)</p><p class="First">1.27 (0.26)</p><p class="First">1130 (420)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">14</p><p class="First">128 (38.4)</p><p class="First">1.32 (0.25)</p><p class="First">1130 (324)</p><p class="First">NC</p><p class="First">21</p><p class="First">126 (34.7)</p><p class="First">1.31 (0.56)</p><p class="First">1090 (359)</p><p class="First">15.9 (4.39)</p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span> = peak serum concentration, t<span class="Sub">max</span> = time to reach peak serum concentration, AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> = area under serum concentration vs time curve from 0 to 24 hours, t<span class="Sub">1/2</span> = elimination half-life, NC = not calculated.</p><p class="First">NGMN and NG: C<span class="Sub">max</span> = ng/mL, AUC<span class="Sub">0–24h</span> = h·ng/mL</p><p class="First">EE: C<span class="Sub">max</span> = pg/mL, AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> = h·pg/mL</p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></p><p>The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of Tri Femynor has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>NGMN and NG are highly bound (&gt;97%) to serum proteins.

<li>Take <span class="Bold">1</span> pill every day at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on your blister pack.</li>
<li>Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late) <span class="Bold">you could get pregnant</span>. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.</li>
<li>If you have trouble remembering to takeTri Femynor, talk to your healthcare provider. When you first start takingTri Femynor, spotting or light bleeding in between your periods may occur. Contact your healthcare provider if this does not go away after a few months.</li>
<li>You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseous), especially during the first few months of takingTri Femynor. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If your nausea does not go away, call your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills (see <span class="Bold">What should I do if I miss any</span> <span class="Bold">Tri Femynor pills</span><span class="Bold">?</span> below), you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.</li>
<li>It is not uncommon to miss a period.

If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop takingTri Femynor.</li>
<li>If you have vomiting or diarrhea within <span class="Bold">3 to 4</span> hours of taking your pill, take another pill of the same color from your extra blister pack.
