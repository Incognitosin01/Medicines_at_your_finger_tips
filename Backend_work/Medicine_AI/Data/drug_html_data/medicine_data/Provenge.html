This type of treatment is called autologous immunotherapy.</p><p>Provenge is usually given after surgery or other medications have been tried without success.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you are treated with Provenge, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, especially heart disease, asthma, COPD or other breathing problems, or if you have ever had a stroke.</p><p>Provenge is used in a treatment called autologous immunotherapy. Sipuleucel-T is mixed with certain immune cells drawn from your own blood, and this mixture is injected into your body.</p><p>Your doctor will determine your schedule for cell collection and Provenge injection. Follow your doctor's instructions very carefully. The timing of cell collection in relation to Provenge infusion is extremely important. If you miss an infusion appointment your prepared infusion cannot be used in the future. Some people receiving this injection have had a reaction to the infusion (when the medicine is injected into the vein). Tell your caregiver right away if you feel dizzy, tired, or nauseated, or if you have fever, chills, joint pain, severe headache, blurred vision, buzzing in your ears, anxiety, confusion, vomiting, chest pain, fast or uneven heartbeats, wheezing, chest tightness, or trouble breathing. These side effects may occur during the Provenge injection or within the first 24 hours after your infusion.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>To make sure Provenge is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

</ul><p>heart problems;</p><p>a stroke; or</p><p>breathing problems.</p><h2>How is Provenge given?</h2><p>Provenge is given after a procedure called leukapheresis (LOO-kuh-fuh-REE-sis).</p><p>During leukapheresis, some of your blood is collected through a small tube (catheter) placed into a vein. The catheter is connected to a machine that separates your white blood cells from other parts of the blood.</p><p>The collected blood cells are then mixed with Provenge and injected back into your body about 3 days after leukapheresis.</p><p>When injected into your body, these treated blood cells help strengthen your immune system to target and attack certain prostate cancer cells.</p><p>A healthcare provider will give you this infusion, which takes about 60 minutes to complete. You will be watched closely for at least 30 minutes to make sure you do not have an infusion reaction.</p><p>You may be given other medications to help prevent serious side effects or an allergic reaction. Keep using these medicines for as long as your doctor has prescribed.</p><p>This treatment is usually given 3 times about 2 weeks apart.</p><p>Your doctor will determine your schedule for cell collection and Provenge injection.
