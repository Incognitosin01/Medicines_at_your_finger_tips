</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Bold">Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term trials. These trials did not show an increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant use in subjects over age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressant use in subjects aged 65 and older <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">In patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy, monitor closely for worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Bupropion Tablets</h2><p class="First">Bupropion hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).</p><p>The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in two 4-week controlled inpatient trials and one 6-week controlled outpatient trial of adult subjects with MDD <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> .</p><h2>Bupropion Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Instructions for Use</h3><p class="First">To minimize the risk of seizure, increase the dose gradually <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> . Increases in dose should not exceed 100 mg/ day in a 3-day period. Bupropion hydrochloride Tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without food.</p><p>The recommended starting dose is 200 mg/day, given as 100 mg twice daily. After 3 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to 300 mg /day, given as 100 mg 3 times daily, with at least 6 hours between successive doses. Dosing above 300 mg/ day may be accomplished using the 75 mg or 100 mg tablets.</p><p>A maximum of 450 mg /day, given in divided doses of not more than 150 mg each, may be considered for patients who show no clinical improvement after several weeks of treatment at 300 mg /day. Administer the 100 mg tablet 4 times daily to not exceed the limit of 150 mg in a single dose.</p><p>It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of antidepressant drug treatment beyond the response in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.</p><h3>Dose Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7 to 15), the maximum dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablet is 75 mg /day. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5 to 6), consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of dosing <span class="Italics">[see Use in SpecificPopulations(8.7), ClinicalPharmacology(12.3)].</span></p><h3>Dose Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of bupropion hydrochloridetablets in patients with renal impairment (Glomerular Filtration Rate less than 90 mL/min) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Switching a Patient to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Antidepressant</h3><p class="First">At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of therapy with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping bupropion hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.6)]</span> .</p><h3>Use of Bupropion Hydrochloride with Reversible MAOIs Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue</h3><p class="First">Do not start bupropion hydrochloride tablets in a patient who is being treated with a reversible MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. Drug interactions can increase the risk of hypertensive reactions. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, non-pharmacological interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.6)]</span> .</p><p>In some cases, a patient already receiving therapy with bupropion hydrochloride tablets may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of hypertensive reactions in a particular patient, bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with bupropion hydrochloride tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.</p><p>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with bupropion hydrochloride tablet is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of a drug interaction with such use <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.6)]</span> .</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul>

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul>
<li>Bupropion hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder.</li>
<li>Bupropion hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with a current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or anorexia nervosa as a higher incidence of seizures was observed in such patients treated with bupropion hydrochloride tablets <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> .</li>
<li>Bupropion hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span> .</li>
<li>The use of MAOIs (intended to treat psychiatric disorders) concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride tablets or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated. There is an increased risk of hypertensive reactions when bupropion hydrochloride tablets are used concomitantly with MAOIs. The use of bupropion hydrochloride tablets within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI is also contraindicated. Starting bupropion hydrochloride tablets in a patient treated with reversible MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7.6)].</span></li>
<li>Bupropion hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to bupropion or other ingredients of bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults</h3><p class="First">Patients with MDD, both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.</p><p>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) show that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to</p><p>24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term clinical trials did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p><p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 subjects. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 subjects. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger subjects for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 subjects treated) are provided in Table 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1. Risk Differences in the Number of Suicidality Cases by Age Group in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Subjects</span></p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span> .</span></p><p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p><p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</span></p><h3>Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Suicide Risk in Smoking Cessation Treatment</h3><p class="First">Bupropion hydrochloridetablet is not approved for smoking cessation treatment; however, it contains the same active ingredient as the smoking cessation medication ZYBAN. Serious neuropsychiatric adverse events have been reported in patients taking bupropion for smoking cessation. These postmarketing reports have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span> . Some patients who stopped smoking may have been experiencing symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, including depressed mood. Depression, rarely including suicidal ideation, has been reported in smokers undergoing a smoking cessation attempt without medication. However, some of these adverse events occurred in patients taking bupropion who continued to smoke.</p><p>Neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred in patients without and with pre-existing psychiatric disease; some patients experienced worsening of their psychiatric illnesses. Observe patients for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should stop taking bupropion hydrochloride tablets and contact a healthcare provider immediately if agitation, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient are observed, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. In many postmarketing cases, resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of bupropion was reported. However, the symptoms persisted in some cases; therefore, ongoing monitoring and supportive care should be provided until symptoms resolve. <span class="Bold"> </span></p><h3>Seizure</h3><p class="First">Bupropion hydrochloride tablets can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 450 mg/day. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue bupropion hydrochloride tablets and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.</p><p>The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Bupropion hydrochloride tablet is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, current or prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)]</span> . The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: severe head injury; arteriovenous malformation; CNS tumor or CNS infection; severe stroke; concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids); metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia); use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine); or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin; use of anorectic drugs; and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.</p><p><span class="Bold">Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Use:</span> Bupropion is associated with seizures in approximately 0.4% (4/1,000) of patients treated at doses up to 450 mg/day. The estimated seizure incidence for bupropion hydrochloride tablets increases almost 10-fold between 450 and 600 mg/ day.</p><p> </p><p>The risk of seizure can be reduced if the dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets does not exceed 450 mg/day, given as 150 mg 3 times daily, and the titration rate is gradual.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">Treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets can result in elevated blood pressure and hypertension. Assess blood pressure before initiating treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets, and monitor periodically during treatment. The risk of hypertension is increased if bupropion hydrochloride tablet is used concomitantly with MAOIs or other drugs that increase dopaminergic or noradrenergic activity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>Data from a comparative trial of the sustained-release formulation of bupropion HCl, nicotine transdermal system (NTS), the combination of sustained-release bupropion plus NTS, and placebo as an aid to smoking cessation suggest a higher incidence of treatment-emergent hypertension in patients treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS. In this trial, 6.1% of subjects treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS had treatment-emergent hypertension compared with 2.5%, 1.6%, and 3.1% of subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion, NTS, and placebo, respectively. The majority of these subjects had evidence of pre-existing hypertension. Three subjects (1.2%) treated with the combination of sustained-release bupropion and NTS and 1 subject (0.4%) treated with NTS had study medication discontinued due to hypertension compared with none of the subjects treated with sustained-release bupropion or placebo. Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended in patients who receive the combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement.</p><p>Ina clinical trial of bupropion immediate-release in MDD subjects with stable congestive heart failure (N = 36), bupropion was associated with an exacerbation of pre-existing hypertension in 2 subjects, leading to discontinuation of bupropion treatment. There are no controlled trials assessing the safety of bupropion in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable cardiac disease.</p><h3>Activation of Mania/Hypomania</h3><p class="First">Antidepressant treatment can precipitate a manic, mixed, or hypomanic manic episode. The risk appears to be increased in patients with bipolar disorder or who have risk factors for bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating bupropion hydrochloride tablets, screen patients for a history of bipolar disorder and the presence of risk factors for bipolar disorder (e.g., family history of bipolar disorder, suicide, or depression). Bupropion hydrochloride tablet is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.</p><h3>Psychosis and Other Neuropsychiatric Reactions</h3><p class="First">Depressed patients treated with bupropion hydrochloride tablets have had a variety of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, concentration disturbance, paranoia, and confusion. Some of these patients had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. In some cases, these symptoms abated upon dose reduction and/or withdrawal of treatment. Instruct patients to contact a healthcare professional if such reactions occur.</p><h3>Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including bupropion hydrochloride tablets may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions have occurred during clinical trials with bupropion. Reactions have been characterized by pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and dyspnea requiring medical treatment. In addition, there have been rare, spontaneous postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and anaphylactic shock associated with bupropion. Instruct patients to discontinue bupropion hydrochloride tablets and consult a healthcare provider if they develop an allergic or anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction (e.g., skin rash, pruritus, hives, chest pain, edema, and shortness of breath) during treatment.</p><p>There are reports of arthralgia, myalgia, fever with rash and other serum sickness-like symptoms suggestive of delayed hypersensitivity.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment</span></p><p>Adverse reactions were sufficiently troublesome to cause discontinuation of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets in approximately 10% of the 2,400 subjects and healthy volunteers who participated in clinical trials during the product’s initial development. The more common events causing discontinuation include neuropsychiatric disturbances (3.0%), primarily agitation and abnormalities in mental status; gastrointestinal disturbances (2.1%), primarily nausea and vomiting; neurological disturbances (1.7%), primarily seizures, headaches, and sleep disturbances; and dermatologic problems (1.4%), primarily rashes. It is important to note, however, that many of these events occurred at doses that exceed the recommended daily dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Adverse reactions commonly encountered in subjects treated with bupropion hydrochloride tablets are agitation, dry mouth, insomnia, headache/migraine, nausea/vomiting, constipation, tremor, dizziness, excessive sweating, blurred vision, tachycardia, confusion, rash, hostility, cardiac arrhythmia, and auditory disturbance.</p><p>Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled trials at an incidence of at least 1% of subjects receiving bupropion hydrochloride tablets and more frequently in these subjects than in the placebo group.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported by at Least 1% of Subjects and at a Greater Frequency than Placebo in Controlled Clinical Trials</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Other Adverse Reactions Observed during the Clinical Development of Bupropion Hydrochloride Tablets</span></p><p>The conditions and duration of exposure to bupropion hydrochloride tablets varied greatly, and a substantial proportion of the experience was gained in open and uncontrolled clinical settings. During this experience, numerous adverse events were reported; however, without appropriate controls, it is impossible to determine with certainty which events were or were not caused by bupropion hydrochloride tablets. The following enumeration is organized by organ system and describes events in terms of their relative frequency of reporting in the database.</p><p>The following definitions of frequency are used: Frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 subjects. Infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 subjects, while rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Frequent was edema; infrequent were chest pain, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (premature beats and nonspecific ST-T changes), and shortness of breath/dyspnea; rare were flushing, and myocardial infarction.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dermatologic:</span> Infrequent was alopecia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine:</span> Infrequent was gynecomastia; rare was glycosuria.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal</span>: Infrequent were dysphagia, thirst disturbance, and liver damage/jaundice; rare was intestinal perforation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Genitourinary:</span> Frequent was nocturia; infrequent were vaginal irritation, testicular swelling, urinary tract infection, painful erection, and retarded ejaculation; rare were enuresis, and urinary incontinence.</p><p><span class="Italics">Neurological:</span> Frequent were ataxia/incoordination, seizure, myoclonus, dyskinesia, and dystonia; infrequent were mydriasis, vertigo, and dysarthria; rare were electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormality, and impaired attention.</p><p><span class="Italics">Neuropsychiatric:</span> Frequent were mania/hypomania, increased libido, hallucinations, decrease in sexual function, and depression; infrequent were memory impairment, depersonalization, psychosis, dysphoria, mood instability, paranoia, and formal thought disorder; rare was suicidal ideation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Oral Complaints:</span> Frequent was stomatitis; infrequent were toothache, bruxism, gum irritation, and oral edema.</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> Infrequent were bronchitis and shortness of breath/dyspnea; rare was pulmonary embolism.</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses:</span> Infrequent was visual disturbance; rare was diplopia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nonspecific:</span> Frequent were flu-like symptoms; infrequent was nonspecific pain; rare was overdose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Altered Appetite and Weight</span></p><p>A weight loss of greater than 5 lbs. occurred in 28% of subjects receiving bupropion hydrochloride tablets. This incidence is approximately double that seen in comparable subjects treated with tricyclics or placebo. Furthermore, while 35% of subjects receiving tricyclic antidepressants gained weight, only 9.4% of subjects treated with bupropion hydrochloride tablets did. Consequently, if weight loss is a major presenting sign of a patient’s depressive illness, the anorectic and/or weight-reducing potential of bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be considered.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bupropion hydrochloride tablets and are not described elsewhere in the label. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Body (General)</span><br/>

Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between bupropion hydrochloride tablets and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6.</p><p><span class="Bold">Inhibitors of CYP2B6</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel:</span> Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure. Based on clinical response, dosage adjustment of bupropion hydrochloride tablets may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Bold">Inducers of CYP2B6</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Ritonavir, Lopinavir, and Efavirenz:</span> Concomitant treatment with these drugs can decrease bupropion and hydroxybupropion exposure. Dosage increase of bupropion hydrochloride tablets may be necessary when coadministered with ritonavir, lopinavir, or efavirenz <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin:</span> While not systematically studied, these drugs may induce the metabolism of bupropion and may decrease bupropion exposure <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . If bupropion is used concomitantly with a CYP inducer, it may be necessary to increase the dose of bupropion, but the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded.</p><h3>Potential for Bupropion Hydrochloride to Affect Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6</span></p><p>Bupropion and its metabolites (erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, hydroxybupropion) are CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, coadministration of bupropion hydrochloride tablets with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase the exposures of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Such drugs include certain antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide). When used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride tablets, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these CYP2D6 substrates, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.</p><p>Drugs that require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 to be effective (e.g., tamoxifen) theoretically could have reduced efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as bupropion.

Monitor plasma digoxin levels in patients treated concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride tablets and digoxin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold</h3><p class="First">Use extreme caution when coadministering bupropion hydrochloride tablets with other drugs that lower seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, or systemic corticosteroids). Use low initial doses and increase the dose gradually <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Dopaminergic Drugs (Levodopa and Amantadine)</h3><p class="First">Bupropion, levodopa, and amantadine have dopamine agonist effects. CNS toxicity has been reported when bupropion was coadministered with levodopa or amantadine. Adverse reactions have included restlessness, agitation, tremor, ataxia, gait disturbance, vertigo, and dizziness. It is presumed that the toxicity results from cumulative dopamine agonist effects. Use caution when administering bupropion hydrochloride tablets concomitantly with these drugs.</p><h3>Use with Alcohol</h3><p class="First">In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. The consumption of alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be minimized or avoided.</p><h3>MAO Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Concomitant use of MAOIs and bupropion is contraindicated because there is an increased risk of hypertensive reactions if bupropion is used concomitantly with MAOIs. Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping bupropion hydrochloride tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5) , Contraindications (4)]</span> .</p><h3>Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines have been reported in patients taking bupropion. This is due to lack of specificity of some screening tests. False-positive test results may result even following discontinuation of bupropion therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish bupropion from amphetamines.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Data from epidemiological studies of pregnant women exposed to bupropion in the first trimester have not identified an increased risk of congenital malformations overall <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> There are risks to the mother associated with untreated depression in pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</span> When bupropion was administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis, there was no evidence of fetal malformations at doses up to approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 450 mg/day.

The prospectively observed rate of cardiovascular malformations in pregnancies with exposure to bupropion in the first trimester from the international Pregnancy Registry was 1.3% (9 cardiovascular malformations/675 first trimester maternal bupropion exposures), which is similar to the background rate of cardiovascular malformations (approximately 1%). Data from the United Healthcare database, which had a limited number of exposed cases with cardiovascular malformations, and a case-control study (6,853 infants with cardiovascular malformations and 5,763 with non-cardiovascular malformations) of self-reported bupropion use from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) did not show an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall after bupropion exposure during the first trimester.</p><p>Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and risk for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association.

The Slone Epidemiology Study found an increased risk for VSD following first trimester maternal bupropion exposure (n = 17; adjusted OR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3, 5) but did not find increased risk for any other cardiovascular malformations studied (including LVOTO as above). The NBDPS and United Healthcare database study did not find an association between first trimester maternal bupropion exposure and VSD.</p><p>For the findings of LVOTO and VSD, the studies were limited by the small number of exposed cases, inconsistent findings among studies, and the potential for chance findings from multiple comparisons in case control studies.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> In studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits, bupropion was administered orally during the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 450 and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 10 and 6 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). There was no evidence of fetal malformations in rats.

There are no data on the effects of bupropion or its metabolites on milk production. Limited data from postmarketing reports have not identified a clear association of adverse reactions in the breastfed infant.

The average daily infant exposure (assuming 150 mL/kg daily consumption) to bupropion and its active metabolites was 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. Postmarketing reports have described seizures in breastfed infants. The relationship of bupropion exposure and these seizures is unclear.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the approximately 6,000 subjects who participated in clinical trials with bupropion sustained-release tablets (depression and smoking cessation trials), 275 were aged ≥65 years and 47 were aged ≥75 years. In addition, several hundred subjects aged ≥65 years participated in clinical trials using the immediate-release formulation of bupropion (depression trials). Nooverall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Bupropion is extensively metabolized in the liver to active metabolites, which are further metabolized and excreted by the kidneys. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be necessary to consider this factor in dose selection; it may be useful to monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Consider a reduced dose and/or dosing frequency of bupropion hydrochloride tablets in patients with renal impairment (Glomerular Filtration Rate: less than 90 mL/min). Bupropion and its metabolites are cleared renally and may accumulate in such patients to a greater extent than usual. Monitor closely for adverse reactions that could indicate high bupropion or metabolite exposures <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7 to 15), the maximum dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablet is 75 mg daily. In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5 to 6), consider reducing the dose and/or frequency of dosing <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2),</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Bupropion is not a controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Humans</span></p><p>Controlled clinical trials conducted in normal volunteers, in subjects with a history of multiple drug abuse, and in depressed subjects showed some increase in motor activity and agitation/excitement, often typical of central stimulant activity.</p><p>In a population of individuals experienced with drugs of abuse, a single oral dose of 400 mg of bupropion produced mild amphetamine-like activity as compared with placebo on the Morphine-Benzedrine Subscale of the Addiction Research Center Inventories (ARCI) and a score greater than placebo but less than 15 mg of the Schedule II stimulant dextroamphetamine on the Liking Scale of the ARCI. These scales measure general feelings of euphoria and drug liking which are often associated with abuse potential.</p><p>Findings in clinical trials, however, are not known to reliably predict the abuse potential of drugs. Nonetheless, evidence from single-dose trials does suggest that the recommended daily dosage of bupropion when administered orally in divided doses is not likely to be significantly reinforcing to amphetamine or CNS stimulant abusers. However, higher doses (which could not be tested because of the risk of seizure) might be modestly attractive to those who abuse CNS stimulant drugs.</p><p>Bupropion hydrochloride tablet is intended for oral use only. The inhalation of crushed tablets or injection of dissolved bupropion has been reported. Seizures and/or cases of death have been reported when bupropion has been administered intranasally or by parenteral injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Animals</span></p><p>Studies in rodents and primates demonstrated that bupropion exhibits some pharmacologic actions common to psychostimulants. In rodents, it has been shown to increase locomotor activity, elicit a mild stereotyped behavior response, and increase rates of responding in several schedule-controlled behavior paradigms. In primate models assessing the positive-reinforcing effects of psychoactive drugs, bupropion was self-administered intravenously. In rats, bupropion produced amphetamine-like and cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects in drug discrimination paradigms used to characterize the subjective effects of psychoactive drugs.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Human Overdose Experience</h3><p class="First">Overdoses of up to 30 grams or more of bupropion have been reported. Seizure was reported in approximately one-third of all cases. Other serious reactions reported with overdoses of bupropion alone included hallucinations, loss of consciousness, mental status changes, sinus tachycardia, ECG changes such as conduction disturbances (including QRS prolongation) or arrhythmias, clonus, myoclonus, and hyperreflexia. Fever, muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported mainly when bupropion was part of multiple drug overdoses.</p><p>Although most patients recovered without sequelae, deaths associated with overdoses of bupropion alone have been reported in patients ingesting large doses of the drug. Multiple uncontrolled seizures, bradycardia, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest prior to death were reported in these patients.</p><h3>Overdosage Management</h3><p class="First">Consult a Certified Poison Control Center for up-to-date guidance and advice. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers are listed in the Physician’s Desk Reference (PDR).

Its structure closely resembles that of diethylpropion; it is related to phenylethylamines. It is designated as (±)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-1­ propanone hydrochloride. The molecular weight is 276.2. The molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">13</span>H <span class="Sub">18</span>ClNO•HCl. Bupropion hydrochloride USP is white powder, soluble in water in 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, and in alcohol. It has a bitter taste and produces the sensation of local anesthesia on the oral mucosa. The structural formula is:</p><p> <br/>
</p><p>Bupropion hydrochloride tablets USP are supplied for oral administration as 75 mg (yellow) and 100 mg (red) film-coated tablets. Each tablet contains the labeled amount of bupropion hydrochloride and the inactive ingredients: 75 mg tablets contains cysteine hydrochloride, Low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, stearic acid, D&amp;C yellow No.10 aluminum lake, triacetin, titanium dioxide, FD&amp;C yellow No 6, hydroxypropyl cellulose.</p><p>100 mg tablets contains cysteine hydrochloride, Low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, stearic acid, triacetin, FD&amp;C Red No 40, FD&amp;C yellow No 6, titanium dioxide, hydroxypropyl cellulose.</p><h2>Bupropion Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The exact mechanism of the antidepressant action of bupropion is not known, but is presumed to be related to noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic mechanisms. Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and does not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. Bupropion does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Bupropion is a racemic mixture. The pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetics of the individual enantiomers have not been studied. The mean elimination half-life (±SD) of bupropion after chronic dosing is 21 (±9) hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations of bupropion are reached within 8 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The absolute bioavailability of bupropion hydrochloride tablets in humans has not been determined because an intravenous formulation for human use is not available. However, it appears likely that only a small proportion of any orally administered dose reaches the systemic circulation intact. In rat and dog studies, the bioavailability of bupropion ranged from 5% to 20%.</p><p>In humans, following oral administration of bupropion hydrochloride tablets, peak plasma bupropion concentrations are usually achieved within 2 hours. Plasma bupropion concentrations are dose-proportional following single doses of 100 to 250 mg; however, it is not known if the proportionality between dose and plasma level is maintained in chronic use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> tests show that bupropion is 84% bound to human plasma proteins at concentrations up to 200 mcg/mL. The extent of protein binding of the hydroxybupropion metabolite is similar to that for bupropion, whereas the extent of protein binding of the threohydrobupropion metabolite is about half that seen with bupropion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Bupropion is extensively metabolized in humans. Three metabolites are active: hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the <span class="Italics">tert</span>-butyl group of bupropion, and the amino-alcohol isomers threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the carbonyl group. In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while cytochrome P450 enzymes are not involved in the formation of threohydrobupropion. Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results in the formation of a glycine conjugate of meta-chlorobenzoic acid, which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is one-half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of the metabolites are as high as or higher than those of bupropion.</p><p>Following a single dose in humans, peak plasma concentrations of hydroxybupropion occur approximately 3 hours after administration of bupropion hydrochloride tablets and are approximately 10 times the peak level of the parent drug at steady state. The elimination half-life of hydroxybupropion is approximately 20 (±5) hours, and its AUC at steady state is about 17 times that of bupropion.</p><p>The times to peak concentrations for the erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites are similar to that of the hydroxybupropion metabolite. However, their elimination half-lives are longer, 33 (±10) and 37 (±13) hours, respectively, and steady-state AUCs are 1.5 and 7 times that of bupropion, respectively.</p><p>Bupropion and its metabolites exhibit linear kinetics following chronic administration of 300 to 450 mg/day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Following oral administration of 200 mg of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-bupropion in humans, 87% and 10% of the radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Only 0.5% of the oral dose was excreted as unchanged bupropion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Factors or conditions altering metabolic capacity (e.g., liver disease, congestive heart failure [CHF], age, concomitant medications, etc.) or elimination may be expected to influence the degree and extent of accumulation of the active metabolites of bupropion. The elimination of the major metabolites of bupropion may be affected by reduced renal or hepatic function because they are moderately polar compounds and are likely to undergo further metabolism or conjugation in the liver prior to urinary excretion.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment:</span> There is limited information on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion in patients with renal impairment. An inter-trial comparison between normal subjects and subjects with end- stage renal failure demonstrated that the parent drug C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were comparable in the 2 groups, whereas the hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites had a 2.3­ and 2.8-fold increase, respectively, in AUC for subjects with end-stage renal failure. A second trial, comparing normal subjects and subjects with moderate-to-severe renal impairment (GFR 30.9 ± 10.8 mL/min) showed that after a single 150-mg dose of sustained-release bupropion, exposure to bupropion was approximately 2-fold higher in subjects with impaired renal function, while levels of the hydroxybupropion and threo/erythrohydrobupropion (combined) metabolites were similar in the 2 groups. Bupropion is extensively metabolized in the liver to active metabolites, which are further metabolized and subsequently excreted by the kidneys. The elimination of the major metabolites of bupropion may be reduced by impaired renal function. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment and a reduced frequency and/or dose should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment:</span> The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion was characterized in 2 single-dose trials, one in subjects with alcoholic liver disease and one in subjects with mild-to-severe cirrhosis. The first trial demonstrated that the half-life of hydroxybupropion was significantly longer in 8 subjects with alcoholic liver disease than in</p><p>8 healthy volunteers (32 ± 14 hours versus 21 ± 5 hours, respectively). Although not statistically significant, the AUCs for bupropion and hydroxybupropion were more variable and tended to be</p><p>greater (by 53% to 57%) in volunteers with alcoholic liver disease. The differences in half-life for bupropion and the other metabolites in the 2 groups were minimal.</p><p>The second trial demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites in 9 subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis compared with 8 healthy volunteers. However, more variability was observed in some of the pharmacokinetic parameters for bupropion (AUC, C <span class="Sub">max</span>, and T <span class="Sub">max</span>) and its active metabolites (t½) in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis. In subjects with severe hepatic cirrhosis, significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites were seen (Table 3).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3.

A single-dose pharmacokinetic trial demonstrated that the disposition of bupropion and its metabolites in elderly subjects was similar to that of younger subjects. These data suggest there is no prominent effect of age on bupropion concentration; however, another single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics trial suggested that the elderly are at increased risk for accumulation of bupropion and its metabolites <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients: P</span>ooled analysis of bupropion pharmacokinetic data from 90 healthy male and 90 healthy female volunteers revealed no sex-related differences in the peak plasma concentrations of bupropion. The mean systemic exposure (AUC) was approximately 13% higher in male volunteers compared with female volunteers. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.</p><p><span class="Italics">Smokers:</span> The effects of cigarette smoking on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion were studied in 34 healthy male and female volunteers; 17 were chronic cigarette smokers and 17 were nonsmokers. Following oral administration of a single 150-mg dose of bupropion, there were no statistically significant differences in C <span class="Sub">max</span>, half-life, T <span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, or clearance of bupropion or its active metabolites between smokers and nonsmokers.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Potential for Other Drugs to Affect bupropion hydrochloride tablets:</span> In vitro studies indicate that bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6. Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between bupropion hydrochloride tablets and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6. In addition, in vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.</p><p><span class="Italics">Inhibitors of CYP2B6:</span> Ticlopidine, Clopidogrel: In a trial in healthy male volunteers, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily or ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily increased exposures (Cmax and AUC) of bupropion by 40% and 60% for clopidogrel, and by 38% and 85% for ticlopidine, respectively. The exposures (Cmax and AUC) of hydroxybupropion were decreased 50% and 52%, respectively, by clopidogrel, and 78% and 84%, respectively, by ticlopidine. This effect is thought to be due to the inhibition of the CYP2B6-catalyzed bupropion hydroxylation.</p><p><span class="Italics">Prasugrel:</span> Prasugrel is a weak inhibitor of CYP2B6. In healthy subjects, prasugrel increased bupropion C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values by 14% and 18%, respectively, and decreased C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values of hydroxybupropion, an active metabolite of bupropion, by 32% and 24%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cimetidine:</span> The threohydrobupropion metabolite of bupropion does not appear to be produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The effects of concomitant administration of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers. Following oral administration of bupropion 300 mg with and without cimetidine 800 mg, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were unaffected. However, there were 16% and 32% increases in the AUC and C <span class="Sub">max</span>, respectively of the combined moieties of threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion.</p><p><span class="Italics">Citalopram:</span> Citalopram did not affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its three metabolites.</p><p><span class="Italics">Inducers of CYP2B6:</span> Ritonavir and Lopinavir: In a healthy volunteer trial, ritonavir 100 mg twice daily reduced the AUC and Cmax of bupropion by 22% and 21%, respectively.

Concomitant use of bupropion with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 has not been formally studied.</p><p><span class="Italics">Citalopram:</span> Although citalopram is not primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, in one trial bupropion increased the C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of citalopram by 30% and 40%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Lamotrigine:</span> Multiple oral doses of bupropion had no statistically significant effects on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine in 12 healthy volunteers.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digoxin:</span> Literature data showed that digoxin exposure was decreased when a single oral dose of 0.5-mg digoxin was administered 24 hours after a single oral dose of extended-release 150-mg bupropion in healthy volunteers.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were performed in rats and mice at bupropion doses up to 300 and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are approximately 6 and 2 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In the rat study there was an increase in nodular proliferative lesions of the liver at doses of 100 to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 to 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis); lower doses were not tested. The question of whether or not such lesions may be precursors of neoplasms of the liver is currently unresolved. Similar liver lesions were not seen in the mouse study, and no increase in malignant tumors of the liver and other organs was seen in either study.</p><p>Bupropion produced a positive response (2 to 3 times control mutation rate) in 2 of 5 strains in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay. Bupropion produced an increase in chromosomal aberrations in 1 of 3 <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow cytogenetic studies.</p><p>There were no effects on male and female fertility when rats were administered oral doses of bupropion up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) to females prior to mating and either through Day 13 of gestation or through lactation, and to males for 60 days prior to and through mating. However, doses of 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the MRHD on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater, caused transient ataxia or behavioral changes in adult female rats. There were also no adverse effects on fertility, reproduction, or growth and development of male or female offspring.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of major depressive disorder was established in two 4-week, placebo-controlled trials in adult inpatients with MDD (Trials 1 and 2 in Table 4) and in one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult outpatients with MDD (Trial 3 in Table 4). In the first trial, the dose range of bupropion hydrochloride tablets was 300 mg to 600 mg/ day administered in 3 divided doses; 78% of subjects were treated with doses of 300 mg to 450 mg/day. The trial demonstrated the efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride tablets as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score, the HDRS depressed mood item (Item 1), and the Clinical Global Impressions-severity score (CGI-S). The second trial included 2 doses of bupropion hydrochloride tablets (300 and 450 mg/day) and placebo. This trial demonstrated the effectiveness of bupropion hydrochloride tablets for only the 450 mg/day dose. The efficacy results were statistically significant for the HDRS total score and the CGI-S score, but not for HDRS Item 1. In the third trial, outpatients were treated with 300 mg/ day of bupropion hydrochloride tablets. This trial demonstrated the efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride tablets as measured by the HDRS total score, the HDRS Item 1, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the CGI-S score, and the CGI-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) score. Effectiveness of bupropion hydrochloride tablets in long-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4.

Advise families and caregivers of patients to observe for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s prescriber or healthcare professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.</p><p><span class="Bold">Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events and Suicide Risk in Smoking Cessation Treatment</span></p><p>Although bupropion hydrochloride tablet is not indicated for smoking cessation treatment, it contains the same active ingredient as ZYBAN which is approved for this use. Inform patients that some patients have experienced changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation and suicide when attempting to quit smoking while taking bupropion. Instruct patients to discontinue bupropion and contact a healthcare professional if they experience such symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Severe Allergic Reactions</span></p><p>Educate patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity and to discontinue bupropion hydrochloride tablets if they have a severe allergic reaction.</p><p><span class="Bold">Seizure</span></p><p>Instruct patients to discontinue and not restart bupropion hydrochloride tablets if they experience a seizure while on treatment. Advise patients that the excessive use or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, or sedatives/hypnotics can increase the risk of seizure. Advise patients to minimize or avoid use of alcohol.</p><p><span class="Bold">Angle-Closure Glaucoma</span></p><p>Patients should be advised that taking bupropion hydrochloride tablets can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Bupropion-Containing Products</span></p><p>Educate patients that bupropion hydrochloride tablets contains the same active ingredient (bupropion hydrochloride) found in ZYBAN, which is used as an aid to smoking cessation treatment, and that bupropion hydrochloride tablets should not be used in combination with ZYBAN or any other medications that contain bupropion (such as bupropion hydrochloride SR, the sustained-release formulation and bupropion hydrochloride XL or FORFIVO XL, the extended-release formulations, and APLENZIN, the extended-release formulation of bupropion hydrobromide). In addition, there are a number of generic bupropion HCl products for the immediate-, sustained-, and extended-release formulations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</span></p><p>Advise patients that any CNS-active drug like bupropion hydrochloride tablets may impair their ability to perform tasks requiring judgment or motor and cognitive skills. Advise patients that until they are reasonably certain that bupropion hydrochloride tablet does not adversely affect their performance, they should refrain from driving an automobile or operating complex, hazardous machinery. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets may lead to decreased alcohol tolerance.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concomitant Medications</span></p><p>Counsel patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking or plan to take any prescription or over-the-counter drugs because bupropion hydrochloride and other drugs may affect each others’ metabolisms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p><p>Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with bupropion hydrochloride tablets. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to bupropion hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Storage Information</span></p><p>Instruct patients to store bupropion hydrochloride tablets at room temperature, between 68°F and 77°F (20°C to 25°C) and keep the tablets dry and out of the light.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administration Information</span></p><p>Instruct patients to take bupropion hydrochloride tablets in equally divided doses 3 or 4 times a day, with doses separated by at least 6 hours to minimize the risk of seizure. Instruct patients if they miss a dose, not to take an extra tablet to make up for the missed dose and to take the next tablet at the regular time because of the dose-related risk of seizure. Instruct patients that bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets can be taken with or without food.</p><p>The brands listed are trademarks of their respective owners and are not trademarks of Micro Labs Limited.
