</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets immediately and avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, in patients who experience any of these serious adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ciprofloxacin Extended Release Tablets</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms in the conditions and patient populations listed below<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (Acute Cystitis)</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.</span></p><p>Because fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1</span>–<span class="Italics">5.16)]</span> and for some patients uncomplicated UTI (acute cystitis) is self-limiting, reserve ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets for treatment of uncomplicated UTIs (acute cystitis) in patients who have no alternative treatment options.</p><h3>Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, and Acute Uncomplicated Pyelonephritis</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> and acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (AUP) caused by <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets and other antibacterial drugs, ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Therapy with ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available appropriate therapy should be continued.</p><p>As with other drugs, some isolates of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ciprofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.</p><h2>Ciprofloxacin Extended Release Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets and ciprofloxacin immediate-release tablets are not interchangeable</span>. Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets should be administered orally once daily (Table 1).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Indication</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dose</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Frequency</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Usual Duration</span></p><p class="First">Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (Acute Cystitis)</p><p class="First">500 mg</p><p class="First">every 24 hours</p><p class="First">3 Days</p><p class="First">Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Acute Uncomplicated Pyelonephritis</p><p class="First">1000 mg</p><p class="First">every 24 hours</p><p class="First">7–14 Days</p><p>Patients whose therapy is started with ciprofloxacin IV for UTIs may be switched to ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician.</p><h3>Administration</h3><h3>Impaired Renal Function</h3><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Extended-Release Tablets, USP are available containing ciprofloxacin, USP and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, USP equivalent to 500 mg or 1000 mg of ciprofloxacin.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets are contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antibacterials, or any of the product components <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span></p><h3>Tizanidine</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.</p><h3>Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.</p><p>The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors.</p><p>Discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets and may be irreversible in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or other alterations in sensations including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense and vibratory sensation and/or motor strength in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span></p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychosis, psychotic reactions progressing to suicidal ideations/thoughts, hallucinations, or paranoia; depression, or self-injurious behavior such as attempted or completed suicide; anxiety, agitation, or nervousness; confusion, delirium, disorientation, or disturbances in attention; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. These reactions may occur following the first dose. Advise patients receiving ciprofloxacin to inform their healthcare provider immediately if these reactions occur, discontinue the drug, and institute appropriate care [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, like other fluoroquinolones, are known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold. Cases of status epilepticus have been reported. As with all fluoroquinolones, use ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets with caution in epileptic patients and patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, previous history of convulsion, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brain structure, or stroke), or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). If seizures occur, discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, and institute appropriate care [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including ciprofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:</p><p>Discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, including intubation, as indicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h3>Risk of Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients. The cause for the increased risk has not been identified. In patients with a known aortic aneurysm or patients who are at greater risk for aortic aneurysms, reserve ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets for use only when there are no alternative antibacterial treatments available.</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatic necrosis, life-threatening hepatic failure, and fatal events, have been reported with ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. Acute liver injury is rapid in onset (range 1–39 days), and is often associated with hypersensitivity. The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed. Most patients with fatal outcomes were older than 55 years old. In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatitis (such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen), discontinue treatment immediately.</p><p>There can be a temporary increase in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or cholestatic jaundice, especially in patients with previous liver damage, who are treated with ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Serious Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Theophylline Use</h3><p class="First">Serious and fatal reactions have been reported in patients receiving concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets and theophylline. These reactions have included cardiac arrest, seizure, status epilepticus, and respiratory failure. Instances of nausea, vomiting, tremor, irritability, or palpitation have also occurred.</p><p>Although similar serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving theophylline alone, the possibility that these reactions may be potentiated by ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets cannot be eliminated. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Clostridium Difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)-</span>associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Prolongation of the QT Interval</h3><p class="First">Some fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsade de pointes have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets.</p><p>Avoid ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, risk factors for QT prolongation or torsade de pointes (for example, congenital long QT syndrome, uncorrected electrolyte imbalance, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and cardiac disease, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or bradycardia), and patients receiving Class IA antiarrhythmic agents (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III antiarrhythmic agents (amiodarone, sotalol), tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, and antipsychotics. Elderly patients may also be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients and Arthropathic Effects in Animals</h3><p class="First">An increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls, including reactions related to joints and/or surrounding tissues, has been observed <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>In pre-clinical studies, oral administration of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets caused lameness in immature dogs. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity</h3><p class="First">Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, “V” area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of quinolones including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, avoid excessive exposure to these sources of light. Discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets if phototoxicity occurs <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Potential Risks with Concomitant Use of Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 1A2 Enzymes</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of the hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme pathway. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (for example, theophylline, methylxanthines, caffeine, tizanidine, ropinirole, clozapine, olanzapine and zolpidem) results in increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered drug and could lead to clinically significant pharmacodynamic adverse reactions of the co-administered drug <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Interference with Timely Diagnosis of Syphilis</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. Antimicrobial agents used in high dose for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. Perform a serologic test for syphilis in all patients with gonorrhea at the time of diagnosis. Perform follow-up serologic test for syphilis three months after ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets treatment.</p><h3>Crystalluria</h3><p class="First">Crystals of ciprofloxacin have been observed rarely in the urine of human subjects but more frequently in the urine of laboratory animals, which is usually alkaline <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].</span> Crystalluria related to ciprofloxacin has been reported only rarely in humans because human urine is usually acidic. Avoid alkalinity of the urine in patients receiving ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. Hydrate patients well to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>5.19 Blood Glucose Disturbances</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have been associated with disturbances of blood glucose, including symptomatic hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death have been reported. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs in a patient being treated with ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets and initiate appropriate therapy immediately [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious and otherwise important adverse drug reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Clinical trials in patients with urinary tract infections enrolled 961 patients treated with 500 mg or 1000 mg ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. The overall incidence, type and distribution of adverse reactions were similar in patients receiving both 500 mg and 1000 mg of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. The adverse reaction information from clinical studies does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</p><p>In the clinical trial of uncomplicated UTIs, ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets (500 mg once daily) in 444 patients was compared to ciprofloxacin immediate-release tablets (250 mg twice daily) in 447 patients for 3 days. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions thought to be drug-related occurred in 0.2% (1/444) of patients in the ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets arm and in 0% (0/447) of patients in the control arm.</p><p>In the clinical trial of cUTI and acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (AUP) defined as infections occurring in premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or comorbidities, ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets (1000 mg once daily) in 517 patients was compared to ciprofloxacin immediate-release tablets (500 mg twice daily) in 518 patients for 7 to 14 days. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions thought to be drug-related occurred in 3.1% (16/517) of patients in the ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets arm and in 2.3% (12/518) of patients in the control arm. The most common reasons for discontinuation in the ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets arm were nausea/vomiting (4 patients) and dizziness (3 patients). In the control arm the most common reason for discontinuation was nausea/vomiting (3 patients).</p><p>In these clinical trials, the following events occurred in ≥ 2% of all ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets patients: nausea (4%), headache (3%), dizziness (2%), diarrhea (2%), vomiting (2%) and vaginal moniliasis (2%).</p><p>Adverse reactions, judged by investigators to be at least possibly drug-related, occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of all ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets treated patients were: nausea (3%), diarrhea (2%), headache (1%), dyspepsia (1%), dizziness (1%), and vaginal moniliasis (1%).

Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to both fetus and mother. An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy by TERIS–the Teratogen Information System concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data = fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.</p><p>A controlled prospective observational study followed 200 women exposed to fluoroquinolones (52.5% exposed to ciprofloxacin and 68% first trimester exposures) during gestation. <span class="Italics">In utero</span> exposure to fluoroquinolones during embryogenesis was not associated with increased risk of major malformations. The reported rates of major congenital malformations were 2.2% for the fluoroquinolone group and 2.6% for the control group (background incidence of major malformations is 1–5%). Rates of spontaneous abortions, prematurity and low birth weight did not differ between the groups and there were no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions up to one year of age in the ciprofloxacin exposed children.</p><p>Another prospective follow-up study reported on 549 pregnancies with fluoroquinolone exposure (93% first trimester exposures). There were 70 ciprofloxacin exposures, all within the first trimester. The malformation rates among live-born babies exposed to ciprofloxacin and to fluoroquinolones overall were both within background incidence ranges. No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found. The study did not reveal any clear adverse reactions due to <span class="Italics">in utero</span> exposure to ciprofloxacin.</p><p>No differences in the rates of prematurity, spontaneous abortions, or birth weight were seen in women exposed to ciprofloxacin during pregnancy. However, these small postmarketing epidemiology studies, of which most experience is from short term, first trimester exposure, are insufficient to evaluate the risk for the less common defects or to permit reliable and definitive conclusions regarding the safety of ciprofloxacin in pregnant women and their developing fetuses.</p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (0.6 and 0.3 times the maximum daily human dose of 1000 mg based upon body surface area, respectively) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to ciprofloxacin. In rabbits, oral ciprofloxacin dose levels of 30 and 100 mg/kg (approximately 0.4- and 1.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area) produced gastrointestinal toxicity resulting in maternal weight loss and an increased incidence of abortion, but no teratogenicity was observed at either dose level. After intravenous administration of doses up to 20 mg/kg (approximately 0.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area), no maternal toxicity was produced in the rabbit, and no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk. The amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed by the nursing infant is unknown. Because of the potential risk of serious adverse reactions (including articular damage) in infants nursing from mothers taking ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets in pediatric patients and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been established. Ciprofloxacin causes arthropathy (arthralgia, arthritis) in juvenile animals <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].</span> Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets are not indicated for pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.3)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>In a large, prospective, randomized ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets clinical trial in cUTI, 49% (509/1035) of the patients were 65 and over, while 30% (308/1035) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies report an increased rate of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p>In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternate pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is required for patients with uncomplicated UTIs receiving 500 mg ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. Dosing in children (less than 18 years of age) with impaired renal function has not been studied <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been studied.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. Empty the stomach by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage. Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent crystalluria and administration of magnesium, aluminum or calcium containing antacids, which can reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (less than 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><h2>Ciprofloxacin Extended Release Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin<span class="Sup">*</span> extended-release tablets, USP contain ciprofloxacin, a synthetic antimicrobial agent for oral administration.

Studies with the oral and intravenous forms of ciprofloxacin have demonstrated penetration of ciprofloxacin into a variety of tissues. The binding of ciprofloxacin to serum proteins is 20% to 40%, which is not likely to be high enough to cause significant protein binding interactions with other drugs. Following administration of a single dose of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, ciprofloxacin concentrations in urine collected up to 4 hours after dosing averaged over 300 mg/L for both the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablets; in urine excreted from 12 to 24 hours after dosing, ciprofloxacin concentration averaged 27 mg/L for the 500 mg tablet, and 58 mg/L for the 1000 mg tablet.</p><p class="First">Four metabolites of ciprofloxacin were identified in human urine. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged ciprofloxacin. The primary metabolites are oxociprofloxacin (M3) and sulfociprofloxacin (M2), each accounting for roughly 3% to 8% of the total dose. Other minor metabolites are desethylene ciprofloxacin (M1), and formylciprofloxacin (M4). The relative proportion of drug and metabolite in serum corresponds to the composition found in urine. Excretion of these metabolites was essentially complete by 24 hours after dosing. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 mediated metabolism. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co-administered drug <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.10, 5.16) and Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p class="First">The elimination kinetics of ciprofloxacin are similar for the immediate-release and the ciprofloxacin extended-release tablet. In studies comparing the ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets and immediate-release ciprofloxacin, approximately 35% of an orally administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug for both formulations. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete within 24 hours after dosing. The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin, which is approximately 300 mL/minute, exceeds the normal glomerular filtration rate of 120 mL/minute. Thus, active tubular secretion would seem to play a significant role in its elimination. Co-administration of probenecid with immediate-release ciprofloxacin results in about a 50% reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal clearance and a 50% increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation. Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after oral dosing with the immediate-release tablet, only a small amount of the dose administered is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. An additional 1 to 2% of the dose is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites. Approximately 20 to 35% of an oral dose of immediate-release ciprofloxacin is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing. This may arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination.</p><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies of the immediate-release oral tablet (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (&gt; 65 years) as compared to young adults. C<span class="Sub">max</span> is increased 16 to 40%, and mean AUC is increased approximately 30%, which can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly.

The clinical significance of this interaction has not been determined.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">The bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV (both Type II topoisomerases), which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.</p><p class="First">The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, is different from that of other antimicrobial agents such as beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, or aminoglycosides; therefore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to fluoroquinolones occurs primarily by either mutations in the DNA gyrases, decreased outer membrane permeability, or drug efflux. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> resistance to ciprofloxacin develops slowly by multiple step mutations.

Hairless (Skh-1) mice were exposed to UVA light for 3.5 hours five times every two weeks for up to 78 weeks while concurrently being administered ciprofloxacin. The time to development of the first skin tumors was 50 weeks in mice treated concomitantly with UVA and ciprofloxacin (mouse dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily human dose of 1000 mg based upon body surface area), as opposed to 34 weeks when animals were treated with both UVA and vehicle. The times to development of skin tumors ranged from 16–32 weeks in mice treated concomitantly with UVA and other quinolones.</p><p>In this model, mice treated with ciprofloxacin alone did not develop skin or systemic tumors. There are no data from similar models using pigmented mice and/or fully haired mice. The clinical significance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p><p>Fertility studies performed in rats at oral doses of ciprofloxacin up to 100 mg/kg (1 times the highest recommended daily human dose of 1000 mg based upon body surface area) revealed no evidence of impairment.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]</span>. Damage of weight bearing joints was observed in juvenile dogs and rats. In young beagles, 100 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, given daily for 4 weeks, caused degenerative articular changes of the knee joint. At 30 mg/kg, the effect on the joint was minimal. In a subsequent study in young beagle dogs, oral ciprofloxacin doses of 30 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg given daily for 2 weeks caused articular changes which were still observed by histopathology after a treatment-free period of 5 months. At 10 mg/kg no effects on joints were observed. This dose was also not associated with arthrotoxicity after an additional treatment-free period of 5 months. In another study, removal of weight bearing from the joint reduced the lesions but did not totally prevent them.</p><p>Crystalluria, sometimes associated with secondary nephropathy, occurs in laboratory animals dosed with ciprofloxacin. This is primarily related to the reduced solubility of ciprofloxacin under alkaline conditions, which predominate in the urine of test animals; in man, crystalluria is rare since human urine is typically acidic. In rhesus monkeys, crystalluria without nephropathy has been noted after single oral doses as low as 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.1-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area. After 6 months of intravenous dosing at 10 mg/kg/day, no nephropathological changes were noted; however, nephropathy was observed after dosing at 20 mg/kg/day for the same duration (approximately 0.4 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area).</p><p>In dogs, ciprofloxacin administered at 3 and 10 mg/kg by rapid infusion injection (15 sec.) produces hypotensive effects. These effects are considered to be related to histamine release because they are partially antagonized by pyrilamine, an antihistamine. In rhesus monkeys, rapid infusion injection also produces hypotension, but the effect in this species is inconsistent and less pronounced.</p><p>In mice, concomitant administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone and indomethacin with quinolones has been reported to enhance the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones.</p><p>Ocular toxicity seen with some related drugs has not been observed in ciprofloxacin-treated animals.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (Acute Cystitis)</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs (acute cystitis) in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S. This study compared ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets (500 mg once daily for three days) with ciprofloxacin immediate-release tablets (CIPRO<span class="Sup">®</span> 250 mg two times a day (BID) for three days).

The study enrolled 1,042 patients (521 patients per treatment arm) and compared ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets (1000 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days) with immediate-release ciprofloxacin (500 mg BID for 7 to 14 days). The primary efficacy endpoint for this trial was bacteriologic eradication of the baseline organism(s) with no new infection or superinfection at 5 to 11 days post-therapy (test-of-cure or TOC) for the Per Protocol and Modified Intent-To-Treat (MITT) populations.</p><p>The Per Protocol population was defined as patients with a diagnosis of cUTI or AUP, a causative organism(s) at baseline present at ≥ 10<span class="Sup">5</span> CFU/mL, no inclusion criteria violation, a valid test-of-cure urine culture within the TOC window, an organism susceptible to study drug, no premature discontinuation or loss to follow-up, and compliance with the dosage regimen (among other criteria). More patients in the ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets arm than in the control arm were excluded from the Per Protocol population and this should be considered in the interpretation of the study results. Reasons for exclusion with the greatest discrepancy between the two arms were no valid test-of-cure urine culture, an organism resistant to the study drug, and premature discontinuation due to adverse events.</p><p>An analysis of all patients with a causative organism(s) isolated at baseline and who received study medication, defined as the MITT population, included 342 patients in the ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets arm and 324 patients in the control arm.
