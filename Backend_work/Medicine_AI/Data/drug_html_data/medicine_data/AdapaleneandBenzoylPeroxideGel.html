</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel</h2><p class="First">Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab 0.1% / 2.5% is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older.</p><h2>Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">For topical use only; adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. Apply adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab to affected areas of the face and/or trunk once daily after washing. Use swab for area of the face (e.g., forehead, chin, each cheek). Avoid the eyes, lips and mucous membranes.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab contains 1 mg (0.1%) adapalene, USP and 25 mg (2.5%) benzoyl peroxide, USP.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure</h3><p class="First">Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab.</p><h3>Local Cutaneous Reactions</h3><p class="First">Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the  medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the  severity of these adverse reactions, patients  should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of “waxing” as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying  effect and products with high concentrations  of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle are presented in Table 1:</p><p></p><p></p><p>During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide or with the vehicle once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed events.</p><p>Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating, or abrasive agents. No formal drug- drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination or benzoyl peroxide.</p><p>Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.</p><p>No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0.15 to  5 mg  adapalene/kg/day, up to 25 times  (mg/m2/day) the  maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 grams  of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. However, teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of greater than or equal to 25 mg adapalene/kg/day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD, respectively. Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats; and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits.</p><p>Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6 to  6 mg  adapalene/kg/day [25 to  59 times (mg/m2) the MRHD] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether adapalene or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when adapalene and benzoyl peroxide is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in pediatric patients under the age of 9 have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel Description</h2><p class="First">Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, 0.1%/2.5% is a 1.2g swab for topical use containing adapalene USP, 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide USP, 2.5%.</p><p>Adapalene USP, a synthetic retinoid, is a naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid-like properties. The chemical name for adapalene, USP is (6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2- naphthoic acid). It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Adapalene, USP:</p><p></p><p>Molecular formula: C<span class="Sub">​28</span>H<span class="Sub">28</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>   Molecular weight: 412.5</p><p>Benzoyl Peroxide, USP is a highly lipophilic oxidizing agent that localizes in both bacterial and keratinocyte cell membranes.<br/>
The chemical name for benzoyl peroxide, USP is dibenzoyl peroxide. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Benzoyl Peroxide, USP:</p><p></p><p>Molecular formula: C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>   Molecular weight: 242.23</p><p>Inactive ingredients: carbomer 980, docusate sodium, edetate disodium, glycerin, poloxamer 182, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, purified water, sorbitan monooleate and xanthan gum.</p><h2>Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adapalene</span></p><p>Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown.</p><p><span class="Italics">Benzoyl peroxide</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects</span></p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide applied to 1000 cm2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene Cmax and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng•h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated.</p><p>Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No carcinogenicity, photocarcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in  mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day), and in rats at oral doses  of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3, and 9 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the  MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromcytomas in the  adrenal medulla of male rats was observed.</p><p>No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25%  benzoyl  peroxide  carbopol for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol for rest of the 2 years study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol for two years.</p><p>The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown.</p><p>In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol, no increase in UV- induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks.</p><p>No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources.</p><p>Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (mouse micronucleus test).</p><p>Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been  shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells.</p><p>In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F<span class="Sub">0</span> males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F<span class="Sub">1</span> offspring.</p><p>No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12-week, multicenter, controlled clinical studies of similar design, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide to the vehicle in acne subjects. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two-grade improvement and rated ‘Clear’ and ‘Almost Clear’ at Week 12 based on the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of ‘Clear’ corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present. An IGA score of ‘Almost Clear’ corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules.</p><p>In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males.</p><p>At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of ‘Moderate’ which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3.</p><p>In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of ‘Moderate’.</p><p>The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3.</p><p>In study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide or vehicle. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non- inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of ‘Moderate’. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3.</p><p></p><p>In both Studies 1 and 2 the treatment effect was smaller in subjects with a small number of baseline lesions than in subjects with a large number of baseline lesions.</p><p></p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide swab 0.1% / 2.5% is supplied in the following size:</p><p>14 count use-of-use 1.2g swab        NDC 69150-001-14</p><h2>STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First">Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].
