Neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity with NAVELBINE.  Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 53% of patients treated with NAVELBINE at 30 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> per week. Dose adjustment due to myelosuppression occurred in 51% of patients (Study 2). In clinical trials with NAVELBINE administered at 30 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> per week, neutropenia resulted in hospitalizations for pyrexia and/or sepsis in 8% of patients. Death due to sepsis occurred in 1% of patients.  Neutropenia nadirs occur between 7 and 10 days after dosing with neutropenia count recovery usually occurring within the following 7 to 14 days.</p><p>Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of NAVELBINE. Do not administer NAVELBINE to patients with neutrophil counts &lt;1,000 cells/mm <span class="Sup">3</span>.

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under varying designs and in different patient populations, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Single Agent</span></p><p>The data below reflect exposure to NAVELBINE as a single agent administered at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on a weekly basis to 365 patients enrolled in 3 controlled studies for metastatic NSCLC and advanced breast cancer. The population included 143 previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients (Study 3) who received a median of 8 doses of NAVELBINE. The patients were aged 32 to 79 (median 61 years), 71% were male, 91% White, 48% had adenocarcinoma histology. The data also reflect exposure to NAVELBINE in 222 patients with previously treated advanced breast cancer who received a median of 10 doses of NAVELBINE. NAVELBINE is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>Selected adverse reactions reported in these studies are provided in Tables 1 and 2. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) of single agent NAVELBINE were leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, asthenia, injection site reaction, and peripheral neuropathy. The most common (≥ 5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, increased total bilirubin, AST elevation, injection site reaction and asthenia. Approximately 49% of NSCLC patients treated with NAVELBINE experienced at least one dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Thirteen percent of patients discontinued NAVELBINE due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to NAVELBINE discontinuation were asthenia, dyspnea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, myasthenia and fever.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Hematologic Adverse Reactions Experienced in &gt; 5% of Patients Receiving NAVELBINE*†:</span></p><p class="First">All patients (n=365)</p><p>(%)</p><p class="First">NSCLC (n= 143)</p><p>(%)</p><p class="First">Hospitalizations due to neutropenic complications</p><p>*Grade based on modified criteria from the National Cancer Institute version 1.</p><p>†Patients with NSCLC had not received prior chemotherapy.

Results from a single-arm study of NAVELBINE administered at the dose of 33.75 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> (for 35 patients) or at the dose of 30mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> (for 11 patients) every week during 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest was evaluated (courses of 8 weeks).Forty-six patients age 1 to 25 (median 11 years) with recurrent solid malignant tumors, including rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma (N=21 patients), neuroblastoma (N= 4 patients), and central nervous system (CNS) tumors (N=21 patients) were enrolled.  The most significant grade 3 or 4 hematological adverse reactions were neutropenia (70%) and anemia (33%). The most significant grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity adverse reactions were motor (15%) or cranial (13%) neuropathy, hypoxia (13%) and dyspnea (11%). Objective tumor response was observed in 2 out of 21 patients with  rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma.  No objective tumor response was observed in patients with CNS tumors (N=21) or neuroblastoma (N=4).</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 769 number of patients who received NAVELBINE alone and NAVELBINE in combination with Cisplatin in studies 1, 2 and 3, 247 patients were 65 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between these patients and younger patients. <span class="Italics">[see </span><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span></span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of NAVELBINE has not been evaluated, but the liver plays an important role in the metabolism of NAVELBINE. Elevations of aspartate aminotransferase occur in &gt; 60% of the patients receiving NAVELBINE alone (6% Grade 3-4). Therefore, exercise caution in patients with hepatic impairment.

Overdoses involving quantities up to 10 times the recommended dose (30 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) have been reported. The toxicities described were consistent with those listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section including paralytic ileus, stomatitis, and esophagitis. Bone marrow aplasia, sepsis, and paresis have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred following overdose of NAVELBINE. If overdosage occurs, general supportive measures together with appropriate blood transfusions, growth factors, and antibiotics should be instituted as deemed necessary by the physician.</p><h2>Navelbine Injection Description</h2><p class="First">NAVELBINE (vinorelbine) Injection contains vinorelbine, a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid.</p><p>The molecular formula for vinorelbine tartrate, USP is C <span class="Sub">45</span>H <span class="Sub">54</span>N <span class="Sub">4</span>O <span class="Sub">8</span><span class="Bold">●</span>2C <span class="Sub">4</span>H <span class="Sub">6</span>O <span class="Sub">6</span>.</p><p>It has a molecular weight of 1079.11.</p><p>The structural formula is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Vinorelbine tartrate, is a white to light yellow amorphous powder. It is easily soluble in water, very soluble in methanol, and practically insoluble in hexane.</p><p>Navelbine Injection is a sterile nonpyrogenic aqueous solution. Each milliliter of solution contains 13.85 mg vinorelbine tartrate USP equivalent to 10 mg vinorelbine in Water for Injection, USP. The pH of Navelbine Injection is approximately 3.5.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Vinorelbine is a vinca alkaloid that interferes with microtubule assembly. The antitumor activity of vinorelbine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin.  Vinorelbine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca++-transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. Vinorelbine inhibited mitotic microtubule formation in intact mouse embryo tectal plates at a concentration of 2 μM inducing a blockade of cells at metaphase, but produced depolymerization of axonal microtubules at a concentration</p><p>40 μM, suggesting a modest selectivity of vinorelbine for mitotic microtubules.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine were studied in 49 patients who received doses of 30 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> administered as 15- to 20-minute constant-rate infusions. Vinorelbine concentrations in plasma decay in a triphasic manner.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Steady-state volume of distribution (V <span class="Sub">SS</span>) values range from 25.4 to 40.1 L/kg. Vinorelbine demonstrated high binding to human platelets and lymphocytes. The free fraction was approximately 0.11 in human plasma over a concentration range of 234 to 1169 ng/mL. The binding to plasma constituents in cancer patients ranged from 79.6% to 91.2%. Vinorelbine binding was not altered in the presence of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, or doxorubicin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The terminal phase half-life averages 27.7 to 43.6 hours and the mean plasma clearance ranges from 0.97 to 1.26 L/hr/kg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Vinorelbine undergoes substantial hepatic elimination in humans, with large amounts recovered in feces. Two metabolites of vinorelbine have been identified in human blood, plasma, and urine; vinorelbine N-oxide and deacetylvinorelbine. Deacetylvinorelbine has been demonstrated to be the primary metabolite of vinorelbine in humans, and has been shown to possess antitumor activity similar to vinorelbine. Therapeutic doses of vinorelbine (30 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>) yield very small, if any, quantifiable levels of either metabolite in blood or urine. The metabolism of vinorelbine is mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in the CYP3A subfamily.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>After intravenous administration of radioactive vinorelbine, approximately 18% and 46% of administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively. In a different study, 10.9% <span class="Bold">+</span> 0.7% of a 30-mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> intravenous dose was excreted as parent drug in urine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Elderly: Age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics (CL, V <span class="Sub">SS</span> and t <span class="Sub">1/2</span>) of vinorelbine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine are not influenced by the concurrent administration of cisplatin.</p><h2>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">The carcinogenic potential of NAVELBINE has not been studied. Vinorelbine has been shown to affect chromosome number and possibly structure <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (polyploidy in bone marrow cells from Chinese hamsters and a positive micronucleus test in mice). It was not mutagenic in the Ames test and gave inconclusive results in the mouse lymphoma TK Locus assay.</p><p>Vinorelbine did not affect fertility to a statistically significant extent when administered to rats on either a once-weekly (9 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>, approximately one third the human dose) or alternate-day schedule (4.2 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>, approximately 0.14 times the human recommended dose) prior to and during mating. In male rats, administration of vinorelbine twice weekly for 13 or 26 weeks at dose levels of 2.1 and 7.2 mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> (approximately 0.07 and 0.24 times the recommended human  dose), respectively, resulted in decreased spermatogenesis and prostate/seminal vesicle secretion.</p><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><h3>Combination Use with Cisplatin</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of NAVELBINE in combination with cisplatin was evaluated in two randomized, multicenter trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cisplatin 100mg/m</span><span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>Study 1 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of NAVELBINE plus cisplatin and cisplatin alone for the treatment of stage IV or stage IIIb NSCLC patients with malignant pleural effusion or multiple lesions in more than one lobe of the ipsilateral lung who had not received prior chemotherapy.
