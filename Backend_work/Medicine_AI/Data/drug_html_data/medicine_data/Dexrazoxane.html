Extravasation happens when an injected medicine escapes from the blood vessels and circulates into tissues in the body. Serious tissue damage can occur when extravasation happens during injection of certain cancer medications.</p><p>Dexrazoxane is also used to help prevent chemotherapy-related heart problems in women who are receiving doxorubicin for metastatic breast cancer.  dexrazoxane is given only after you have received enough doxorubicin infusions to amount to a certain total dose.</p><p>Dexrazoxane may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Dexrazoxane can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects if the mother or father is using this medicine. Tell your caregivers if you are pregnant, or if you are a man and your sex partner is able to get pregnant.</p><p>You should not receive <b>Zinecard</b> if your chemotherapy does not include doxorubicin or a similar medication (such as daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone).</p><p>Tell your doctor at once if you have signs of infection such as fever, chills, sore throat, easy bruising or bleeding, skin sores, or warmth and redness of any surgical incision.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive <b>Zinecard</b> if your chemotherapy does not include doxorubicin or a similar medication such as:</p><ul>

</ul><p>heart problems;</p><p>liver disease; or</p><p>kidney disease.</p><p>Dexrazoxane can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects <b>if the mother or the father is receiving  dexrazoxane.</b> Women should use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy while receiving dexrazoxane and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Men should use birth control during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose. Tell your doctor right away if a pregnancy occurs during this time.</p><p>This medicine may affect fertility (ability to have children) in men. However, it is important to use birth control to prevent pregnancy because dexrazoxane may harm the baby if a pregnancy does occur.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while you are using dexrazoxane. Women receiving <b>Totect</b> should continue to not breastfeed for at least 2 weeks after the last dose.</p><h2>How is dexrazoxane given?</h2><p>Dexrazoxane is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Totect is usually started within 6 hours after extravasation, and continued once daily for 3 days.</p><p>Dexrazoxane is usually started 15 minutes before you receive your doxorubicin infusion. This medicine is not given with your first dose of doxorubicin, but only after you've received prior doxorubicin doses up to a certain total amount.</p><p>Dexrazoxane can add to bone marrow suppression caused by chemotherapy. You may get infections more easily, even serious or fatal infections. Your doctor will need to examine you on a regular basis.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since dexrazoxane is given by a healthcare professional as part of your chemotherapy treatment, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss your chemotherapy appointment.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving dexrazoxane?</h2><p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections.
