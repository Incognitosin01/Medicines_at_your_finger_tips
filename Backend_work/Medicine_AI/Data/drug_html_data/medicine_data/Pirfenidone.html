IPF causes scar tissue to form deep within your lungs. The scar tissue thickens and becomes stiff or thick over time, which can make it harder for your lungs to work. Decreased lung function can make it hard for you to breathe. Other medical problems can occur when your brain, heart, and other organs do not get enough oxygen.</p><p>The cause of IPF is often unknown, but this condition is a progressive disease that can be fatal. Pirfenidone is not a cure for IPF, but  pirfenidone may slow the progress of this disease.</p><p>Pirfenidone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
