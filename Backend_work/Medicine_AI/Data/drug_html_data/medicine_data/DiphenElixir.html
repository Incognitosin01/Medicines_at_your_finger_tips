</ul><h2>Diphen Elixir Description</h2><p class="First">Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine drug having the chemical name 2-(diphenylmethoxy)-N,N -dimethylethylamine hydrochloride and has the molecular formula C <span class="Sub">17</span>H <span class="Sub">21</span>NO∙HCl (molecular weight 291.82). It occurs as a white odorless, crystalline powder and is freely soluble in water and alcohol. The structural formula is as follows:</p><p>Each 5 mL contains 12.5 mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride and alcohol 14% for oral administration. Inactive Ingredients: Citric acid, D&amp;C Red No. 33, FD&amp;C Red No. 40, flavoring, purified water, sodium citrate, and sucrose.</p><h2>Diphen Elixir - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic (drying) and sedative effects. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells.</p><p>A single oral dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride is quickly absorbed with maximum activity occurring in approximately one hour. The duration of activity following an average dose of diphenhydramine hydrochloride is from four to six hours. Diphenhydramine is widely distributed throughout the body, including the CNS. Little, if any, is excreted unchanged in the urine; most appears as the degradation products of metabolic transformation in the liver, which are almost completely excreted within 24 hours.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Diphen Elixir</h2><p class="First">Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is effective for the following indications:</p><h3>Antihistaminic</h3><p class="First">For allergic conjunctivitis due to foods; mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema; amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma; dermatographism; as therapy for anaphylactic reactions <span class="Italics">adjunctive</span> to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute manifestations have been controlled.</p><h3>Motion Sickness</h3><p class="First">For active and prophylactic treatment of motion sickness.</p><h3>Antiparkinsonism</h3><p class="First">For parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in the elderly unable to tolerate more potent agents; mild cases of parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in other age groups; in other cases of parkinsonism (including drug-induced) in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nighttime Sleep-aid.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Use in Neonates or Premature Infants</h3><p class="First">This drug should <span class="Italics">not</span> be used in neonates or premature infants.</p><h3>Use in Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally, and for neonates and prematures in particular, antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers.</p><h3>Antihistamines are also contraindicated in the following conditions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction.</p><h3>Use in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in <span class="Italics">overdosage</span> may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death. As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation.</p><h3>Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older)</h3><p class="First">Antihistamines are most likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Diphen Elixir has an atropine-like action and therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients taking Diphen Elixir should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol. Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Diphen Elixir has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.). MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Diphen Elixir should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></span>).</p><p>Diphen Elixir may diminish mental alertness, or, in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions, or death (see <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE</span></span>).</p><p>See also <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> section.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The most frequent adverse reactions are underscored.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-430-7499 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Antihistamine overdosage reactions may vary from central nervous system depression to stimulation. Stimulation is particularly likely in pediatric patients. Atropine-like signs and symptoms, dry mouth; fixed, dilated pupils; flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur.</p><p><span class="Italics">If vomiting has not occurred spontaneously,</span> the patient should be induced to vomit. This is best done by having him drink a glass of water or milk after which he should be made to gag. Precaution against aspiration must be taken, especially in infants and children.</p><p><span class="Italics">If vomiting is unsuccessful,</span> gastric lavage is indicated within 3 hours after ingestion and even later if large amounts of milk or cream were given beforehand. Isotonic or 1/2 isotonic saline is the lavage solution of choice.</p><p><span class="Italics">Saline cathartics,</span> as milk of magnesia, by osmosis draw water into the bowel and therefore are valuable for their action in rapid dilution of bowel content.</p><p><span class="Italics">Stimulants</span> should not be used.</p><p>Vasopressors may be used to treat hypotension.</p><h2>Diphen Elixir Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">DOSAGE SHOULD BE INDIVIDUALIZED ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.</p><p>A single oral dose of Diphen Elixir is quickly absorbed with maximum activity occurring in approximately one hour. The duration of activity following an average dose of Diphen Elixir is from four to six hours.</p><p>Always use a calibrated measuring device when administering Diphen Elixir to ensure the dose is measured and administered accurately.</p><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">Take 10 mL - 20 mL (25mg-50mg) three or four times daily. The nighttime sleep-aid dosage is 20 mL (50mg) at bedtime. Maximum daily dosage not to exceed 120 mL (300mg).</p><h3>Pediatric Patients (over 20 lbs.)</h3><p class="First">Take 5 mL to 10 mL (12.5mg-25mg) three to four times daily. Maximum daily dosage not to exceed 120 mL (300mg). For physicians who wish to calculate the dose on the basis of body weight or surface area, the recommended dosage is 5 mg/kg/24 hours or 150 mg/m2/24 hours.</p><p>Data are not available on the use of Diphen Elixir as a nighttime sleep-aid in children under 12 years.</p><p>The basis for determining the most effective dosage regimen will be the response of the patient to medication and the condition under treatment.</p><p>In motion sickness, full dosage is recommended for prophylactic use, the first dose to be given 30 minutes before exposure to motion and similar doses before meals and upon retiring for the duration of exposure.</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).
