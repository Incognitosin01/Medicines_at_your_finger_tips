</ul><h2>OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</h2><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Bamlanivimab is not renally excreted or metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Bamlanivimab should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus.</p><p>Nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with bamlanivimab. In a tissue cross reactivity study with bamlanivimab using human fetal tissues, no binding of clinical concern was detected. Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, bamlanivimab has the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing fetus. It is unknown whether the potential transfer of bamlanivimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on the presence of bamlanivimab in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for bamlanivimab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from bamlanivimab or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID-19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID-19.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of bamlanivimab have not been assessed in pediatric patients. The recommended dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of bamlanivimab in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg as observed in adults, based on a pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling approach which accounted for effect of body weight changes associated with age on clearance and volume of distribution.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 309 patients receiving bamlanivimab in BLAZE-1, 11% were 65 years of age and older and 3% were 75 years of age and older. Based on population PK analyses, there is no difference in PK in geriatric patients compared to younger patients.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Bamlanivimab is not eliminated intact in the urine, thus renal impairment is not expected to affect the exposure of bamlanivimab.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Based on population PK analysis, there is no significant difference in PK of bamlanivimab in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Bamlanivimab has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.</p><h3>Other Specific Populations</h3><p class="First">Based on population PK analysis, the PK of bamlanivimab was not affected by sex, race, or disease severity. Body weight had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of bamlanivimab in adults with COVID-19 over the body weight range of 41 kg to 173 kg.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Doses up to 7,000 mg (10 times the recommended dose) have been administered in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. Treatment of overdose with bamlanivimab should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose with bamlanivimab.</p><h2>Bamlanivimab Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Bamlanivimab is a human immunoglobulin G-1 (IgG1 variant) monoclonal antibody consisting of 2 identical light chain polypeptides composed of 214 amino acids each and 2 identical heavy chain polypeptides composed of 455 amino acids produced by a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line and molecular weight of 146 kDa.</p><p>Bamlanivimab Injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow to slightly brown solution in a single-dose vial for intravenous infusion after dilution.</p><p>Each mL contains 35 mg of bamlanivimab, and L-histidine (0.4 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (0.6 mg), sodium chloride (2.9 mg), sucrose (60 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.5 mg), and Water for Injection. The bamlanivimab solution has a pH range of 5.5-6.5.</p><h2>Bamlanivimab Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Bamlanivimab is a recombinant neutralizing human IgG1<span class="Sub">K</span> monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and is unmodified in the Fc region. Bamlanivimab binds to spike protein with a dissociation constant K<span class="Sub">D</span> = 0.071 nM and blocks spike protein attachment to the human ACE2 receptor with an IC<span class="Sub">50</span> value of 0.025 μg/mL.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A Phase 2 trial evaluated bamlanivimab over a dose range of 1 to 10 times the recommended dose (700 to 7000 mg) of bamlanivimab in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. A flat exposure-response relationship for efficacy was identified for bamlanivimab within this dose range, based on viral load and clinical outcomes.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic profile of bamlanivimab is linear and dose-proportional between 700 mg and 7000 mg following a single IV administration. There were no differences in PK of bamlanivimab between severe/moderate participants who were hospitalized and mild/moderate ambulatory participants.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The mean maximum concentration (Cmax) of 700 mg bamlanivimab was 196 μg/mL (90% CI: 102 to 378 μg/mL) following approximately 1 hour 700 mg IV infusion.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Bamlanivimab mean volume of distribution (V) was 2.87 L and 2.71 L for the central and peripheral compartments, respectively.

Bamlanivimab retained activity against pseudovirus expressing del69-70 + N501Y found in the B.1.1.7 variant (UK origin).</p><p>Genotypic and phenotypic testing are ongoing to monitor for potential bamlanivimab-resistance-associated spike variations in clinical trials. Known bamlanivimab-resistant variants at baseline were observed at a frequency of 0.27% (1/375) in the clinical trial BLAZE-1. In the same trial, treatment-emergent variants were detected at spike protein amino acid positions E484, F490 and S494, and included E484A/D/G/K/Q/V, F490L/S/V and S494L/P; only E484K/Q, F490S and S494P have been assessed phenotypically to date. Considering all variants detected at positions E484, F490 and S494, 9.2% (9/98) and 6.1% (6/98) of participants in the 700 mg bamlanivimab arm harbored such a variant post-baseline at ≥15% and ≥50% allele fractions, respectively, compared with 8.2% (8/97) and 4.1% (4/97), respectively, of participants in the placebo arm. Most of these variants were first detected on Day 7 following treatment initiation and many were detected only at a single time point (700 mg arm: 5/9 and 2/6 at ≥15% and ≥50% allele fractions, respectively; placebo arm: 8/8 and 4/4, respectively). For the 700 mg bamlanivimab arm, these variants were detected more frequently in high-risk participants (14.0% [6/43] and 9.3% [4/43] at ≥15% and ≥50% allele fractions, respectively, vs 2.4% [1/41] and 0% [0/41], respectively, in the placebo arm). The clinical relevance of these findings is not known.</p><p>It is possible that bamlanivimab resistance-associated variants could have cross-resistance to other mAbs targeting the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The clinical impact is not known.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Immune Response Attenuation</span></p><p>There is a theoretical risk that antibody administration may attenuate the endogenous immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and make patients more susceptible to re-infection.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><p class="First">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and reproductive toxicology studies with bamlanivimab have not been conducted.</p><p>In toxicology studies in rats, bamlanivimab had no adverse effects when administered intravenously. Non-adverse increases in neutrophils were observed.</p><p>In tissue cross reactivity studies using human adult and fetal tissues, no binding of clinical concern was detected.</p><h2>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGIC AND EFFICACY DATA</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">In Vivo Efficacy Pharmacology</span></p><p>Prophylactic administration of bamlanivimab to female Rhesus macaques (n=3 or 4 per group) resulted in 1 to 4 log<span class="Sub">10</span> decreases in viral load (genomic RNA) and viral replication (sub-genomic RNA) in bronchoalveolar lavage samples relative to control animals, but less of an impact on viral RNA in throat and nasal swabs following SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. The applicability of these findings to a prophylaxis or treatment setting is not known.</p><h2>CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR EUA</h2><h3>Mild to Moderate COVID-19 (BLAZE-1)</h3><p class="First">The data supporting this EUA are based on an interim analysis from BLAZE-1 that occurred after all enrolled subjects completed at least Day 29 of the trial. BLAZE-1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying bamlanivimab for the treatment of subjects with mild to moderate COVID-19 (subjects with COVID-19 symptoms who are not hospitalized). BLAZE-1 enrolled adult patients who were not hospitalized and had at least 1 or more COVID-19 symptoms that were at least mild in severity. Treatment was initiated within 3 days of obtaining the clinical sample for the first positive SARS-CoV-2 viral infection determination. Subjects were treated with a single infusion of bamlanivimab (at doses of 700 mg [N=101], 2,800 mg [N=107], or 7,000 mg [N=101]) or placebo (N=156).</p><p>At baseline, median age was 45 years (with 12% of subjects aged 65 or older); 55% of subjects were female, 88% were White, 44% were Hispanic or Latino, and 6% were Black; 44% of subjects were considered high risk (as defined in Section 2). Subjects had mild (76%) to moderate COVID-19 (24%); the mean duration of symptoms was 5 days; mean viral load by cycle threshold (CT) was 24 at baseline. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across bamlanivimab and placebo treatment groups.</p><p>The pre-specified primary endpoint in this Phase 2 trial was change in viral load from baseline to Day 11 for bamlanivimab versus placebo. Most subjects, including those receiving placebo, effectively cleared virus by Day 11 (Figure 1).</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 viral load change from baseline by visit.</p><p>While viral load was used to define the primary endpoint in this Phase 2 trial, the most important evidence that bamlanivimab may be effective came from the predefined secondary endpoint of COVID-19-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits within 28 days after treatment. A lower proportion of bamlanivimab-treated subjects progressed to COVID-19-related hospitalization or emergency room visits compared to placebo-treated subjects (Table 3). Results for this endpoint were suggestive of a relatively flat dose-response relationship.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> N = number of treated patients in analysis.</p><p>The absolute risk reduction for bamlanivimab compared to placebo is greater in subjects at higher risk of hospitalization according to the high risk criteria (Table 4).</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> N = number of treated patients in analysis.</p><p>The median time to symptom improvement as recorded in a trial specific daily symptom diary was 6 days for bamlanivimab-treated subjects, as compared with 8 days for placebo-treated subjects. Symptoms assessed were cough, shortness of breath, feeling feverish, fatigue, body aches and pains, sore throat, chills, and headache. Symptom improvement was defined as symptoms scored as moderate or severe at baseline being scored as mild or absent, and symptoms scored as mild or absent at baseline being scored as absent.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">How Supplied</span></p><p>Bamlanivimab Injection is a sterile, preservative-free clear to opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow to slightly brown solution supplied in a single-dose vial.</p><p>Bamlanivimab is supplied as:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage and Handling</span></p><p>Bamlanivimab is preservative-free.

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of Bamlanivimab for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)</span></p><p>You are being given a medicine called <span class="Bold">bamlanivimab</span> for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This Fact Sheet contains information to help you understand the potential risks and potential benefits of taking bamlanivimab, which you may receive.</p><p>Receiving bamlanivimab may benefit certain people with COVID-19.</p><p>Read this Fact Sheet for information about bamlanivimab. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions. It is your choice to receive bamlanivimab or stop it at any time.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is COVID-19?</span></p><p>COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. People can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.</p><p>COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</span></p><p>The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness including breathing problems can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is bamlanivimab?</span></p><p>Bamlanivimab is an investigational medicine used to treat mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg)), and who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms or the need for hospitalization. Bamlanivimab is investigational because it is still being studied. There is limited information known about the safety or effectiveness of using bamlanivimab to treat people with COVID-19.</p><p>The FDA has authorized the emergency use of bamlanivimab for the treatment of COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). For more information on EUA, see the section “<span class="Bold">What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?</span>” at the end of this Fact Sheet.</p><p><span class="Bold">What should I tell my healthcare provider before I receive bamlanivimab?</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Have any allergies</li>
<li>Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant</li>
<li>Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed</li>
<li>Have any serious illnesses</li>
<li>Are taking any medications (prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, and herbal products)</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">How will I receive bamlanivimab?</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Bamlanivimab is given to you through a vein (intravenous or IV).</li>
<li>You will receive one dose of bamlanivimab by IV infusion. The infusion will take 16 – 60 minutes or longer. Your healthcare provider will determine the duration of your infusion.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">What are the important possible side effects of bamlanivimab?</span></p><p>Possible side effects of bamlanivimab are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can happen during and after infusion with bamlanivimab. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of allergic reactions: fever, chills, nausea, headache, shortness of breath, low or high blood pressure, rapid or slow heart rate, chest discomfort or pain, weakness, confusion, feeling tired, wheezing, swelling of your lips, face, or throat, rash including hives, itching, muscle aches, dizziness, and sweating. These reactions may be severe or life threatening.</li>
<li>Worsening symptoms after bamlanivimab: You may experience new or worsening symptoms after infusion, including fever, difficulty breathing, rapid or slow heart rate, tiredness, weakness or confusion. If these occur, contact your healthcare provider or seek immediate medical attention as some of these events have required hospitalization. It is unknown if these events are related to bamlanivimab infusion or are due to the progression of COVID-19.</li>
</ul><p>The side effects of getting any medicine by vein may include brief pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, and possible infection at the infusion site.</p><p>These are not all the possible side effects of bamlanivimab. Not a lot of people have been given bamlanivimab. Serious and unexpected side effects may happen. Bamlanivimab is still being studied so it is possible that all of the risks are not known at this time.</p><p>It is possible that bamlanivimab could interfere with your body's own ability to fight off a future infection of SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, bamlanivimab may reduce your body's immune response to a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Specific studies have not been conducted to address these possible risks. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions.</p><p><span class="Bold">What other treatment choices are there?</span></p><p>Like bamlanivimab, FDA may allow for the emergency use of other medicines to treat people with COVID-19. Go to <span class="Bold">https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/</span> for information on the emergency use of other medicines that are not approved by FDA to treat people with COVID-19. Your healthcare provider may talk with you about clinical trials you may be eligible for.</p><p>It is your choice to be treated or not to be treated with bamlanivimab. Should you decide not to receive bamlanivimab or stop it at any time, it will not change your standard medical care.</p><p><span class="Bold">What if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?</span></p><p>There is limited experience treating pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers with bamlanivimab. For a mother and unborn baby, the benefit of receiving bamlanivimab may be greater than the risk from the treatment.

</ul><p><span class="Bold">What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?</span></p><p>The United States FDA has made bamlanivimab available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Bamlanivimab has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The EUA for bamlanivimab is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of these products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the product may no longer be used).</p><p>Literature revised January 28, 2021</p><p><span class="Bold">Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN 46285, USA<br/></span> Copyright © 2020, 2021, Eli Lilly and Company.
