<span class="Bold">CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warning and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence( 9.2, 9.3)]</span> .</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Methylphenidate LA Capsules</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span> .</p><h2>Methylphenidate LA Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Pretreatment Screening</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating treatment with central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, assess for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history including family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical examination) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> .</p><p>Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and periodically reevaluate the need for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules use <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span> .</p><h3>General Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">The recommended starting dose for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsule is 20 mg once daily. Increase dosage gradually, in increments of 10 mg weekly. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended. When a lower initial dose is appropriate, patients may begin treatment with 10 mg.</p><p>Administer methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules orally once daily in the morning. Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules may be swallowed as whole capsules or may be administered by sprinkling the capsule contents on a small amount of applesauce <span class="Italics">(see specific instructions below).</span>Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules and/or their contents should not be crushed, chewed, or divided.</p><p>The capsules may be carefully opened and the beads sprinkled over a spoonful of applesauce. The applesauce should not be warm because it could affect the modified release properties of this formulation. The mixture of drug and applesauce should be consumed immediately in its entirety. The drug and applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use.</p><p>Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. Periodically reevaluate the long-term use of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and adjust dosage as needed.</p><h3>Patients Currently Using Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Tablets and Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for patients currently taking methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets twice daily or methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets is provided below.</p><p><span class="Bold">TABLE 1: Recommended Dose Conversion from Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Tablets and Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets</span></p><h3>Switching from other Methylphenidate Products</h3><p class="First">If switching from other methylphenidate products, discontinue that treatment, and titrate with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules using the titration schedule.</p><p>Do not substitute for other methylphenidate products on a milligram-per-milligram basis, because different methylphenidate base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles <span class="Italics">[see Description (11), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><p>Clinical judgment should be used when selecting the starting dose. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended.</p><h3>Dose Reduction and Discontinuation</h3><p class="First">If paradoxical worsening of symptoms or other adverse reactions occur, reduce the dosage, or, if necessary, discontinue methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules.

<li>Hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other components of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with methylphenidate <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></li>
<li>Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with an MAOI, because of the risk of hypertensive crises <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Potential for Abuse and Dependence</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Drug Abuse and Dependence(9.2, 9.3)].</span></p><h3>Serious Cardiovascular Reactions</h3><p class="First">Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules treatment.</p><h3>Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 bpm). Individuals may have larger increases. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia.</p><h3>Psychiatric Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Exacerbation of Preexisting Psychosis</span></p><p>CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder.</p><p><span class="Bold">Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder</span></p><p>CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed mood episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression).</p><p><span class="Bold">New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms</span></p><p>CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.</p><h3>Priapism</h3><p class="First">Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.</p><h3>Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud’s Phenomenon</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</p><h3>Long-Term Suppression of Growth</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.</p><p>Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.</p><p>Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, Patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</p><h3>Risk of Allergic Reactions Due to Tartrazine</h3><p class="First">This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The clinical program for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules consisted of 6 studies: 2 controlled clinical studies conducted in children with ADHD aged 6 to 12 years and 4 clinical pharmacology studies conducted in healthy adult volunteers. These studies included a total of 256 subjects; 195 children with ADHD and 61 healthy adult volunteers. The subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in doses of 10 to 40 mg per day. Safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules was assessed by evaluating frequency and nature of adverse events, routine laboratory tests, vital signs, and body weight. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in children with ADHD aged 6 to 12 years. All subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for up to 4 weeks, and had their dose optimally adjusted, prior to entering the double-blind phase of the trial. In the 2-week double-blind treatment phase of this study, patients received either placebo or methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules at their individually-titrated dose (range 10 mg to 40 mg).</p><p>Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 5% during the initial 4-week single-blind methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules titration period of this study were headache, insomnia, upper abdominal pain, appetite decreased, and anorexia.</p><p>Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 2% among methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules-treated subjects, during the 2-week double blind phase of the clinical study, are shown in Table 2:</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Adverse Reactions in Greater Than 2%</span> <span class="Bold">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules</span><span class="Bold">-Treated Subjects in the 2-Week Double-Blind Phase</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment</span></p><p>In the 2-week double-blind treatment phase of a placebo-controlled parallel-group study in children with ADHD, one methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules -treated subject (1/65, 1.5%) discontinued due to an adverse event (depressed mood).</p><p>In the single-blind titration period of this study, subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for up to 4 weeks. During this period a total of 6 subjects (6/161, 3.7%) discontinued due to adverse events. The adverse events leading to discontinuation were anger (2 patients), hypomania, anxiety, depressed mood, fatigue, migraine and lethargy.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post approval use of methylphenidate products. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Reported with methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations:</span> nasopharyngitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and the Lymphatic System Disorders:</span> leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune System Disorders:</span> hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders:</span> decreased appetite, reduced weight gain, and suppression of growth during prolonged use in children</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, agitation, psychosis (sometimes with visual and tactile hallucinations), depressed mood</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System Disorders:</span> headache, dizziness, tremor, dyskinesia including choreoathetoid movements, drowsiness, convulsions, cerebrovascular disorders (including vasculitis, cerebral hemorrhages and cerebrovascular accidents), serotonin syndrome in combination with serotonergic drugs</p><p><span class="Italics">Eye Disorders:</span> blurred vision, difficulties in visual accommodation</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac Disorders:</span> tachycardia, palpitations, increased blood pressure, arrhythmias, angina pectoris</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders:</span> cough<br/>

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADHD medications, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules during pregnancy.Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy registry for ADHD medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visit https://womensmentalhealth.org/adhd-medications/.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Published studies and postmarketing reports on methylphenidate use during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There may be risks to the fetus associated with the use of CNS stimulants use during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). No effects on morphological development were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10 and 15 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. However, spina bifida was observed in rabbits at a dose 52 times the MRHD given to adolescents. A decrease in pup body weight was observed in a pre- and post-natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses 6 times the MRHD given to adolescents (see Data).</span></p><p><span class="Italics">The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">CNS stimulants such as methylphenidate hydrochloride, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. No fetal and/or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy; however, premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine-dependent mothers.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span><br/></p><p><span class="Italics">In embryo-fetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 75 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. Malformations (increased incidence of fetal spina bifida) were observed in rabbits at the highest dose, which is approximately 52 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rabbits was 60 mg/kg/day (15 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). There was no evidence of morphological development effects in rats, although increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen at the highest dose level (10 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis), which was also maternally toxic. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rats was 25 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). When methylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 45 mg/kg/day, offspring body weight gain was decreased at the highest dose (6 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis), but no other effects on postnatal development were observed. The no effect level for pre- and postnatal development in rats was 15 mg/kg/day (~2 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</span></p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published literature, based on milk sampling from seven mothers reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, insomnia, anorexia, and reduced weight gain.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for the treatment of ADHD have been established in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years.</p><p><br/>
The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in pediatric patients less than 6 years have not been established. The long-term efficacy of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in pediatric patients has not been established.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Long-Term Suppression of Growth</span><br/>
<br/>
Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span></p><p>Rats treated with methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. A deficit in acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In a study conducted in young rats, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal Week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal Weeks 13 to 14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater, and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose (8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The clinical significance of the long-term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules has not been studied in the geriatric population.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules contains methylphenidate hydrochloride, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, have a high potential for abuse.

The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomers. The <span class="Italics">d-threo</span> enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the <span class="Italics">l-threo</span> enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>A formal QT study has not been conducted in patients taking methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules.</p><p>The effect of dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of methylphenidate hydrochloride, on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open-label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of dexmethylphenidate XR 40mg (maximum recommended adult total daily dosage) in 75 healthy volunteers. ECGs were collected up to 12 hours postdose. Frederica’s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was less than 5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval (CI) was below 10 ms for all time matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident-exposure response relationship.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules produces a bi-modal plasma concentration-time profile (i.e., 2 distinct peaks approximately 4 hours apart) when administered orally to children diagnosed with ADHD and healthy adults.</p><p>No accumulation of methylphenidate is expected following multiple once daily oral dosing with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, however, there is a slight upward trend in the methylphenidate area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (C <span class="Sub">max1</span> and C <span class="Sub">max2</span>) after oral administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules 20 mg and 40 mg capsules to adults.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The absolute oral bioavailability of methylphenidate in children was 22 ± 8% for d-methylphenidate and 5 ± 3% for l-methylphenidate.The relative bioavailability of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules given once daily is comparable to the same total dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses 4 hours apart in both children and adults.</p><p>The initial rate of absorption for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules is similar to that of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets as shown by the similar rate parameters between the 2 formulations, i.e., initial lag time (T <span class="Sub">lag</span>), first peak concentration (C <span class="Sub">max1</span>), and time to the first peak (T <span class="Sub">max1</span>), which is reached in 1 to 3 hours. The mean time to the interpeak minimum (T <span class="Sub">minip</span>), and time to the second peak (T <span class="Sub">max2</span>) are also similar for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules given once daily and methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses 4 hours apart (see Figure 1 and Table 1), although the ranges observed are greater for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules.</p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules given once daily exhibits a lower second peak concentration (C <span class="Sub">max2</span>), higher interpeak minimum concentrations (C <span class="Sub">minip</span>), and less peak and trough fluctuations than methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets given in 2 doses given 4 hours apart. This is due to an earlier onset and more prolonged absorption from the delayed-release beads <span class="Italics">(see Figure 1 and Table 4).</span><br/>

<br/>
<span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>Administration times relative to meals and meal composition may need to be individually titrated.</p><p>When methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules was administered with a high fat breakfast to adults, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules had a longer lag time until absorption began and variable delays in the time until the first peak concentration, the time until the interpeak minimum, and the time until the second peak. The first peak concentration and the extent of absorption were unchanged after food relative to the fasting state, although the second peak was approximately 25% lower. The effect of a high fat lunch was not examined.</p><p>There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules when administered with applesauce, compared to administration in the fasting condition. There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Alcohol</span></p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study was conducted to explore the effect of alcohol on the release characteristics of methylphenidate from the methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules 40 mg capsule dosage form. At an alcohol concentration of 40% there was a 98% release of methylphenidate in the first hour. The results with the 40 mg capsule are considered to be representative of the other available capsule strengths.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Binding to plasma proteins is low (10% to 33%). The volume of distribution was 2.65 ± 1.11 L/kg for d-methylphenidate and 1.80 ± 0.91 L/kg for l-methylphenidate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The systemic clearance is 0.40 ± 0.12 L/h/kg for d-methylphenidate and 0.73 ± 0.28 L/h/kg for l-methylphenidate. In studies with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules and methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in adults, methylphenidate from methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets is eliminated from plasma with an average half-life of about 3.5 hours, (range 1.3 to 7.7 hours). In children the average half-life is about 2.5 hours, with a range of about 1.5 to 5 hours. The rapid half-life in both children and adults may result in un-measurable concentrations between the morning and mid-day doses with methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. No accumulation of methylphenidate is expected following multiple once a day oral dosing with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. The half-life of ritalinic acid is about 3 to 4 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>The absolute oral bioavailability of methylphenidate in children was 22 ± 8% for d-methylphenidate and 5 ± 3% for l-methylphenidate, suggesting pronounced presystemic metabolism. Biotransformation of methylphenidate by the carboxylesterase CES1A1 is rapid and extensive leading to the main, de-esterified metabolite α-phenyl-2-piperidine acetic acid (ritalinic acid), which has little or no pharmacologic activity. Only small amounts of hydroxylated metabolites (e.g., hydroxymethylphenidate and hydroxyritalinic acid) are detectable in plasma. Therapeutic activity is principally due to the parent compound.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>After oral administration of an immediate release formulation of methylphenidate, 78% to 97% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 1% to 3% in the feces in the form of metabolites within 48 to 96 hours. Only small quantities (less than 1%) of unchanged methylphenidate appear in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted in the urine as ritalinic acid (60% to 86%), the remainder being accounted for by minor metabolite.</p><p><span class="Bold">Studies in Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Male and Female Patients</span></p><p>There were no apparent gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate between healthy male and female adults when administered methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules.</p><p><span class="Italics">Racial or Ethnic Groups</span></p><p>There is insufficient experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules was examined in 18 children with ADHD between 7 and 12 years of age. Fifteen of these children were between 10 and 12 years of age. The time until the between peak minimum, and the time until the second peak were delayed and more variable in children compared to adults. After a 20-mg dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, concentrations in children were approximately twice the concentrations observed in 18 to 35 year old adults. This higher exposure is almost completely due to the smaller body size and total volume of distribution in children, as apparent clearance normalized to body weight is independent of age.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules has not been studied in renally-impaired patients. Renal impairment is expected to have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate since less than 1% of a radiolabeled dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged compound, and the major metabolite (ritalinic acid), has little or no pharmacologic activity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to have minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate since it is metabolized primarily to ritalinic acid by nonmicrosomal hydrolytic esterases that are widely distributed throughout the body.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas, and in males only, an increase in hepatoblastomas at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 2 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.</p><p>Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 4 times the MRHD (children) on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In a 24-week carcinogenicity study in the transgenic mouse strain p53+/-, which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. Male and female mice were fed diets containing the same concentration of methylphenidate as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study; the high-dose groups were exposed to 60 to 74 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames reverse mutation assay, in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, or in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assay using human lymphocytes. Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased, indicative of a weak clastogenic response, in an in vitro assay in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Methylphenidate was negative <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in males and females in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Methylphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18-week continuous breeding study. The study was conducted at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Children and Adolescents</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical study in which 134 children, ages 6 to 12, with DSM-IV diagnoses of ADHD received a single morning dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in the range of 10 to 40 mg/day, or placebo, for up to 2 weeks. The doses used were the optimal doses established in a previous individual dose titration phase. In that titration phase, 53 of 164 patients (32%) started on a daily dose of 10 mg and 111 of 164 patients (68%) started on a daily dose of 20 mg or higher. The patient’s regular schoolteacher completed the Conners ADHD/DSM-IV Scale for Teachers (CADS-T) at baseline and the end of each week. The CADS-T assesses symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention. The change from baseline of the (CADS-T) scores during the last week of treatment was analyzed as the primary efficacy parameter. Patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules showed a statistically significant improvement in symptom scores from baseline [Mean (final score - baseline) = -10.7 points] over patients who received placebo [Mean (final score - baseline) = +2.8 points]. The lower the final score on the CADS-T scale from baseline, the less severe the disease is. This demonstrates that a single morning dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules exerts a treatment effect in ADHD.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: CADS-T Total Subscale - Mean Change From Baseline*</span></p><p></p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules are supplied as:</p><p><span class="Bold">10 mg:</span></p><p>Hard gelatin capsules, yellow opaque cap printed with “G 10mg” and white opaque body printed with “012” contains white to off-white pellets.</p><p>Bottles of 100 NDC 70010-012-01</p><p><span class="Bold">20 mg:</span></p><p>Hard gelatin capsules, white opaque cap printed with “G 20mg” and white opaque body printed with “013” contains white to off-white pellets.</p><p>Bottles of 100 NDC 70010-013-01</p><p><span class="Bold">30 mg:</span></p><p>Hard gelatin capsules, yellow opaque cap printed with “G 30mg” and yellow opaque body printed with “014” contains white to off-white pellets.</p><p>Bottles of 100 NDC 70010-014-01</p><p><span class="Bold">40 mg:</span></p><p>Hard gelatin capsules, yellow opaque cap printed with “G 40mg” and yellow opaque body printed with “015” contains white to off-white pellets.</p><p>Bottles of 100 NDC 70010-015-01</p><p><span class="Bold">60 mg:</span></p><p>Hard gelatin capsules, yellow opaque cap printed with “G 60mg” and yellow opaque body printed with “016” contains white to off-white pellets.</p><p>Bottles of 30 NDC 70010-016-03</p><p>Store at 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F).
