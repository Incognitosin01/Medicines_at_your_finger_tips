Rash (drug eruption) is one of the most common adverse reactions associated with POTELIGEO. In Trial 1, 25% (80/319) of patients treated with POTELIGEO had an adverse reaction of drug eruption, with 18% of these cases being severe (Grade 3) and 82% of these cases being Grade 1 or 2. Of 528 patients treated with POTELIGEO in clinical trials, Grade 3 skin adverse reactions were reported in 3.6%, Grade 4 skin adverse reactions in &lt;1%, and SJS in &lt;1%.</p><p>The onset of drug eruption is variable, and the affected areas and appearance vary. In Trial 1, the median time to onset was 15 weeks, with 25% of cases occurring after 31 weeks. The more common presentations reported included papular or maculopapular rash, lichenoid, spongiotic or granulomatous dermatitis, and morbilliform rash. Other presentations included scaly plaques, pustular eruption, folliculitis, non-specific dermatitis, and psoriasiform dermatitis.</p><p>Monitor patients for rash throughout the treatment course. Management of dermatologic toxicity includes topical corticosteroids and interruption or permanent cessation of POTELIGEO [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>]. Consider skin biopsy to help distinguish drug eruption from disease progression.</p><p>Discontinue POTELIGEO permanently for SJS or TEN or for any life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction. For possible SJS or TEN, interrupt POTELIGEO and do not restart unless SJS or TEN is ruled out and the cutaneous reaction has resolved to Grade 1 or less.</p><h3>Infusion Reactions</h3><p class="First">Fatal and life-threatening infusion reactions have been reported in patients treated with POTELIGEO. In Trial 1, infusion reactions occurred in 35% (112/319) of patients treated with POTELIGEO, with 8% of these reactions being severe (Grade 3). Most reactions (approximately 90%) occur during or shortly after the first infusion. Infusion reactions can also occur with subsequent infusions. The most commonly reported signs include chills, nausea, fever, tachycardia, rigors, headache, and vomiting.</p><p>Consider premedication (such as diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) for the first infusion of POTELIGEO in all patients. Whether premedication reduces the risk or severity of these reactions is not established. In Trial 1, infusion reactions occurred in 42% of patients without premedication and 32% of patients with premedication. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions and interrupt the infusion for any grade reaction and treat promptly [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><h3>Infections</h3><p class="First">Fatal and life-threatening infections have occurred in patients treated with POTELIGEO, including sepsis, pneumonia, and skin infection. In Trial 1, 18% (34/184) of patients randomized to POTELIGEO had Grade 3 or higher infection or an infection-related serious adverse reaction. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat promptly.</p><h3>Autoimmune Complications</h3><p class="First">Fatal and life-threatening immune-mediated complications have been reported in recipients of POTELIGEO. Grade 3 or higher immune-mediated or possibly immune-mediated reactions have included myositis, myocarditis, polymyositis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Use of systemic immunosuppressants for immune-mediated reactions was reported in 1.9% (6/319) of recipients of POTELIGEO in Trial 1, including for a case of Grade 2 polymyalgia rheumatica. New-onset hypothyroidism (Grade 1 or 2) was reported in 1.3% of patients and managed with observation or levothyroxine. Interrupt or permanently discontinue POTELIGEO as appropriate for suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions. Consider the benefit/risk of POTELIGEO in patients with a history of autoimmune disease.</p><h3>Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) after POTELIGEO</h3><p class="First">Increased risks of transplant complications have been reported in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT after POTELIGEO including severe (Grade 3 or 4) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), steroid-refractory GVHD, and transplant-related death. Among recipients of pre-transplantation POTELIGEO, a higher risk of transplant complications has been reported if POTELIGEO is given within a shorter time frame (approximately 50 days) before HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Trial 1</span></p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to POTELIGEO in a randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trial for adult patients with MF or SS who received at least one prior systemic therapy [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14)</span>]. Of 370 patients treated, 184 (57% with MF, 43% with SS) received POTELIGEO as randomized treatment and 186 (53% with MF, 47% with SS) received vorinostat. In the vorinostat arm, 135 patients (73%) subsequently crossed over to POTELIGEO for a total of 319 patients treated with POTELIGEO.</p><p>POTELIGEO was administered at 1 mg/kg intravenously over at least 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the first 28-day cycle and on days 1 and 15 of subsequent 28-day cycles. Premedication (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen) was optional and administered to 65% of randomized patients for the first infusion. The comparator group received vorinostat 400 mg orally once daily, given continuously in 28-day cycles. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease.</p><p>The median age was 64 years (range, 25 to 101 years), 58% of patients were male, 70% were white, and 99% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had a median of 3 prior systemic therapies. The trial required an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/µL (≥1000/µL if bone marrow was involved), platelet count ≥100,000/µL (≥75,000/µL if bone marrow was involved), creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min or serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL, and hepatic transaminases ≤2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (≤5 times ULN if lymphomatous liver infiltration). Patients with active autoimmune disease, active infection, autologous HSCT within 90 days, or prior allogeneic HSCT were excluded.</p><p>During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to POTELIGEO was 5.6 months, with 48% (89/184) of patients with at least 6 months of exposure and 23% (43/184) with at least 12 months of exposure. The median duration of exposure to vorinostat was 2.8 months, with 22% (41/186) of patients with at least 6 months of exposure.</p><p>Fatal adverse reactions within 90 days of the last dose occurred in 2.2% (7/319) of patients who received POTELIGEO as randomized or crossover treatment.</p><p>Serious adverse reactions were reported in 36% (66/184) of patients randomized to POTELIGEO and most often involved infection (16% of patients; 30/184). Serious adverse reactions reported in &gt;2% of patients randomized to POTELIGEO were pneumonia (5%), sepsis (4%), pyrexia (4%), and skin infection (3%); other serious adverse reactions, each reported in 2% of patients, included hepatitis, pneumonitis, rash, infusion related reaction, lower respiratory tract infection, and renal insufficiency. POTELIGEO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 18% of randomized patients, most often due to rash or drug eruption (7.1%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Common Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients randomized to POTELIGEO) were rash (including drug eruption), infusion related reactions, fatigue, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection and musculoskeletal pain.

Grade 4 treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities observed in ≥1% of the POTELIGEO arm included lymphopenia (5%), leukopenia (1%), and hypophosphatemia (1%).</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to POTELIGEO with the incidences of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p><p>Among 258 patients treated with POTELIGEO in Trial 1, 10 (3.9%) tested positive for treatment-emergent (treatment-induced or treatment-boosted) anti-mogamulizumab-kpkc antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent assay. There were no positive neutralizing antibody responses.</p><h3>Postmarketing Safety Information</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of POTELIGEO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Infections: Hepatitis B virus reactivation</li>
<li>Cardiac disorders: Stress cardiomyopathy</li>
</ul><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on POTELIGEO use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. In an animal reproduction study, administration of mogamulizumab-kpkc to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the start of organogenesis through delivery did not show a potential for adverse developmental outcomes at maternal systemic exposures 27 times the exposure in patients at the recommended dose, based on AUC (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). In general, IgG molecules are known to cross the placental barrier and in the monkey reproduction study mogamulizumab-kpkc was detected in fetal plasma. Therefore, POTELIGEO has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. POTELIGEO is not recommended during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>The effects of mogamulizumab-kpkc on embryo-fetal development were evaluated in 12 pregnant cynomolgus monkeys that received mogamulizumab-kpkc once weekly by intravenous administration from the start of organogenesis through delivery at an exposure level 27 times higher than the clinical dose. Mogamulizumab-kpkc administration did not show a potential for embryo-fetal lethality, teratogenicity, or fetal growth retardation and did not result in spontaneous abortion or increased fetal death. In surviving fetuses (10 of 12 compared with 11 of 12 in the control group) of cynomolgus monkeys treated with mogamulizumab-kpkc, a decrease in CCR4-expressing lymphocytes due to the pharmacological activity of mogamulizumab-kpkc was noted; there were no apparent mogamulizumab-kpkc -related external, visceral, or skeletal abnormalities.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of POTELIGEO in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for POTELIGEO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from POTELIGEO or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">POTELIGEO is not recommended during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span></p><p>For females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating POTELIGEO.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p>Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with POTELIGEO and for at least 3 months following the last dose of POTELIGEO.</p><h3>Pediatric use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of POTELIGEO in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric use</h3><p class="First">Of 319 patients with MF or SS who received POTELIGEO in Trial 1, 162 (51%) were ≥65 years. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. In patients aged ≥65, Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in 45% and serious adverse reactions in 36%, whereas in patients aged &lt;65, Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in 36% and serious adverse reactions in 29%.</p><h2>Poteligeo Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Mogamulizumab-kpkc is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4)-expressing cells. Mogamulizumab-kpkc is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin that has a calculated molecular mass of approximately 149 kDa. Mogamulizumab-kpkc is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells.</p><p>POTELIGEO (mogamulizumab-kpkc) injection is a sterile, ready-to-use, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent colorless solution in a single-dose vial for dilution prior to intravenous infusion. Each vial contains 20 mg of mogamulizumab-kpkc in 5 mL of solution. Each mL of solution contains 4 mg of mogamulizumab-kpkc and is formulated in: citric acid monohydrate (0.44 mg), glycine (22.5 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. May contain hydrochloric acid/sodium hydroxide to adjust pH to 5.5.</p><h2>Poteligeo Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Mogamulizumab-kpkc is a defucosylated, humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to CCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor for CC chemokines that is involved in the trafficking of lymphocytes to various organs. Non-clinical in vitro studies demonstrate mogamulizumab-kpkc binding targets a cell for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) resulting in depletion of the target cells. CCR4 is expressed on the surface of some T-cell malignancies and is expressed on regulatory T-cells (Treg) and a subset of Th2 T-cells.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Mogamulizumab-kpkc exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Mogamulizumab-kpkc pharmacokinetics (PK) was evaluated in patients with T-cell malignancies. Parameters are presented as the geometric mean [% coefficient of variation (%CV)] unless otherwise specified. Mogamulizumab-kpkc concentrations increased proportionally with dose over the dose range of 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg (0.01 to 1 times the approved recommended dosage).</p><p>Following repeated dosing of the approved recommended dosage, steady state concentrations were reached after 8 doses (12 weeks), and the systemic accumulation was 1.6-fold. At steady state, the peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max,ss</span>) is 32 (68%) µg/mL, the trough concentration (C<span class="Sub">min,ss</span>) is 11 (239%) µg/mL, and AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span> is 5577 (125%) µg∙hr/mL.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The central volume of distribution is 3.6 L (20%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>The terminal half-life is 17 days (66%), and the clearance is 12 mL/h (84%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span>:</p><p>No clinically significant changes in the PK of mogamulizumab-kpkc were observed based on age (range: 22 to 101 years), sex, ethnicity, renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;90 mL/min, estimated by Cockcroft-Gault), mild (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &lt;ULN, or total bilirubin &lt;1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) or moderate (total bilirubin &gt;1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment, disease subtype (MF or SS), degree of CCR4 expression, or ECOG status.

The trial randomized 372 patients 1:1 to either POTELIGEO (186 patients; 56% with MF, 44% with SS) or vorinostat (186 patients; 53% with MF, 47% with SS). The trial included patients regardless of tumor CCR4 expression status and excluded patients with histologic transformation, prior allogeneic HSCT, autologous HSCT within 90 days, active autoimmune disease, or active infection. The trial required patients to have ANC ≥1500/µL (≥1000/µL if bone marrow was involved), platelet count ≥100,000/µL (≥75,000/µL if bone marrow was involved), creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min or serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL and hepatic transaminases ≤2.5 times ULN (≤5 times ULN if lymphomatous liver infiltration).</p><p>The dose of POTELIGEO was 1 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of the first 28-day cycle and on days 1 and 15 of each subsequent cycle. Vorinostat was dosed at 400 mg orally once daily, continuously for 28-day cycles. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Vorinostat-treated patients with disease progression or unacceptable toxicities were permitted to cross over to POTELIGEO.</p><p>The median age was 64 years (range: 25 to 101), 58% of patients were male, and 70% were white. At study baseline, 38% had stage IB-II disease, 10% stage III, and 52% stage IV. The median number of prior systemic therapies was 3. In the POTELIGEO arm, baseline CCR4 expression status by immunohistochemistry was available in 140 patients (75%), of whom all had CCR4 detected on ≥1% of lymphocytes on skin biopsy, and 134/140 (96%) had CCR4 detected on ≥10% of the lymphocytes. CCR4 expression status was similar in the vorinostat arm.</p><p>During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to POTELIGEO was 5.6 months (range: &lt;1 to 45.3 months), with 48% of patients with at least 6 months of exposure and 23% with at least 12 months of exposure. The median duration of exposure to vorinostat was 2.8 months (range: &lt;1 to 34.8 months), with 22% of patients with at least 6 months of exposure.</p><p>Efficacy was based on investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), which was defined as the time from the date of randomization until documented progression of disease or death. Other efficacy measures included overall response rate (ORR) based on global composite response criteria that combine measures from each disease compartment (skin, blood, lymph nodes and viscera). Responses required confirmation at two successive disease assessments, which included the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool, skin photographs, central flow cytometry, and computed tomography.</p><p>The trial demonstrated that POTELIGEO significantly prolonged PFS compared to vorinostat (Table 3). The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS by Investigator is shown in Figure 1. The estimated median follow-up for investigator-assessed PFS was 13 months in the POTELIGEO arm and 10.4 months in the vorinostat arm. By independent review committee assessment, the estimated median PFS was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.4) in the POTELIGEO arm and 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.0 to 4.7) in the vorinostat arm (hazard ratio 0.64; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.84).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier Curve for Progression-Free Survival per Investigator</span></p><p>Table 3 also summarizes investigator-assessed confirmed response rates, overall and by disease compartment. The trial demonstrated improvement in ORR with POTELIGEO.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">POTELIGEO (mogamulizumab-kpkc) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent colorless solution supplied in a carton containing one 20 mg/5 mL (4 mg/mL), single-dose glass vial (NDC 42747-761-01).</p><p class="First">Store vials under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in original package to protect from light until time of use.
