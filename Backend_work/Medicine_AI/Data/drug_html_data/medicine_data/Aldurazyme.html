Some people lack this enzyme because of a genetic disorder. Laronidase helps replace this missing enzyme in such people.</p><p>Aldurazyme is used to treat some of the symptoms of a genetic condition called mucopolysaccharidosis or MPS I, also called Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, or Scheie syndrome.</p><p>MPS I is a metabolic disorder in which the body lacks the enzyme needed to break down certain substances. These substances can build up in the body, causing enlarged organs, abnormal bone structure, changes in facial features, breathing problems, heart problems, vision or hearing loss, and changes in mental or physical abilities.</p><p>Aldurazyme may improve breathing and walking ability in people with this condition. However, <b>this medication is not a cure for MPS I.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you receive Aldurazyme, tell your doctor if you have heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease, seizures, migraine headaches, or sleep apnea.</p><p>An allergic reaction may occur during or shortly after infusion of this medicine. <b>Tell your caregivers or get emergency medical help right away if you have any signs of a severe allergic reaction,</b> such as sweating, chest discomfort, trouble breathing, pale skin, blue lips or fingernails, and feeling like you might pass out.</p><p>Your doctor may also prescribe other medications to help prevent an allergic reaction to Aldurazyme. Take all of your medications as directed.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Aldurazyme if you are allergic to laronidase. Your infusion may be delayed if you have a fever or cold symptoms.</p><p>To make sure Aldurazyme is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>breathing problems;</p>

</li>
</ul><p>breathing problems;</p><p>heart disease; or</p><p>sleep apnea, and you use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>It is not known whether laronidase will harm an unborn baby. However, MPS symptoms can get worse during pregnancy and may cause medical problems in both mother and baby. The benefit of treating MPS may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p><b>Your name may need to be listed on an MPS I Registry while you are using this medicine.</b> The purpose of this registry is to track the progression of this disorder and the effects that laronidase has on long-term treatment of MPS I. The registry also tracks the effects of laronidase on a baby if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><h2>How is Aldurazyme given?</h2><p>Aldurazyme is injected into a vein through an IV. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Aldurazyme is usually given once per week.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have been sick with a fever or cold. You may need to wait until you get better before receiving your injection.</p><p>Aldurazyme must be given slowly, and the IV infusion can take up to 4 hours to complete.</p><p>An hour before each injection, you will be given other medications to help prevent a serious allergic reaction.</p><p>After each injection, you will be watched closely for 60 minutes or longer to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction.</p><p>Your doctor will need to check your progress on a regular basis.</p><p>It may take up to several months to years before you get the full benefit of treatment with Aldurazyme. Keep receiving your injections as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I:</b></p><p>0.58 mg/kg IV once a week<br/>
