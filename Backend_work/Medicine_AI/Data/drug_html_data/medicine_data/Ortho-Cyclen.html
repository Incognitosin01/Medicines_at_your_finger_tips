Ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate also causes a change in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.</p><p>Ortho-Cyclen is used as contraception to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>Ortho-Cyclen is also used to treat moderate acne vulgaris in females who are at least 15 old. This medicine should be used for the treatment of acne only if the patient desires an oral contraceptive for birth control.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Ortho-Cyclen if you are pregnant or if you have recently had a baby.</b></p><p><b>You should not use Ortho-Cyclen if you have:</b> uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, coronary artery disease, circulation problems (especially with diabetes), undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease or liver cancer, severe migraine headaches, if you also take certain hepatitis C medication, if you have major surgery, if you smoke and are over 35, or if you have ever had a heart attack, a stroke, a blood clot, jaundice caused by pregnancy or birth control pills, or cancer of the breast, uterus/cervix, or vagina.</p><p>Taking Ortho-Cyclen can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</p><p><b>Smoking can greatly increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.</b> You should not take Ortho-Cyclen if you smoke and are over 35 years old.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Taking Ortho-Cyclen can increase your risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.
