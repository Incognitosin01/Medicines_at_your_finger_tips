Your child's lung function will be tested often.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Your child should not be treated with this medicine if the child is allergic to Virazole (such as Rebetol, RibaPak, Ribasphere, RibaTab).</p><p>This medicine is for use only in young children, but Virazole can harm an unborn baby or cause birth defects.</p><p>Virazole should not be used by <b>a woman</b> who is pregnant or may become pregnant, or <b>a man</b> whose sex partner is pregnant.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is  Virazole given?</h2><p>A healthcare provider will give your baby  Virazole in a hospital.</p><p>Virazole is given with a machine that releases the medicine as an aerosol into an oxygen hood or tent, or a face mask. This allows your child to gently inhale the medicine over a long period of time.</p><p>Virazole is usually given for 12 to 18 hours per day for 3 to 7 days.</p><p>Small amounts of ribavirin may be released into the nearby air while this medicine is being given to your child. Anyone in close contact with the child may be exposed to Virazole released into the air.</p><p>Your child's lung function will be tested often. The doctor may prescribe bronchodilator medication to help improve your child's breathing.</p><p>You may need to follow special precautions to avoid exposure to airborne Virazole while your baby is being treated with this medicine. Carefully follow all directions about handling or being near your child.</p><p>Women who are able to become pregnant should avoid close contact with the child. Otherwise, take all safety precautions needed to reduce your exposure to Virazole.</p><p>Being near a child who has RSV may increase your risk of becoming infected with the virus. Seek medical attention if you have symptoms such as headache, stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, fever, hoarseness, and wheezing.</p><p>Virazole is for use only in babies and young children and should not be used by an adult.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because your child will receive  Virazole in a clinical setting, a missed dose is not likely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  Virazole is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving  Virazole?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions you should follow while caring for a child being treated with this medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Virazole side effects</h2><p><b>Get emergency medical help if your baby has signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Your baby will remain under constant supervision during treatment with Virazole. Any problems the baby has during this time may require further treatment by healthcare professionals.</p><p><b>Sudden breathing problems may occur.</b> Tell your baby's caregivers at once if the baby has any of these side effects:</p><ul>
