Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack.</p><p>Torsemide may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use  torsemide if you are allergic to sulfa drugs or if you are unable to urinate.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use torsemide if you are allergic to it, or if:</p><ul>

The benefit of treating hypertension may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p>Torsemide is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take torsemide?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Torsemide oral is taken by mouth.</p><p>Torsemide injection is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself. Torsemide injection is given either as a slow infusion over 2 minutes, or as a continuous (around the clock) infusion.</p><p>If you have cirrhosis or other liver problems, you may receive your first <b>injection</b> in a hospital or clinic setting to quickly treat any serious side effects.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>You may take torsemide with or without food.</p><p>Your blood pressure will need to be checked often, and you may need other medical tests. Your blood and urine may both be tested if you have been vomiting or are dehydrated.</p><p>Some things can cause your blood pressure to get too low. This includes vomiting, diarrhea, or heavy sweating. Call your doctor if you are sick with vomiting or diarrhea.</p><p>Your condition may be treated with a combination of drugs. Use all medications as directed by your doctor. Do not change your doses or medication schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p>If you have high blood pressure, keep taking torsemide oral even if you feel well.
