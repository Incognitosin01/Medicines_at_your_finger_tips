</ul><h2>CAUTION</h2><p class="First">Federal (USA) law prohibits dispensing without prescription</p><h2>Megatope Description</h2><p class="First">Megatope (Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection) is a diagonostic radiopharmaceutical<br/>
containing iodinated I 131 albumin for intravenous use. Each mL of sterile, nonpyro-<br/>
genic, aqueous, colorless to very pale yellow solution provides approximate 10 mg<br/>
protein (albumin human), 16 mg dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.6 mg monobasic<br/>
sodium phosphate, not more than 0.4 guanidine hydrochloride, sodium chloride<br/>
for isotonicity, and 9 mg benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The pH has been adjusted<br/>
to 7.2 to 7.8 with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.<br/>
Megatope was prepared from blood that was nonreactive when tested for hepatitis<br/>
B surface antigen (HBsAg).<br/>
The structure of the complex is unknown.</p><h2>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h2><p class="First">Iodine 131 decays by beta and gamma emissions with a physical half-life of 8.08 days.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>Photons that are useful for detection and imaging studies are listed in Table 1.</p><p></p><p><span class="Bold">External Radiation</span></p><p>The specific gamma ray constant for iodine 131 is 2.2 R/hour-millicurie at 1 cm. The </p><p>first half-value layer is 0.24 cm lead (Pb). A range of values for the relative attenuation</p><p>of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that result from interposition of various</p><p>thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2. To facilitate control of the radiation exposure</p><p>from this radionuclide, the use of a 2.55 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation</p><p>emitted by a factor of about 1,000.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Megatope - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Following intravenous injection, radioiodinated albumin human is uniformly</p><p>distributed throughout the intravascular pool within 10 minutes; extravascular</p><p>distribution takes place more slowly. Iodinated I 131 albumin can also be detected in</p><p>the lymph and in certain body tissues within 10 minutes after injection but maximum </p><p>distribution of radioactivity throughout the extravascular space does not occur until</p><p>two to four days after administration.  The time at which extravascular activity is </p><p>maximal has been designated as the "equilibrium time". When this point has been</p><p>reached, the radioactivity remaining in the intravascular and extravascular spaces</p><p>decreases slowly and exponentially in parallel fashion.</p><p>    The administered radioactivity is eliminated almost entirely in the urine, only about</p><p>2 percent of the total dose ultimately appearing in the feces.</p><p>    The biologic half-life of Iodinated I 131 albumin is dependent upon a number of </p><p>factors, and published studies have varied considerably in their reporting of this </p><p>figure. It has ranged, in the literature, from below 10 days to over 20 days. One</p><p>important factor affecting the biological half-life is the initial rate of excretion, and this</p><p>depends in part on the quality of the Iodinated I 131 albumin. With Megatope, the </p><p>biologic half-life in normal individuals has been reported to be approximately 14 days.`</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Megatope</h2><p class="First">Megatope (Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection) is indicated for use in determinations of </p><p>total blood and plasma volumes, cardiac output, cardiac and pulmonary blood</p><p>volumes and circulation times, and in protein turnover studies, heart and great vessel</p><p>dilineation, localization of the placenta, and localization of celebral neospasms.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None Known.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">A few instances of hyperpyrexia and aseptic (chemical) meningeal irritation have </p><p>been reported with the use of iodinated I 131 in cisternography. Iodinated I</p><p>131 Albumin injection is <span class="Bold">not approved</span> for use in cisternography.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>In the use of any radioactive material, care should be taken to insure minimum </p><p>radiation exposure to the patient and occupational workers consistent with proper</p><p>patient management. </p><p>    Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by </p><p>training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose </p><p>experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency</p><p>authorized to license the use of radionuclides.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis,</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential </p><p>or whether iodinate I 131 albumin affects fertility in males and females.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Iodinated I 131 Albumin</p><p>Injection. It is also not known whether this agent can cause fetal harm when adminis-</p><p>tered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Iodinated I 131</p><p>Albumin injection should be administered to a pregnant woman only if clearly</p><p>needed.</p><p>   Ideally, examinations using radiopharmaceuticals, especially those elective in </p><p>nature, of a woman of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few</p><p>(approximately 10) days following the onset of menses.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>Since iodine 131 is excreted in human milk during lactation, formula feedings should </p><p>be substituted for breast feedings.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p><p>Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">Although the immunological properties of albumin human are believed to be virtually </p><p>unaltered by the iodination process, there is a theoretical possibility that allergic</p><p>reactions may occur in patients receiving additional doses a number of weeks after an </p><p>initial dose.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Megatope  (Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection) is administered intravenously.</span> Parenteral </p><p>drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and abnormal </p><p>coloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p><p>Megatope (Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection) may be colorless to very pale yellow. </p><p>Solutions with excessive colorations should not be used.</p><p>    When a procedure such as blood volume or a circulation time determination is to </p><p>be repeated, the total dosage administered in any one week should not exceed 200</p><p>microcuries.</p><p>    To minimize the uptake of radioactive Iodine by the thyroid, prior administration of </p><p>Lugol's Solution (Strong Iodine Solution USP) may be used. Ten drops of Lugol's </p><p>Solution three times daily, beginning at least 24 hours before administration of </p><p>Megatope and continuing for one or two weeks thereafter, is a suitable dose.</p><p>     Complete assay data for each vial are provided on the container.</p><p><span class="Bold">     Note: </span>The expiration date given on the container pertains to the biologic properties</p><p>of the material and not to the radioactivity level. It is important to make certain that the </p><p>radioactivity in the dose at the time of administration is sufficient for the intended use.</p><p>    The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system</p><p>immediately prior to administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">   Note:</span> A shielded syringe should be used for withdrawing and injecting the iodinated </p><p>I 131 albumin</p><p><span class="Bold">Total Blood and Plasma Volumes</span></p><p>Dosage may range from 5 to 50 microcuries.</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood Volume Determination</span></p><p><span class="Bold">A. Preparation of Reference Solution</span></p><p>Remove an aliquot of the contents of the vial to be used in the procedure identical in</p><p>volume to the dose to be administered to the patient. Prepare a reference solution</p><p>using normal saline as a diluent. The recommended dilution is 1:4000 [Dilution Factor</p><p>(DF) = 4000]. Determine the radioactivity concentration (net cpm/ml) of the</p><p>reference solution. Care must be taken to assure that the reference solution and the</p><p>blood samples (Step B3) are assayed using the same geometric configuration.</p><p><span class="Bold">A. Administration of Dose</span></p><p>1. Inject the dose into a large vein in patient's arm. Measure the residual radioactivity</p><p>    in the syringe and needle.</p><p>2. Destroy the syringe after injecting. Do not attempt to resterilize.CAUTION: The</p><p>    syringe should be disposed of in accordance with the US Nuclear Regulatory</p><p>    Commission or Agreement State regulations pertaining to the disposal of</p><p>    radioactive waste.</p><p>3. At 5 and 15 minutes after injecting the dose, withdraw blood samples <span class="Bold">from the</span></p><p><span class="Bold">    patient's other arm</span> with a sterile heparinized syringe.</p><p><span class="Bold">B. Calculation of Blood Volume</span></p><p>1. Take a known aliquot from each blood sample and determine radioconcentration</p><p>    in net cpm/mL.</p><p>2. Plot the 5- and 15-minute sample counts (net cpm/mL) on semilog graph paper</p><p>    using the average count value of each sample and determine the</p><p>    radioconcentration at injection time (zero time) by drawing a straight line through</p><p>    the 15- and 5- minute points to zero time. The x ordinate iof the graph is the sample</p><p>    withdrawal time and the logarithmic y ordinate is radioconcentration in</p><p>    net cpm/mL.</p><p>3. Calculate the patient's blood volume (in mL) using the following formula:</p><p><span class="Bold">      Net cpm/mL reference solution        </span>       ×    DF = blood volume (in mL)</p><p>   Net cpm/mL patient's blood sample</p><p><span class="Bold">Sample Blood Volume Calculations</span></p><p>Volume of blood sample aliquot                                = 1.0 mL</p><p>Volume of reference solution aliquot                         = 1.0 mL</p><p>Net counts at zero time                                         = 48,100</p><p>Net counts obtained from reference solution aliquot    = 52,430</p><p>Using the formula above gives <span class="Bold">52,430</span> x 4000 = 4360 mL<br/>

It must be remembered that</p><p>it is always necessary to correct for background radioactivity remaining in the blood</p><p>from former determinations. Therefore, for each determination after the first one, a</p><p>background blood sample must be taken just <span class="Bold">before</span> the iodinated I 131 albumin is</p><p>injected.</p><p><span class="Bold">Background Blood Sample:</span></p><p>1. Withdraw background blood sample from large vein in patient's arm with a sterile</p><p>    heparinized syringe.</p><p>2. Leaving needle in patient's vein, detach syringe containing blood sample.</p><p>3. Attach syringe containing the dose of Megatope to the indwelling needle and</p><p>    administer (see instructions under <span class="Bold">Blood Volume Determination, Administration of</span></p><p><span class="Bold">    Dose</span>).</p><p>4. Determine radioconcentration in net cpm/mL of aliquots taken from background</p><p>    and postinjection blood samples, and from the reference solution.</p><p>   The radioconcentration (net cpm/mL) per aliquot of the <span class="Bold">background</span> blood sample</p><p>must be subtracted from the radioconcentration per aliquot of the blood sample</p><p>obtained <span class="Bold">after</span> the injection of Iodinated I 131 albumin. The formula for calculating</p><p>each blood volume determination after the first one thus becomes:</p><p><span class="Bold">     Net cpm/mL reference solution          </span> ×  DF    =        blood<br/>

The formula for calculation of</p><p>plasma volume, therefore is:</p><p><span class="Bold">     Net cpm/mL reference solution       </span>         ×     DF    =   plasma volume<br/>

While fetal thyroid irradiation is higher with Iodinated I 131 Albumin</p><p>Injection than with x-ray placentography, the administration of Lugol's Solution is</p><p>reported to eliminate this hazard.</p><p><span class="Bold">Localization of Celebral Neospasms</span></p><p>The suggested dosage is 5 microcuries per kg of body weight. Although doses as</p><p>large as 500 microcuries of Iodinated I 131 Albumin Injection have been used, the</p><p>dose should be kept as small as possible.
