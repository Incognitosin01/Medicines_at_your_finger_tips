The compound has two dissociation constants (pKa's): 5.95 and 9.01.</p><p>ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension is a malt flavored antibiotic suspension containing 30 mg/mL of orbifloxacin and sorbic acid as a preservative.</p><p></p><p class="MultiMediaCaptionNotCentered">FIGURE 1. Chemical structure of orbifloxacin</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension is indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections (cystitis) in dogs caused by susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli</span> and <span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecalis</span>. ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension is also indicated for skin and soft tissue infections (wounds and abscesses) in dogs caused by susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus aureus</span>, coagulase positive staphylococci, <span class="Italics">Pasteurella multocida, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas</span> spp., <span class="Italics">Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter</span> spp., <span class="Italics">Citrobacter</span> spp., <span class="Italics">Enterococcus faecalis</span>, β-hemolytic streptococci (Group G) and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus equisimilis</span>.</p><h2>Orbax Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Shake Well Before Use.</span> BEFORE INITIAL USE, remove the cap and insert the syringe adaptor by pressing firmly into top of bottle. Insert the syringe tip into the adaptor opening and invert the bottle. Withdraw the required amount of medication with the calibrated syringe. After use, replace cap, leaving adaptor in the bottle, and rinse the syringe with water.</p><p>The dose of ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension in the dog is 1.1 to 3.4 mg/lb (2.5 to 7.5 mg/kg) of body weight administered once daily (See Drug interactions and Animal Safety). The determination of dosage for any particular patient must take into consideration such factors as the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative organism, and the integrity of the patient's host-defense mechanisms. Antibiotic susceptibility of the pathogenic organism(s) should be determined prior to use of this preparation. Therapy with ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension may be initiated before results of these tests are known. Once results become available, continue with appropriate therapy.</p><p>For the treatment of skin infections, ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension should be given for two (2) to three (3) days beyond the cessation of clinical signs to a maximum of 30 days. For the treatment of urinary tract infections, ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension should be administered for at least 10 consecutive days. If no improvement is seen within five (5) days, the diagnosis should be re-evaluated and a different course of therapy considered.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Orbifloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested, the dog being particularly sensitive to this side effect. Orbifloxacin is contraindicated in immature dogs during the rapid growth phase (between 2 and 8 months of age in small and medium-sized breeds, and up to 18 months of age in large and giant breeds).</p><p>Orbifloxacin is contraindicated in dogs known to be hypersensitive to quinolones.</p><h2>HUMAN WARNING</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For use in animals only. Keep out of the reach of children.</span></p><p>Individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to quinolones should avoid this product. In humans, there is a risk of user photosensitization within a few hours after excessive exposure to quinolones. If excessive accidental exposure occurs, avoid direct sunlight.</p><p>Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with copious amounts of water for 15 minutes. In case of dermal contact, wash skin with soap and water. Consult a physician if irritation persists following ocular or dermal exposure.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Prescribing antibacterial drugs in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to treated animals and may increase the risk of the development of drug-resistant animal pathogens.</p><p>Administer orbifloxacin with caution in the presence of hepatic insufficiency/impairment. Please refer to the cat side of this package insert for Precautions related specifically to cats. Quinolones should be used with caution in animals with known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In such animals, quinolones have, in rare instances, been associated with CNS stimulation, which may lead to convulsive seizures. Quinolones have been shown to produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. The safety of orbifloxacin in animals that are used for breeding or that are pregnant and/or lactating has not been demonstrated.</p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First">Compounds (eg, sucralfate, antacids, and multivitamins) containing divalent and trivalent cations (eg, iron, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and zinc) may substantially interfere with the absorption of quinolones resulting in a decrease in product bioavailability. Therefore, the concomitant oral administration of quinolones with foods, supplements, or other preparations containing these compounds should be avoided.</p><p>The dosage of theophylline should be reduced when used concurrently with fluoroquinolones. Cimetidine has been shown to interfere with the metabolism of fluoroquinolones and should be used with care when used concurrently. Concurrent use of fluoroquinolones with oral cyclosporine is contraindicated. Concurrent administration of fluoroquinolones may increase the action of oral anticoagulants.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In a field study, when the tablet formulation of orbifloxacin was administered at 2.5 mg/kg/day, no drug-related adverse reactions were reported. In a foreign field study using the oral suspension at 7.5 mg/kg/day, vomiting was reported for ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension and the comparator.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post Approval Experience with ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> (orbifloxacin) Tablets (Rev. 2010): <span class="Italics">The following adverse events are based on post-approval adverse drug experience reporting with ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> (orbifloxacin) Tablets. Not all adverse reactions are reported to FDA CVM. It is not always possible to reliably estimate the adverse event frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure using this data. The following adverse events are listed in decreasing order of reporting frequency:</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">DOG:</span> Vomiting, convulsions, depression/lethargy, anorexia</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">For a complete listing of adverse reactions for ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> (orbifloxacin) Tablets reported to the CVM see:</span></p><p>http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm055394.htm</p><p>For technical assistance or to report a suspected adverse reaction call 1-800-224-5318.</p><h2>Orbax Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Pharmacokinetics in healthy, adult Beagle dogs</h3><p class="First">In fasted animals, orbifloxacin is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. The absolute bioavailability (F) of an oral dose is approximately 100%. The effects of concomitant feeding on the absorption of orbifloxacin have not been studied in the dog. Divalent cations are generally known to diminish the absorption of fluoroquinolones. (See <span class="Bold">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span>.)</p><p>Distribution in the Body: Orbifloxacin penetrates into most tissues and body fluids following oral dosing. A summary of the body fluid and tissue drug levels at 3 and 6 hours following dose administration is presented in Table 1. Particularly high levels of orbifloxacin are found in the prostate, kidneys, liver, bile, lungs, lymph nodes, small intestine, cartilage, muscle, salivary gland and testes.</p><p>In a pharmacokinetic study conducted with ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> (orbifloxacin) Tablets, within 24 hours of administration, approximately 40% of an oral dose was excreted into the urine unchanged in dogs with normal renal function (n=12). This supports the effectiveness of orbifloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Based on the plasma elimination half-life and the dosing interval, negligible drug accumulation is expected with multiple dosing.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated in a randomized two-period, two-sequence crossover study using single intravenous and oral doses are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 2.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Plasma Concentration of Orbifloxacin (Tablet Formulation) vs. Time in Dogs</span></p><p></p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated in a randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover biocomparability study between the orally administered ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> (orbifloxacin) Tablets and ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension are summarized in Table 4 and Figure 3. Results of this study demonstrate that ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension is bioequivalent to ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> (orbifloxacin) Tablets.</p><p><span class="Bold">FIGURE 3: Mean plasma concentration of orbifloxacin (tablets and oral suspension) vs. time in dogs (7.5 mg/kg)</span></p><p></p><h3>MICROBIOLOGY</h3><p class="First">Orbifloxacin is bactericidal against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms and exerts its antibacterial effect through interference with the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase which is needed for the maintenance and synthesis of bacterial DNA. The time-kill kinetics of orbifloxacin against <span class="Italics">Staphylococcus</span> spp. has been described by Ganiere et al., 2004<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><p>The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pathogens isolated in multicentered clinical field studies performed with the oral tablet formulation in the United States were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines<span class="Sup">2</span>, and are in Tables 7 and 8.</p><h3>EFFECTIVENESS</h3><p class="First">Clinical effectiveness for ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> (orbifloxacin) Tablets (NADA 141-081) was established for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (wounds and abscesses) and urinary tract infections (cystitis) in dogs. Specific bacterial pathogens isolated in the clinical field study are listed in the <span class="Bold">MICROBIOLOGY</span> section.</p><p>Effectiveness of the oral suspension in dogs was established in a biocomparability study demonstrating that ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension is bioequivalent to ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> (orbifloxacin) Tablets.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY</h2><p class="First">No mortality occurred when ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension was administered to young, clinically healthy, adult Beagles at doses of 7.5 mg/kg, 22.5 mg/kg, and 37.5 mg/kg once daily for 30 consecutive days, and at 75 mg/kg/day once daily for 10 consecutive days. Body temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate were not affected by orbifloxacin treatment. Discoloration of the feces (white to yellow) was observed at all dose levels. At 37.5 and 75 mg/kg/day, ORBAX<span class="Sup">®</span> Oral Suspension caused gastrointestinal signs, including emesis and soft and/or mucoid feces. At doses of 75 mg/kg/day, hypersalivation was observed. Male dogs treated with 75 mg/kg/day had reduced food consumption and mild weight loss. Glucosuria and lower urine pH were also observed in 7 out of 10 dogs treated with orbifloxacin at 75 mg/kg/day. No other changes in clinical chemistry related to these changes in the urinalysis were observed. The mechanism responsible for the glucosuria and lower pH in this group could not be determined. Following 10 days of treatment with 75 mg/kg/day, one male dog developed hepatic perilobular necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia and inflammation associated with serum elevations in bilirubin and hepatic enzymes (ALK, ALT, AST, GGT). The dog completed the study without clinical signs of illness. At necropsy, the liver had a tan discoloration and weighed significantly less than the livers from other dogs in the group and control dogs. No treatment-related pathologic liver changes were noted in any other dogs treated with orbifloxacin during the study. Articular cartilage defects in the head of the humerus in one male dog in the 3X dose group, and in the medial condyle of the distal femur in one male dog in the 5X dose group were observed. Based on microscopic examination of these lesions it was determined that both lesions were long standing and were present prior to treatment with orbifloxacin.

A mild decrease in food consumption was noted in females that received 45 mg/kg/day and in both sexes that received 75 mg/kg/day.</p><p>One cat in the 75 mg/kg/day group had a transient increase in AST (56U/L: normal 14-30) and ALT (642 U/L: normal 42-86) on Day 21 which returned to normal levels by study completion. Additionally at 75 mg/kg/day a decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase was observed in 4 of the 8 cats. Decreased serum albumin was noted in a cat that received 45 mg/kg/day and one cat that received 75 mg/kg/day, with a secondary decrease in serum calcium noted in one cat that received 75 mg/kg/day.

Ophthalmologic examinations of multiple cats that received 45 and 75 mg/kg/day revealed tapetal hyperreflectivity, which correlated histopathologically with minimal photoreceptor swelling. Electron microscopy revealed swollen rod cells with disorganized disc material in the outer photoreceptor segments. The ophthalmologic examinations on study Days 24 and 31 revealed test article-related hyperreflectivity (retinal degeneration) in some cats at both 45 and 75 mg/kg/day, although electroretinographic responses at the same time intervals did not indicate any changes in retinal function. Minimal photoreceptor degeneration was noted microscopically in all cats at 45 and 75 mg/kg/day.
