</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Fenofibrate Capsules</h2><h3>Primary Hypercholesterolemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia</h3><p class="First">Fenofibrate Capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), Triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.</p><h3>Severe Hypertriglyceridemia</h3><p class="First">Fenofibrate Capsules are also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually reduce fasting triglycerides and eliminate chylomicronemia thereby obviating the need for pharmacologic intervention.</p><p>Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. &gt; 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibrate therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.</p><h3>Important Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> <span class="Italics">(5.1)</span>].</p><h2>Fenofibrate Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Considerations</h3><p class="First">Patients should be placed on an appropriate lipid-lowering diet before receiving fenofibrate capsule, and should continue this diet during treatment with fenofibrate capsule. Fenofibrate Capsules can be given without regard to meals.</p><p>Patients should be advised to swallow Fenofibrate Capsules whole. Do not open, crush, dissolve or chew capsules.</p><p>The initial treatment for dyslipidemia is dietary therapy specific for the type of lipoprotein abnormality. Excess body weight and excess alcoholic intake may be important factors in hypertriglyceridemia and should be addressed prior to any drug therapy. Physical exercise can be an important ancillary measure. Diseases contributory to hyperlipidemia, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus should be looked for and adequately treated. Estrogen therapy, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, are sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia. In such cases, discontinuation of the specific etiologic agent may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of hypertriglyceridemia<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Lipid levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of Fenofibrate Capsules if lipid levels fall significantly below the targeted range.</p><p>Therapy should be withdrawn in patients who do not have an adequate response after two months of treatment with the maximum recommended dose of 90 mg once daily.</p><h3>Primary Hypercholesterolemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia</h3><p class="First">The initial dose of fenofibrate capsule is 90 mg per day.</p><h3>Severe Hypertriglyceridemia</h3><p class="First">The initial dose is 30 to 90 mg per day. Dosage should be individualized according to patient response, and should be adjusted if necessary following repeat lipid determinations at 4 to 8 week intervals. The maximum dose is 90 mg per day.</p><h3>Impaired Renal Function</h3><p class="First">Treatment with Fenofibrate Capsules should be initiated at a dose of 30 mg per day in patients having mild to moderately impaired renal function, and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. The use of Fenofibrate Capsules should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment [see <span class="Italics">Use In Specific Populations (8.6)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Geriatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity</h3><p class="First">The effects of Fenofibrate Capsules on coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and non-cardiovascular mortality have not been established.</p><p>The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Lipid (ACCORD Lipid) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled study of 5518 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on background statin therapy treated with fenofibrate. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.7 years. Fenofibrate plus statin combination therapy showed a nonsignificant 8% relative risk reduction in the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular disease death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.79- 1.08) (p=0.32) as compared to statin monotherapy. In a gender subgroup analysis, the hazard ratio for MACE in men receiving combination therapy versus statin monotherapy was 0.82 (95% CI 0.69-0.99), and the hazard ratio for MACE in women receiving combination therapy versus statin monotherapy was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98-1.94) (interaction p=0.01). The clinical significance of this subgroup finding is unclear.</p><p>The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study was a 5-year randomized, placebo-controlled study of 9795 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with fenofibrate. Fenofibrate demonstrated a non-significant 11% relative reduction in the primary outcome of coronary heart disease events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.05, p=0.16) and a significant 11% reduction in the secondary outcome of total cardiovascular disease events (HR 0.89 [0.80-0.99], p=0.04). There was a non-significant 11% (HR 1.11 [0.95, 1.29], p=0.18) and 19% (HR 1.19 [0.90, 1.57], p=0.22) increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, with fenofibrate as compared to placebo.</p><p>Because of chemical, pharmacological, and clinical similarities between TRICOR (fenofibrate tablets), clofibrate, and gemfibrozil, the adverse findings in 4 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies with these other fibrate drugs may also apply to Fenofibrate Capsules.</p><p>In the Coronary Drug Project, a large study of post myocardial infarction of patients treated for 5 years with clofibrate, there was no difference in mortality seen between the clofibrate group and the placebo group. There was however, a difference in the rate of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis requiring surgery between the two groups (3.0% vs. 1.8%).</p><p>In a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), 5000 subjects without known coronary artery disease were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional one year. There was a statistically significant, higher age-adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.70% vs. 3.96%, pâ‰¤0.01). Excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and pancreatitis. This appeared to confirm the higher risk of gallbladder disease seen in clofibrate-treated patients studied in the Coronary Drug Project.</p><p>The Helsinki Heart Study was a large (n=4081) study of middle-aged men without a history of coronary artery disease. Subjects received either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5 year open extension afterward. Total mortality was numerically higher in the gemfibrozil randomization group but did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.19, 95% confidence interval for relative risk G:P=0.91-1.64). Although cancer deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group (p=0.11), cancers (excluding basal cell carcinoma) were diagnosed with equal frequency in both study groups. Due to the limited size of the study, the relative risk of death from any cause was not shown to be different than that seen in the 9 year follow-up data from the WHO study (RR=1.29).</p><p>A secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study enrolled middle-aged men excluded from the primary prevention study because of known or suspected coronary heart disease. Subjects received gemfibrozil or placebo for 5 years. Although cardiac deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group, this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.94-5.05).</p><h3>Skeletal Muscle</h3><p class="First">Fibrates increase the risk for myopathy, and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal failure, or hypothyroidism.</p><p>Data from observational studies suggest that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates, in particularly gemfibrozil, are co-administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). The combination should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.</p><p>Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and Fenofibrate Capsules therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy/myositis is suspected or diagnosed.</p><p>Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.4)</span>]</p><h3>Liver Function</h3><p class="First">Fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 90 mg Fenofibrate Capsules per day has been associated with increases in serum transaminases [AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT)].</p><p>In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 5.3% of patients taking fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo. When transaminase determinations were followed either after discontinuation of treatment or during continued treatment, a return to normal limits was usually observed. The incidence of increases in transaminases levels related to fenofibrate therapy appears to be dose related.</p><p>Hepatocellular, chronic active and cholestatic hepatitis associated with fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years. In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in association with chronic active hepatitis.</p><p>Baseline and regular periodic monitoring of liver function, including serum ALT (SGPT) should be performed for the duration of therapy with Fenofibrate Capsules, and therapy discontinued if enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit.</p><h3>Serum Creatinine</h3><p class="First">Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment taking Fenofibrate Capsules. Renal monitoring should also be considered for patients taking Fenofibrate Capsules at risk for renal insufficiency such as the elderly and patients with diabetes.</p><h3>Cholelithiasis</h3><p class="First">Fenofibrate, like clofibrate and gemfibrozil, may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Fenofibrate Capsules therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found.</p><h3>Coumarin Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with Fenofibrate Capsules because of the potentiation of coumarin-type anti-coagulants in prolonging the prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR). To prevent bleeding complications, frequent monitoring of PT/INR and dose adjustment of the anticoagulant are recommended until PT/INR has stabilized [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>].</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Pancreatitis has been reported in patients taking fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and clofibrate. This occurrence may represent a failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct.</p><h3>Hematologic Changes</h3><p class="First">Mild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following initiation of fenofibrate therapy. However, these levels stabilize during long-term administration. Thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported in individuals treated with fenofibrate. Periodic monitoring of red and white blood cell counts are recommended during the first 12 months of Fenofibrate Capsules administration.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Acute Hypersensitivity</span></span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported postmarketing with fenofibrate. In some cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of an acute hypersensitivity reaction, advise them to seek immediate medical attention and discontinue fenofibrate.</span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Delayed Hypersensitivity</span></span></p><p> <span class="following_xmChange">Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCAR), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), have been reported postmarketing, occurring days to weeks after initiation of fenofibrate. The cases of DRESS were associated with cutaneous reactions (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis) and a combination of eosinophilia, fever, systemic organ involvement (renal, hepatic, or respiratory). Discontinue fenofibrate and treat patients appropriately if SCAR is suspected.</span></p><h3>Venothromboembolic Disease</h3><p class="First">In the FIELD trial, pulmonary embolus (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were observed at higher rates in the fenofibrate than the placebo-treated group. Of 9795 patients enrolled in FIELD, there were 4900 in the placebo group and 4895 in the fenofibrate group. For DVT, there were 48 events (1%) in the placebo group and 67 (1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.074); and for PE, there were 32 (0.7%) events in the placebo group and 53 (1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.022).</p><p>In the Coronary Drug Project, a higher proportion of the clofibrate group experienced definite or suspected fatal or nonfatal pulmonary embolism or thrombophlebitis than the placebo group (5.2% vs. 3.3% at five years; p &lt; 0.01).</p><h3>Paradoxical Decreases in HDL Cholesterol Levels</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing and clinical trial reports of severe decreases in HDL cholesterol levels (as low as 2 mg/dL) occurring in diabetic and non-diabetic patients initiated on fibrate therapy. The decrease in HDL-C is mirrored by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1. This decrease has been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy. The HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is rapid and sustained. The clinical significance of this decrease in HDL-C is unknown. It is recommended that HDL-C levels be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy. If a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn, and the HDL-C level monitored until it has returned to baseline, and fibrate therapy should not be re-initiated.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>Adverse events reported by 2% or more of patients treated with fenofibrate and greater than placebo during double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, regardless of causality, are listed in Table 1. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5.0% of patients treated with fenofibrate and in 3.0% treated with placebo. Increases in liver function tests were the most frequent events, causing discontinuation of fenofibrate treatment in 1.6% of patients in double-blind trials.</p><p>Urticaria was seen in 1.1 vs. 0%, and rash in 1.4 vs. 0.8% of fenofibrate and placebo patients, respectively, in controlled trials.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of fenofibrate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, renal failure, muscle spasms, acute renal failure, hepatitis, cirrhosis, anemia, arthralgia, asthenia, severely depressed HDL-cholesterol levels, and interstitial lung disease. Photosensitivity reactions have occurred days to months after initiation; in some of these cases, patients reported a prior photosensitivity reaction to ketoprofen.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Coumarin Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effects has been observed with prolongation of the PT/INR.</p><p>Caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with Fenofibrate Capsules. The dosage of the anticoagulants should be reduced to maintain the PT/INR at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications. Frequent PT/INR determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the PT/INR has stabilized [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>].</p><h3>Immunosuppressants</h3><p class="First">Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus can produce nephrotoxicity with decrease in creatinine clearance and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including Fenofibrate Capsules, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration of renal function. The benefits and risks of using Fenofibrate Capsules with immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed.</p><h3>Bile-Acid Binding Resins</h3><p class="First">Since bile acid binding resins may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take Fenofibrate Capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding its absorption.</p><h3>Colchicine</h3><p class="First">Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C</span></span></p><p>Safety in pregnant women has not been established. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of fenofibrate in pregnant women. Fenofibrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>In female rats given oral dietary doses of 15, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day of fenofibrate from 15 days prior to mating through weaning, maternal toxicity was observed at 0.3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p>In pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 14, 127, and 361 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6-15 during the period of organogenesis, adverse developmental findings were not observed at 14 mg/kg/day (less than 1 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). At higher multiples of human doses, evidence of maternal toxicity was observed.</p><p>In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 15, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 6 to 18 during the period of organogenesis and allowed to deliver, aborted litters were observed at 150 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons: mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). No developmental findings were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (at less than 1 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><p>In pregnant rats given oral dietary doses of 15, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15 through lactation day 21 (weaning), maternal toxicity was observed at less than 1 times the MRHD, based on body surface area comparisons; mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Fenofibrate should not be used in nursing mothers. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Fenofibric acid is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Fenofibric acid exposure is not influenced by age. Since elderly patients have a higher incidence of renal impairment, dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.5)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Elderly patients with normal renal function should require no dose modifications. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients taking Fenofibrate Capsules.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Fenofibrate should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>]. Dose reduction is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The use of Fenofibrate Capsules has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment [see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no specific treatment for overdose with Fenofibrate Capsules. General supportive care of the patient is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status, should an overdose occur. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. Because fenofibrate is highly bound to plasma proteins, hemodialysis should not be considered.</p><h2>Fenofibrate Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Fenofibrate Capsule is a lipid regulating agent available as capsules for oral administration. Each capsule contains 30 mg or 90 mg of micronized fenofibrate. The chemical name for fenofibrate is 2-[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl) phenoxy] 2-methyl-propanoic acid, l-methylethyl ester with the following structural formula:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Fenofibrate</p><p>The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">20</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span>Cl and the molecular weight is 360.83; fenofibrate is insoluble in water. The melting point is 79Â°-82Â°C. Fenofibrate is a white solid which is stable under ordinary conditions.</p><p><span class="Bold">Inactive Ingredients</span>: Each gelatin capsule contains hypromellose, simethicone emulsion, sodium lauryl sulphate, sugar spheres and talc. The capsule shell contains the following inactive ingredients: black iron oxide, D &amp; C Yellow 10, potassium hydroxide, propylene glycol, gelatin, shellac, sodium lauryl sulphate, titanium dioxide. The 30 mg capsule shell contains following additional inactive ingredients: FD &amp; C Blue 2, yellow iron oxide. The 90 mg capsule shell contains following additional inactive ingredients: FD &amp; C Blue 1, FD &amp; C Yellow 6.</p><h2>Fenofibrate Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The active moiety of fenofibrate capsule is fenofibric acid. The pharmacological effects of fenofibric acid in both animals and humans have been extensively studied through oral administration of fenofibrate.</p><p>The lipid lowering effects of fenofibric acid seen in clinical practice have been explained <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in transgenic mice and <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in human hepatocyte cultures by the activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î± (PPAR<span class="Italics">Î±</span>). Through this mechanism, fenofibrate increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein C-III (an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity). The resulting decrease in triglycerides produces an alteration in the size and composition of LDL from small, dense particles (which are thought to be atherogenic due to their susceptibility to oxidation), to large buoyant particles. These larger particles have a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors and are catabolized rapidly. Activation of PPARÎ± also induces an increase in the synthesis of apoproteins A-I, A-II and HDL-cholesterol.</p><p>Fenofibrate also reduces serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic and normal individuals by increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A variety of clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total-C, DL-C, and Apo B, an LDL membrane complex, are associated with human atherosclerosis. Similarly, decreased levels of HDL-C and its transport complex, apolipoprotein A (Apo AI and Apo All) are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic investigations have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides, and inversely with the level of HDL-C. The independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</p><p>Fenofibric acid, the active metabolite of fenofibrate, produces reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total triglycerides, and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (VLDL) in treated patients. In addition, treatment with fenofibrate results in increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoproteins Apo AI and Apo AII.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Fenofibrate is a pro-drug of the active chemical moiety fenofibric acid.  Fenofibrate is converted by ester hydrolysis in the body to fenofibric acid which is the active constituent measurable in the circulation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The absolute bioavailability of fenofibrate cannot be determined as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection. However, fenofibrate is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Following oral administration in healthy volunteers, approximately 60% of a single dose of  radiolabeled fenofibrate appeared in urine, primarily as fenofibric acid and its glucuronate conjugate, and 25% was excreted in the feces. Peak plasma levels of fenofibric acid from Fenofibrate Capsules 90 mg occur within 2 to 6 hours after administration.</p><p>In the presence of a high-fat meal, there was a 26.7% increase in AUC and 15.35% increase in Cmax of fenofibric acid from fenofibrate capsule 30mg relative to fasting state,</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>In healthy volunteers, steady-state plasma levels of fenofibric acid were shown to be achieved within a week of dosing and did not demonstrate accumulation across time following multiple dose administration. Serum protein binding was approximately 99% in normal and hyperlipidemic subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Following oral administration, fenofibrate is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to the active metabolite, fenofibric acid; no unchanged fenofibrate is detected in plasma.</p><p>Fenofibric acid is primarily conjugated with glucuronic acid and then excreted in urine. A small amount of fenofibric acid is reduced at the carbonyl moiety to a benzhydrol metabolite which is, in turn, conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vivo</span> metabolism data indicate that neither fenofibrate nor fenofibric acid undergo oxidative metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450) to a significant extent.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>After absorption, fenofibrate is mainly excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites, primarily fenofibric acid and fenofibric acid glucuronide. After administration of radiolabeled fenofibrate, approximately 60% of the dose appeared in the urine and 25% was excreted in the feces.</p><p>Fenofibrate acid from fenofibrate capsule is eliminated with a half-life of 23 hours, allowing once daily dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatrics</span></p><p>In elderly volunteers 77 to 87 years of age, the oral clearance of fenofibric acid following a single oral dose of fenofibrate was 1.2 L/h, which compares to 1.1 L/h in young adults. This indicates that a similar dosage regimen can be used in the elderly with normal renal function, without increasing accumulation of the drug or metabolites [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Use in Special Populations (8.5)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of Fenofibrate Capsules has not been studied in pediatric populations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gender</span></p><p>No pharmacokinetic difference between males and females has been observed for fenofibrate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race</span></p><p>The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibrate has not been studied; however, fenofibrate is not metabolized by enzymes known for exhibiting inter-ethnic variability.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of fenofibric acid was examined in patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] â‰¤ 30 mL/min or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>) showed 2.7-fold increase in exposure for fenofibric acid and increased accumulation of fenofibric acid during chronic dosing compared to that of healthy subjects.

In the first 24-month study, Wistar rats were dosed with fenofibrate at 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.3, 1, and 6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), based on body surface area comparisons (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). At a dose of 200 mg/kg/day (at 6 times the MRHD), the incidence of liver carcinomas was significantly increased in both sexes. A statistically significant increase in pancreatic carcinomas was observed in males at 1 and 6 times the MRHD; an increase in pancreatic adenomas and benign testicular interstitial cell tumors was observed at 6 times the MRHD in males. In a second 24-month rat carcinogenicity study in a different strain of rats (Sprague-Dawley), doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD) produced significant increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes and increases in testicular interstitial cell tumors in males at 2 times the MRHD.</p><p>A 117-week carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats comparing three drugs: fenofibrate 10 and 60 mg/kg/day (0.3 and 2 times the MRHD), clofibrate (400 mg/kg/day; 2 times the human dose), and gemfibrozil (250 mg/kg/day; 2 times the human dose, based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>surface area). Fenofibrate increased pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes. Clofibrate increased hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic acinar adenomas in males and hepatic neoplastic nodules in females. Gemfibrozil increased hepatic neoplastic nodules in males and females, while all three drugs increased testicular interstitial cell tumors in males.</p><p>In a 21-month study in CF-1 mice, fenofibrate 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2, 1, and 3 times the MRHD on the basis of mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>surface area) significantly increased the liver carcinomas in both sexes at 3 times the MRHD. In a second 18-month study at 10, 60, and 200 mg/kg/day, fenofibrate significantly increased the liver carcinomas in male mice and liver adenomas in female mice at 3 times the MRHD.</p><p>Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated peroxisomal proliferation following fenofibrate administration to the rat. An adequate study to test for peroxisome proliferation in humans has not been done, but changes in peroxisome morphology and numbers have been observed in humans after treatment with other members of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and after treatment in the same individual.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Fenofibrate has been demonstrated to be devoid of mutagenic potential in the following tests: Ames, mouse lymphoma, chromosomal aberration and unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocytes.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>In fertility studies rats were given oral dietary doses of fenofibrate, males received 61 days prior to mating and females 15 days prior to mating through weaning which resulted in no adverse effect on fertility at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (~10 times the MRHD, based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>surface area comparisons).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Non familial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia</h3><p class="First">The effects of fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 90 mg Fenofibrate Capsules per day were assessed from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group studies including patients with the following mean baseline lipid values: total-C 306.9 mg/dL; LDL-C 213.8 mg/dL; HDL-C 52.3 mg/dL; and triglycerides 191.0 mg/dL. Fenofibrate therapy lowered LDL-C, Total-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Fenofibrate therapy also lowered triglycerides and raised HDL-C (See Table 4).</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">â€ </span></span> Duration of study treatment was 3 to 6 months.</p><p>In a subset of the subjects, measurements of Apo B were conducted. Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced Apo B from baseline to endpoint as compared with placebo (-25.1% vs. 2.4%, p&lt;0.0001, n=213 and 143 respectively).</p><h3>Severe Hypertriglyceridemia</h3><p class="First">The effects of fenofibrate on serum triglycerides were studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 147 hypertriglyceridemic patients. Patients were treated for eight weeks under protocols that differed only in that one entered patients with baseline TG levels of 500 to 1500 mg/dL, and the other TG levels of 350 to 499 mg/dL. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal cholesterolemia with or without hyperchylomicronemia , treatment with fenofibrate at dosages equivalent to 90 mg Fenofibrate Capsules per day decreased primarily very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol Treatment of patients with elevated triglycerides often results in an increase of LDL-C (See Table 5).</p><p>The effect of Fenofibrate Capsules on serum triglycerides was studied in a double-blind, randomized, 3 arm parallel-group trial of 146. The study population was comprised of 61 % male and 39% female patients. Approximately 70% of patients had hypertension and 32% had diabetes. Patients were treated for eight weeks with either Fenofibrate Capsules equivalent to 90 mg taken once daily with meals, Fenofibrate Capsules equivalent to 90 mg taken once daily between meals, or placebo. Fenofibrate Capsules equivalent to 90 mg, whether taken with meals or between meals, had comparable effects on TG and all lipid parameters (See Table 6).</p><p>The effect of Fenofibrate Capsules on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Fenofibrate Capsules, 30 mg are size '4' capsules with opaque light green cap and opaque light green body, imprinted with LUPIN logo and "ANTARA"  in black ink on body, and "30" in black ink on cap, containing white to off-white pellets.</p><p>NDC 68180-745-06                              30's Bottle</p><p>Fenofibrate Capsules, 90 mg are size '3' capsules with opaque dark green cap and opaque white body, imprinted with LUPIN logo and "ANTARA"  in black ink on body, and "90" in black ink on cap, containing white to off-white pellets.</p><p>NDC 68180-746-06                              30's Bottle</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>Store at 25Â°C (77Â°F); excursions permitted to 15Â° to 30Â°C (59Â°to 86Â°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature] in a tightly closed container.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Patients should be advised:</p><ul class="Disc">
