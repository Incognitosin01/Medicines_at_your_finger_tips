Ubiquinone is also known as Coenzima, Ubidcarenone, Ubidécarénone, and Ubiquinol.</p><p>Ubiquinone is likely effective in alternative medicine as an aid in treating coenzyme Q-10 deficiency, or reducing the symptoms of mitochondrial disorders (conditions that affect energy-production in the cells of the body).</p><p>Ubiquinone is also possibly effective in preventing migraine headaches, lowering blood pressure, preventing a second heart attack, or slowing the progression of early Parkinson's disease. Ubiquinone is also possibly effective in improving symptoms in people with congestive heart failure, nerve problems caused by diabetes, Huntington's disease, muscular dystrophy, or macular degeneration (age-related vision loss).</p><p>Ubiquinone has also been used to treat Alzheimer's disease, high cholesterol, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease). However, research has shown that ubiquinone may not be effective in treating these conditions.</p><p>Research also has shown that ubiquinone is not likely to be effective in increasing athletic performance.</p><p>Other uses not proven with research have included treating asthma, COPD, cancer, diabetes, certain heart problems, fibromyalgia, hepatitis C, kidney problems, high blood pressure during pregnancy, muscle problems caused by taking "statin" cholesterol medicine, and other conditions.</p><p>Ubiquinone is often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.</p><p>Ubiquinone may also be used for purposes not listed in this product guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on the product label and package.
