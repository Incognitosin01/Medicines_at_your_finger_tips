If high doses (eg, &gt;10 million units) are used, administer at a slower rate (eg, &gt;30 minutes for intermittent IV infusion).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Periodic electrolyte, hepatic, renal, cardiac and hematologic function tests during prolonged/high-dose therapy; observe for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis during first dose. In older adults, especially those with decreased renal function, monitor for seizure activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Penicillin G crosses the placenta.</p><p>In a study of women administered IV penicillin G (parenteral/aqueous) for group B streptococcal (GBS) disease, peak fetal concentrations occurred within 1 hour (Barber 2008).</p><p>Penicillin is widely used in pregnant women. Based on available data, penicillin is generally considered compatible for use during pregnancy (Ailes 2016; Bookstaver 2015; Crider 2009; Damkier 2019; Erić 2012; Heinonen 1977; Lamont 2014; Muanda 2017a; Muanda 2017b).</p><p>Maternal penicillin G serum concentrations are not decreased in obese patients following IV administration for GBS prophylaxis; however, cord blood concentrations may be less. Based on available data, minimum inhibitory concentrations for GBS are still achieved (McCoy 2020). Penicillin G (parenteral/aqueous) is the drug of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis to prevent neonatal GBS early onset disease. Untreated asymptomatic GBS disease can result in maternal urinary tract infection, intraamniotic infection, endometritis, preterm labor, and/or stillbirth. Vertical transmission from the mother can cause sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis in the newborn. Treatment is intended to prevent early-onset disease in newborns. Prophylaxis is reserved for pregnant patients with a positive GBS vaginal or rectal screening in late gestation, GBS bacteriuria during the current pregnancy, history of birth of an infant with early-onset GBS disease, and unknown GBS culture status with any of the following: birth &lt;37 0/7 weeks gestation, intrapartum fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, known GBS positive in a previous pregnancy, or intrapartum nucleic acid amplification testing positive for GBS (ACOG 2020).</p><p>Penicillin G is the drug of choice for treatment of syphilis during pregnancy (CDC [Workowski 2015]). Untreated maternal syphilis can cause congenital syphilis which is associated with bone deformities, neurologic impairment, stillbirth, or neonatal death (USPSTF 2018). Symptoms of congenital syphilis may include hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, nonimmune hydrops, pseudoparalysis of an extremity, rhinitis, or skin rash. The CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines provide recommendations for the treatment of syphilis in pregnant patients. The penicillin regimen (dose, duration, and preparation) for the treatment of pregnant patients is the same as for a nonpregnant patient and depends on the stage of syphilis. Parenteral penicillin G is the only agent with documented efficacy in pregnancy. Patients who are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. Pregnant women being treated for latent syphilis must repeat the full course of therapy if any doses are missed. A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction may occur in any patient within the first 24 hours of therapy, including pregnant women. This reaction may induce early labor or fetal distress; however, it is not a reason to prevent or delay maternal therapy (CDC [Workowski 2015]).</p><p>Maternal infection with <i>Bacillus anthracis </i>may cause preterm labor, fetal infection, fetal distress, or fetal loss. Maternal death may also occur. When IV therapy is required for anthrax infection in pregnant and postpartum women, penicillin G may be used as an alternative agent. The dose and duration of antibiotic therapy in pregnant and postpartum women is the same as in nonpregnant adults. Adjustments in dose for pregnancy are not recommended until additional pharmacokinetic data becomes available (Meaney-Delman 2014).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat bacterial infections.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
