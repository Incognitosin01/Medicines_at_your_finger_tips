class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to any penicillin or any component of the formulation</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for beta-lactams (eg, penicillins and cephalosporins) is limited. However, because of similarities in chemical structure and/or pharmacologic actions, the possibility of cross-sensitivity cannot be ruled out with certainty.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> For ease of outpatient administration, the total daily dose may be administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion (AHA [Baddour 2015]; IDSA [Berbari 2015]; IDSA [Osmon 2013]; Walton 2007).</p><p><b>Actinomycosis, severe or extensive: IV:</b> 10 to 20 million units/day as a continuous infusion or in divided doses every 4 to 6 hours for 4 to 6 weeks followed by appropriate long-term oral therapy (Brook 2008; Brook 2020).</p><p><b>Bloodstream infection: </b></p><p><i>Pathogen-directed therapy for Enterococcus spp. (off-label use): </i><b>IV:</b> 18 to 30 million units/day as a continuous infusion or in divided doses every 4 hours; use as part of an appropriate combination regimen in the setting of suspected endocarditis or critical illness (IDSA [Mermel 2009]; Murray 2020). Duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days for uncomplicated infection (ie, fever resolution within 72 hours <b>and</b> absence of metastatic focus of infection or endovascular hardware) (IDSA [Mermel 2009]).

Dilute further, up to 100,000 units/mL, for less discomfort. If larger doses are needed, consider IV infusion.</p><p><i>Intrapleural: </i>If fluid is aspirated, administer local infusion in a volume equal to 25 to 50% of the amount of fluid aspirated. If fluid is not aspirated, prepare as directed for IM injection and infuse locally.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM: Administer IM by deep injection in the upper outer quadrant of the buttock. Administer injection around-the-clock to promote less variation in peak and trough levels.</p><p>IV: Usually administered by intermittent infusion. In some centers, large doses may be administered by continuous IV infusion. <b>Note:</b> The 20 million unit dosage form may be administered by IV infusion only.</p><p><i>Intermittent IV:</i> Infuse over 15 to 30 minutes.</p><h2>Dietary Considerations</h2><p>Some products may contain potassium and/or sodium.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Penicillin G potassium powder for injection should be stored below 86Â°F (30Â°C). Following reconstitution, solution may be stored for up to 7 days under refrigeration. Premixed bags for infusion should be stored at -20Â°C or -4Â°F; frozen bags may be thawed at 25Â°C (77Â°F) or in a refrigerator (5Â°C [41Â°F]). Once thawed, solution is stable for 14 days at 5Â°C (41Â°F) or for 24 hours at 25Â°C (77Â°F). Do not refreeze once thawed.</p><p>Penicillin G sodium powder for injection should be stored at 20Â°C to 25Â°C (68Â°F to 87Â°F). Once reconstituted, the manufacturer recommends refrigeration (2Â°C to 8Â°C [36Â°F to 46Â°F]) and use within 3 days of reconstitution. After further dilution to 2,500 to 50,000 units/mL in either D5W or NS (in PVC bags or elastomeric pump containers), one study demonstrated stability when stored under refrigeration for up to 21 days (Hossain 2014).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Acemetacin: May increase the serum concentration of Penicillins.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Aminoglycosides: Penicillins may decrease the serum concentration of Aminoglycosides.

If high doses (eg, &gt;10 million units) are used, administer at a slower rate (eg, &gt;30 minutes for intermittent IV infusion).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Periodic electrolyte, hepatic, renal, cardiac and hematologic function tests during prolonged/high-dose therapy; observe for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis during first dose. In older adults, especially those with decreased renal function, monitor for seizure activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Penicillin G crosses the placenta.</p><p>In a study of women administered IV penicillin G (parenteral/aqueous) for group B streptococcal (GBS) disease, peak fetal concentrations occurred within 1 hour (Barber 2008).</p><p>Penicillin is widely used in pregnant women. Based on available data, penicillin is generally considered compatible for use during pregnancy (Ailes 2016; Bookstaver 2015; Crider 2009; Damkier 2019; EriÄ‡ 2012; Heinonen 1977; Lamont 2014; Muanda 2017a; Muanda 2017b).</p><p>Maternal penicillin G serum concentrations are not decreased in obese patients following IV administration for GBS prophylaxis; however, cord blood concentrations may be less. Based on available data, minimum inhibitory concentrations for GBS are still achieved (McCoy 2020). Penicillin G (parenteral/aqueous) is the drug of choice for intrapartum prophylaxis to prevent neonatal GBS early onset disease. Untreated asymptomatic GBS disease can result in maternal urinary tract infection, intraamniotic infection, endometritis, preterm labor, and/or stillbirth. Vertical transmission from the mother can cause sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis in the newborn. Treatment is intended to prevent early-onset disease in newborns. Prophylaxis is reserved for pregnant patients with a positive GBS vaginal or rectal screening in late gestation, GBS bacteriuria during the current pregnancy, history of birth of an infant with early-onset GBS disease, and unknown GBS culture status with any of the following: birth &lt;37 0/7 weeks gestation, intrapartum fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, known GBS positive in a previous pregnancy, or intrapartum nucleic acid amplification testing positive for GBS (ACOG 2020).</p><p>Penicillin G is the drug of choice for treatment of syphilis during pregnancy (CDC [Workowski 2015]). Untreated maternal syphilis can cause congenital syphilis which is associated with bone deformities, neurologic impairment, stillbirth, or neonatal death (USPSTF 2018). Symptoms of congenital syphilis may include hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, nonimmune hydrops, pseudoparalysis of an extremity, rhinitis, or skin rash. The CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines provide recommendations for the treatment of syphilis in pregnant patients. The penicillin regimen (dose, duration, and preparation) for the treatment of pregnant patients is the same as for a nonpregnant patient and depends on the stage of syphilis. Parenteral penicillin G is the only agent with documented efficacy in pregnancy. Patients who are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. Pregnant women being treated for latent syphilis must repeat the full course of therapy if any doses are missed. A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction may occur in any patient within the first 24 hours of therapy, including pregnant women. This reaction may induce early labor or fetal distress; however, it is not a reason to prevent or delay maternal therapy (CDC [Workowski 2015]).</p><p>Maternal infection with <i>Bacillus anthracis </i>may cause preterm labor, fetal infection, fetal distress, or fetal loss. Maternal death may also occur. When IV therapy is required for anthrax infection in pregnant and postpartum women, penicillin G may be used as an alternative agent. The dose and duration of antibiotic therapy in pregnant and postpartum women is the same as in nonpregnant adults. Adjustments in dose for pregnancy are not recommended until additional pharmacokinetic data becomes available (Meaney-Delman 2014).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>â€¢ It is used to treat bacterial infections.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
