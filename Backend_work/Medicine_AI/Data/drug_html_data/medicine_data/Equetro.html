Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant that works by decreasing nerve impulses that cause seizures and pain.</p><p>Equetro is used for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Exactly how it works to treat bipolar episodes is not known.</p><p>Equetro is also used to treat seizures and nerve pain such as trigeminal neuralgia.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not take Equetro if you have a history of bone marrow suppression, or if you are allergic to it or to an antidepressant such as amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, or nortriptyline.</p><p>TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL OTHER MEDICINES YOU USE. Some drugs can raise or lower your blood levels of carbamazepine, which may cause side effects or make this medicine less effective. Carbamazepine can also affect blood levels of certain other drugs, making them less effective or increasing side effects.</p><p>Equetro may cause serious blood problems or a life-threatening skin rash or allergic reaction. <b>Call your doctor if you have a fever, unusual weakness, bleeding, bruising, or a skin rash that causes blistering and peeling.</b></p><p>Some people have thoughts about suicide while taking seizure medicine. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor.</p><p>Do not stop taking Equetro without asking your doctor first, even if you feel fine.</p><p><b>If you are pregnant, do not start or stop taking Equetro without your doctor's advice.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take Equetro if you have a history of bone marrow suppression, or if you are allergic to carbamazepine or to an antidepressant such as amitriptyline, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, or nortriptyline.</p><p>Do not use carbamazepine if you have taken an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include furazolidone, isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.</p><p>Equetro may cause severe or life-threatening skin rash, and especially in people of Asian ancestry. Your doctor may recommend a blood test before you start the medication to determine your risk.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

Do not <b>start</b> or <b>stop</b> taking Equetro without your doctor's advice. Carbamazepine may harm an unborn baby, but having a seizure during pregnancy could harm both mother and baby. The benefit of preventing seizures may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p><b>Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.</b></p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of carbamazepine on the baby.</p><p>Equetro can make birth control pills or implants less effective.

Swallow right away without chewing. Do not save the mixture for later use. Discard the empty capsule.</p><p>It may take up to 4 weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medication as directed and <b>call your doctor promptly if Equetro seems to stop working as well in preventing your seizures.</b></p><p>While using Equetro, you may need frequent blood tests at your doctor's office.</p><p><b>Do not stop taking Equetro without asking your doctor first</b>, even if you feel fine. You may have increased seizures or unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you stop using Equetro suddenly.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
