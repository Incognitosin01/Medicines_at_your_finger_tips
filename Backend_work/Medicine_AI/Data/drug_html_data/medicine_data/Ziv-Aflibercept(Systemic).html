Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia have also occurred. Monitor CBC with differential (baseline and prior to each cycle); delay treatment until ANC is ≥1,500/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>• Diarrhea: Severe diarrhea and dehydration (grades 3 and 4) have been reported with ziv-aflibercept. The incidence of diarrhea is increased in patients ≥65 years of age; monitor elderly patients closely for diarrhea.</p><p>• Fistula formation: The risk for GI and non-GI fistulas is increased with ziv-aflibercept. Fistula sites have included anal, enterovesical, enterocutaneous, colovaginal, and intestinal. Discontinue ziv-aflibercept in patients who develop fistula.</p><p>• GI perforation: GI perforation, including fatal GI perforation, may occur in patients receiving ziv-aflibercept. Discontinue ziv-aflibercept therapy in patients who experience GI perforation. Monitor for signs/symptoms of GI perforation.</p><p>• Hemorrhage: The risk for hemorrhage is increased with ziv-aflibercept. Severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhage, including GI bleeding, has been reported in patients who have received ziv-aflibercept in combination with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of GI bleeding and other severe bleeding. Do not administer ziv-aflibercept to patients with severe hemorrhage. Discontinue if severe hemorrhage develops. Grade 3 and 4 hemorrhagic events, including hematuria and postprocedural hemorrhage, have been reported. Intracranial hemorrhage and pulmonary hemorrhage/hemoptysis (including fatal events) have also occurred.</p><p>• Hepatitis B virus screening: The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.</p><p>• Hypertension: The risk for grades 3 or 4 hypertension is increased with ziv-aflibercept. Onset is generally within the first 2 treatment cycles. Monitor blood pressure every 2 weeks (more frequently if clinically indicated). Manage with appropriate antihypertensive therapy (may require adjustment of existing antihypertensives). Temporarily withhold ziv-aflibercept treatment with uncontrolled hypertension; may reinitiate with permanent dose reduction when controlled. Discontinue for hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. Patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure were excluded from clinical trials.</p><p>• Proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome: Severe proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) have been associated with ziv-aflibercept. Evaluate for proteinuria during treatment with urine dipstick and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR); if dipstick ≥2+ for protein or UPCR &gt;1, obtain 24-hour urine collection. Withhold ziv-aflibercept for proteinuria ≥2 g per 24 hours; for recurrent proteinuria, withhold treatment until &lt;2 g per 24 hours and then resume with permanent dose reduction. Discontinue treatment for nephrotic syndrome or TMA.</p><p>• Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome: Cases of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome have been reported. Confirm diagnosis with MRI; discontinue ziv-aflibercept if verified. Symptoms generally resolve or improve within days, although persistent neurologic symptoms and death have been reported</p><p>• Thromboembolism: Arterial thrombotic events (ATE), including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, and angina, have occurred. Discontinue ziv-aflibercept in patients who experience ATEs.</p><p>• Wound healing impairment: Severely compromised wound healing may occur in patients receiving ziv-aflibercept with FOLFIRI. Discontinue ziv-aflibercept in patients with compromised wound healing. Suspend ziv-aflibercept for at least 4 weeks prior to elective surgery, and do not resume ziv-aflibercept for at least 4 weeks after major surgery AND until the surgical wound is completely healed. For minor surgeries (eg, central venous access port placement, biopsy, tooth extraction), ziv-aflibercept may be resumed or initiated as soon as the surgical wound is fully healed. The safety of resuming ziv-aflibercept treatment after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Certain adverse events, such as diarrhea, dizziness, weakness, weight loss, and dehydration, occurred at a higher incidence in elderly patients compared to younger adults; monitor closely during treatment.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential (baseline and prior to each cycle); urine protein (dipstick analysis and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio [UPCR], obtain 24-hour urine collection if dipstick ≥2+ for protein or UPCR &gt;1); blood pressure (every 2 weeks; more frequently if clinically indicated). Hepatitis B virus screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) prior to beginning systemic anticancer therapy (ASCO [Hwang 2020]). Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential. Monitor for signs/symptoms of hemorrhage or GI perforation; monitor elderly patients closely for diarrhea and/or dehydration. Monitor wounds for healing impairment.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ziv-aflibercept. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during therapy and for 1 month following the last ziv-aflibercept dose. Ziv-aflibercept may impair reproductive function in males and females of reproductive potential.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on the mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to ziv-aflibercept may cause fetal harm. Aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor; VEGF is required to achieve and maintain normal pregnancies (Peracha 2016).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat colorectal cancer.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
