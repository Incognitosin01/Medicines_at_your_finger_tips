</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Setlakin</h2><p class="First">Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy.</p><h2>Setlakin Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>How to Start SetlakinTM</h3><p class="First">Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> is dispensed in an Extended-Cycle Tablet Dispenser <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (</span>16<span class="Italics">)].</span> Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> should be started on a Sunday (see Table 1).

</ul><p>●Women over age 35 with any migraine headaches <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.7<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>● Liver tumors, benign or malignant, or liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">) and Use in Specific Populations (</span>8.6<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>● Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.8<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>● Pregnancy, because there is no reason to use COCs during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.9<span class="Italics">) and Use in Specific Populations (</span>8.1<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>● Breast cancer or other estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancer, now or in the past <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.11<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>● Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.3<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Stop Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs.</li>
<li>Stop Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately.</li>
<li>If feasible, stop Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization.</li>
<li>Start Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</li>
<li>The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman- years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</li>
<li>Use of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly COCs containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins (an additional 9 weeks of exposure per year). In the clinical trial, one case of pulmonary embolism was reported. Postmarketing adverse reactions of VTE have been reported in women who used Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>.</li>
<li>Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. Stroke has been reported in women associated with the use of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke.</li>
</ul><p class="First">   Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impaired Liver Function</span></p><p>Do not use Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4<span class="Italics">)]</span>. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> if jaundice develops.</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver Tumors</span></p><p>Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4<span class="Italics">)]</span>. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt; 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains obmitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4<span class="Italics">)]</span>. Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4<span class="Italics">)].</span> For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease.</p><p>A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC-related cholestasis.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.</p><p>Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.</p><p>Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> if indicated.</p><p>Consider discontinuation of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First">Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets of each extended-cycle regimen is considered "unscheduled" bleeding/spotting. Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven white inert tablets is considered "scheduled" bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Unscheduled and Scheduled Bleeding and Spotting</span></p><p>Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first 3 months of use. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.</p><p>Before prescribing Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg, advise the woman to weigh the convenience of fewer scheduled menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting.</p><p>The clinical trial of the efficacy of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg (91-day cycles) in preventing pregnancy also assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the study were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously as opposed to new users. Women with a history of breakthrough bleeding/spotting    10 consecutive days on oral contraceptives were excluded from the study. More Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg subjects, compared to subjects on the comparator 28-day cycle regimen, discontinued prematurely for unacceptable bleeding (7.7% [Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg] vs. 1.8% [28-day cycle regimen]).</p><p>Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91-day cycles. Table 3 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting for each respective 91-day cycle.</p><p>Table 4 shows the percentages of women with    7 days and    20 days of unscheduled spotting and/or bleeding in the Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> and the 28-day cycle treatment groups.</p><p>Total days of bleeding and/or spotting (scheduled plus unscheduled) were similar over one year of treatment for Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> subjects and subjects on the 28-day cycle regimen.</p><p><span class="Bold">Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea</span></p><p>Women who are not pregnant and use Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> may experience amenorrhea. Based on data from the clinical trial, amenorrhea occurred in approximately 0.8% of women during Cycle 1, 1.2% of women during Cycle 2, 3.7% of women during Cycle 3, and 3.4% of women during Cycle 4. Because women using Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> will likely have scheduled bleeding only 4 times per year, rule out pregnancy at the time of any missed menstrual period.</p><p>Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> use if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span>8.1<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Depression associated with the use of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> has been reported. Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> if severe depression recurs.</p><h3>Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix</h3><p class="First">Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><p>Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</p><h3>Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care.</p><h3>Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to develop chloasma should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>● Serious cardiovascular events and stroke <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.1<span class="Italics">)]</span></p><p>● Vascular events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.1<span class="Italics">)]</span></p><p>● Liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">)]</span></p><p>Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:</p><p>● Irregular uterine bleeding</p><p>● Nausea</p><p>● Breast tenderness</p><p>● Headache</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg was a 12-month, randomized, multicenter, open-label study, which enrolled women aged 18-40, of whom 456 took at least one dose of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg (345.14 woman-years of exposure) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (</span>14<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation</span>: 14.9% of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions (   1% of women) leading to discontinuation in the Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg group were menorrhagia (5.7%), mood swings (1.9%), weight/appetite increase (1.5%), and acne (1.3%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Common Adverse Reactions (   2% of women)</span>: headache (20.6%), menorrhagia (11.6%), nausea (7.5%), dysmenorrhea (5.7%), acne (4.6%), migraine (4.4%), breast tenderness (3.5%), weight increased (3.1%), and depression (2.1%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious Adverse Reactions: </span> pulmonary embolus, cholecystitis.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders</span>: abdominal distension, vomiting</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions</span>: chest pain, fatigue, malaise, edema peripheral, pain <span class="Italics">Immune system disorder: h</span>ypersensitivity reactions, including itching, rash, and angioedema <span class="Italics">Investigations:</span> blood pressure increased</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders</span>: muscle spasms, pain in extremity</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders</span>: dizziness, loss of consciousness</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders</span>: insomnia</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive and breast disorders</span>: dysmenorrhea</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span>: alopecia</p><p><span class="Italics">Vascular disorders</span>: thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary thrombosis</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.</p><h3>Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs:</span></p><p>Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort.</p><p>Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</p><p><span class="Bold">Colesevelam</span>: Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a COC, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart.</p><p><span class="Bold">Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs:</span></p><p>Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20-25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse</span> <span class="Bold">transcriptase inhibitors:</span></p><p>Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors(decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]).</p><h3>Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations.</p><p>COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</p><p>Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.11<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Concomitant Use with Hepatitis C Vaccine (HCV) Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevatio</h3><p class="First">Do not co-administer Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.3<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Interactions with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy.</p><p>Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy. Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception, when possible, until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 as for users 18 years and older. Use of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (</span>4<span class="Italics">) and Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> have not been studied in women with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose of oral contraceptives, including ingestion by children. Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea.</p><h2>Setlakin Description</h2><p class="First">Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) is an extended-cycle combination oral contraceptive consisting of 84 pink active tablets each containing 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel, a synthetic progestin and 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol, an estrogen , and 7 white inert tablets (without hormones).</p><p>The structural formulas for the active components are:</p><p>Levonorgestrel is chemically 18,19-Dinorpregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one, 13-ethyl-17-hydroxy-, (17  )-, (-)-.</p><p>Ethinyl Estradiol is 19-Norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3,17-diol, (17  )-.</p><p>●    Each pink active tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: polyvinyl alcohol,titanium dioxide,talc, macrogol/polyethylene glycol 3350 NF, lecithin (soya), FD&amp;C Red #40 Aluminum Lake, FD&amp;C Blue #2 Aluminum Lake, and FD&amp;C Yellow #6 Aluminum Lake,lactose, magnesium stearate, pregelatinized corn starch and microcrystalline cellulose</p><p>●    Each white inert tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: titanium dioxide,polydextrose, hypromellose, triacetin, macrogol/polyethylene glycol 8000, lactose,magnesium stearate and pregelatinized corn starch.</p><h2>Setlakin - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>No specific investigation of the absolute bioavailability of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> in humans has been conducted. However, literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability nearly 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. EE is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of EE is approximately 43%.</p><p>Following continuous dosing with once-daily administration of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> tablets, plasma concentrations of levonorgestrel and EE reached steady-state within 7 days. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> under fasting conditions in normal healthy women following once-daily administration of one levonorgestrel/EE combination tablet for 10 days are summarized in Table 5.</p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></p><p>The effect of food on the rate and the extent of levonorgestrel and EE absorption following oral administration of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> has not been evaluated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel and EE are reported to be approximately 1.8 L/kg and 4.3 L/kg, respectively. Levonorgestrel is about 97.5 - 99% protein-bound, principally to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and, to a lesser extent, serum albumin. EE is about 95 - 97% bound to serum albumin. EE does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis, which leads to decreased levonorgestrel clearance.</p><p>Following repeated daily dosing of levonorgestrel/EE oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel plasma concentrations accumulate more than predicted based on single-dose pharmacokinetics, due in part, to increased SHBG levels that are induced by EE, and a possible reduction in hepatic metabolic capacity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Following absorption, levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17  -OH position to form sulfate and to a lesser extent, glucuronide conjugates in plasma. Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3  ,5  -tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma, along with much smaller amounts of 3  ,5  -tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16  -hydroxylevonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users.</p><p>First-pass metabolism of EE involves formation of EE-3-sulfate in the gut wall, followed by 2-hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed EE by hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of EE hydroxylation. Hydroxylation at the 4-, 6-, and 16- positions may also occur, although to a much lesser extent than 2-hydroxylation. The various hydroxylated metabolites are subject to further methylation and/or conjugation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>About 45% of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32% are excreted in feces, mostly as glucuronide conjugates. The terminal elimination half-life for levonorgestrel after a single dose of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> was about 30 hours.</p><p>EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and it undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The terminal elimination half-life of EE after a single dose of Setlakin<span class="Sup">TM</span> was found to be about 15 hours.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Italics">,</span> 5.10<span class="Italics">) and Use in Specific Populations (</span>8.1<span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In a 12-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial, 456 women aged 18-40 were studied to assess the safety and efficacy of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets 0.15 mg and 0.03 mg, completing 809 91-day cycles of exposure. The racial demographic of those enrolled was: Caucasian (77%), African-American (11%), Hispanic (7%), Asian (2%), and Other (3%).</p><p>There were no exclusions for body mass index (BMI) or weight. The weight range of those women treated was 84 to 304 pounds, with a mean weight of 157 pounds and a median weight of 147 pounds. Among the women in the trial, 63% were current or recent hormonal contraceptive users, 29% were prior users (who had used hormonal contraceptives in the past but not in the 6 months prior to enrollment), and 8% were new starts.</p><p>The pregnancy rate (Pearl Index [PI]) in the 397 women aged 18-35 years was 1.98 pregnancies per 100 women-years of use (95% CI: 0.54 to 5.03), based on 4 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment</p><p>and within 14 days after the last combination pill.
