<html><head></head><body><h1>Gadobutrol (Intravenous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> gadobutrol (gad-oh-BUE-trol)</p><p>Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. The risk for NSF is greatest in patients with acute kidney injury or chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Evaluate patients for acute kidney injury or other conditions which may reduce renal function. Patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (eg, age greater than 60 years, hypertension, or diabetes) should have their estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) determined through laboratory testing. Do not exceed the recommended gadobutrol dose in patients at highest risk for NSF. Allow sufficient time for the drug to be eliminated by the body prior to subsequent doses .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

MRI scans are a special kind of procedure that lets a doctor look at the inside of the body, such as the brain. They use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of the body. Unlike x-rays, MRI scans do not involve radiation. Gadobutrol is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) that is given by injection before the MRI to help diagnose problems in the brain, spine, breast, and other parts of your body.</p><p>Gadobutrol injection is also used for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to evaluate known or suspected supra-aortic or renal artery disease in adults and children. It is also used to assess how well blood flows through your heart (myocardial perfusion) and late gadolinium enhancement in adult patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).</p><p>Gadobutrol is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using gadobutrol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For gadobutrol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to gadobutrol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadobutrol injection in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in premature infants.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadobutrol injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution in patients receiving gadobutrol.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of gadobutrol. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Allergic disorders, history of or</li>
<li>Bronchial asthma, history of—Use with caution. May increase your risk for an allergic reaction to gadobutrol.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure) or</li>
<li>Infection, severe or—Use with caution. May increase risk for kidney problems.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease, severe (recent or long-term)—Should not be used in patients with this condition unless your doctor specifically tells you that it is necessary.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of gadobutrol</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you or your child gadobutrol in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins just before you have an MRI or MRA scan.</p><p>Gadobutrol comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using gadobutrol</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress while you are receiving gadobutrol and during the MRI or MRA scan</i> to make sure gadobutrol is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have burning or itching of the skin, deep bone pain in the hips or ribs, joint stiffness, a limited range of motion in the arms and legs, muscle weakness, red or dark patches on the skin of the arms or legs, or skin swelling, hardening, or tightening within the first few days or weeks after you receive gadobutrol. These may be symptoms of a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).</p><p>Gadobutrol may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you or your child have chest pain, cold, clammy skin, confusion, dizziness, lightheadedness, a skin rash, itching, sweating, swelling of the face, tongue, and throat, or trouble with breathing after receiving the medicine.</p><p>Gadobutrol contains a metal called gadolinium, which can stay in your body (including the brain, bones, skin, liver, kidney, spleen) for a long time (several months to years). Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.</p><p>Gadobutrol may increase your risk of having acute kidney injury (AKI). This has occurred in patients with severe kidney problems, and the risk is increased if you or your child are receiving high doses of gadobutrol.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have burning pain, feeling of warmth or coldness, redness or swelling at the injection site.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Gadobutrol side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
