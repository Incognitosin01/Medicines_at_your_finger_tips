Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, with multiple organ involvement, have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; although, hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.<br/>

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and have discontinued lamivudine, which is a component of abacavir and lamivudine. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue abacavir and lamivudine and are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</span></span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets</h2><p class="First">Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, are indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.</p><h2>Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Screening for HLA-B*5701 Allele prior to Starting Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets</h3><p class="First">Screen for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir and lamivudine <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h3>Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets for adults is one tablet taken orally once daily, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, with or without food.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended oral dose of abacavir and lamivudine for pediatric patients weighing at least 25 kg is one tablet daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span> Before prescribing Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets, pediatric patients should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets.</p><h3>Not Recommended Due to Lack of Dosage Adjustment</h3><p class="First">Because abacavir and lamivudine is a fixed-dose tablet and cannot be dose adjusted, Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets are not recommended for:<br/></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per minute <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></li>
<li>patients with mild hepatic impairment. Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p>Use of EPIVIR (lamivudine) oral solution or tablets and ZIAGEN (abacavir) oral solution may be considered.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets USP 600 mg/300 mg contain 600 mg of abacavir as abacavir sulfate and 300 mg of lamivudine. The tablets are orange colored, modified capsule shaped, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘H’ on one side and ‘27’ on other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Abacavir and Lamivudine Tablets are contraindicated in patients:</p><p>• who have the HLA-B*5701 allele <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span><br/>
• with prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> or lamivudine.<br/>
• with moderate or severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine. These hypersensitivity reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and typically occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir (median time to onset was 9 days); although abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at a higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; although, patients who do not carry the HLA-B*5701 allele have developed hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 206 (8%) of 2,670 patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed. The incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in clinical trials was 1% when subjects carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele were excluded. In any patient treated with abacavir, the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision making.</p><p>Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>All patients should be screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with abacavir and lamivudine or reinitiation of therapy with abacavir and lamivudine, unless patients have a previously documented HLA-B*5701 allele assessment.</li>
<li>Abacavir and lamivudine is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA-B*5701-positive patients.</li>
<li>Before starting abacavir and lamivudine, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir­-containing product. NEVER restart abacavir and lamivudine or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status.</li>
<li>To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA-B*5701 status, discontinue abacavir and lamivudine immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications).</li>
<li>If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart abacavir and lamivudine or any other abacavir-containing products because more severe symptoms, which may include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours.</li>
<li>If a hypersensitivity reaction is ruled out, patients may restart abacavir and lamivudine. Rarely, patients who have stopped abacavir for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity have also experienced life-threatening reactions within hours of reinitiating abacavir therapy.</li>
</ul><p>      Therefore, reintroduction of abacavir and lamivudine or any other abacavir-containing product is recommended only if medical care can be readily accessed.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>A Medication Guide and Warning Card that provide information about recognition of hypersensitivity reactions should be dispensed with each new prescription and refill.</li>
</ul><h3>Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis</span></p><p>Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine). Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV</span></p><p>Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus. See full prescribing information for EPIVIR (lamivudine).</p><h3>Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis</h3><p class="First">Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir and lamivudine. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN (abacavir) and EPIVIR (lamivudine). Treatment with abacavir and lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir and lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Myocardial Infarction</h3><p class="First">Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain the potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive. </p><p>As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).</p><p>Abacavir sulfate and lamivudine tablets contain FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6 as a color additive.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions<br/></span></p><p>In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.</p><p>Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).</p><p><span class="Bold">Additional Adverse Reactions with Use of abacavir and lamivudine<br/></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Therapy-Naive Adults</span>: Treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions (rated by the investigator as moderate or severe) with greater than or equal to 5% frequency during therapy with ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily or ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily, both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily, are listed in Table 1.</p><p> </p><p><span class="Italics">Laboratory Abnormalities:</span> Laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials of ZIAGEN were anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and elevations of CPK, blood glucose, and triglycerides. Additional laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials of EPIVIR were thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of bilirubin, amylase, and lipase.<br/>
<br/>
The frequencies of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were comparable between treatment groups in CNA30021.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Other Adverse Events:</span> In addition to adverse reactions listed above, other adverse events observed in the expanded access program for abacavir were pancreatitis and increased GGT.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects</h3><p class="First">The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir and lamivudine, administered as either single products or as abacavir and lamivudine, was assessed in the ARROW trial (n = 336). Primary safety assessment in the ARROW (COL105677) trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator. No additional safety issues were identified in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir and lamivudine once-daily compared with historical data in adults <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Abacavir</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Myocardial infarction.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin:</span> Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Abacavir and Lamivudine</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> Redistribution/accumulation of body fat.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digestive:</span> Stomatitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine and Metabolic:</span> Hyperglycemia.</p><p><span class="Italics">General:</span> Weakness.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hemic and Lymphatic:</span> Aplastic anemia, anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy), lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic:</span> Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>, posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis B <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity:</span> Sensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis), urticaria.</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous:</span> Paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures.</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> Abnormal breath sounds/wheezing.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin:</span> Alopecia, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Methadone</h3><p class="First">In a trial of 11 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving methadone-maintenance therapy with 600 mg of ZIAGEN twice daily (twice the currently recommended dose), oral methadone clearance increased <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients; however, an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients.</p><h3>Sorbitol</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with lamivudine-containing medicines <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry<br/></span><br/>
There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir and lamivudine during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Risk Summary<br/></span><br/>
Available data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir or lamivudine compared with the background rate for birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks' gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in fetal malformations and other embryonic and fetal toxicities at exposures 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical daily dose. However, no adverse developmental effects were observed following oral administration of abacavir to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis, at exposures approximately 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose. Oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality at systemic exposure (AUC) similar to the recommended clinical dose; however, no adverse development effects were observed with oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rats during organogenesis at plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) 35 times the recommended clinical dose <span class="Italics">(see Data).<br/></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data:</span> <span class="Italics">Abacavir:</span> Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 2,000 exposures to abacavir during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 1,000 exposed in the first trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for abacavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.0% to 4.1%) following first trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens and 2.7% (95% CI: 1.9% to 3.7%) following second/third trimester exposure to abacavir-containing regimens.<br/>
<br/>
Abacavir has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Lamivudine:</span> Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 11,000 exposures to lamivudine during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 4,500 exposed in the first trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for lamivudine compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.6% to 3.6%) following first trimester exposure to lamivudine-containing regimens and 2.8% (95% CI: 2.5%, 3.3%) following second/third trimester exposure to lamivudine-containing regimens.<br/>
<br/>
Lamivudine pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa. The trials assessed pharmacokinetics in 16 women at 36 weeks' gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, 10 women at 38 weeks' gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, and 10 women at 38 weeks' gestation using lamivudine 300 mg twice daily without other antiretrovirals. These trials were not designed or powered to provide efficacy information. Lamivudine concentrations were generally similar in maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord serum samples. In a subset of subjects, amniotic fluid specimens were collected following natural rupture of membranes and confirmed that lamivudine crosses the placenta in humans. Based on limited data at delivery, median (range) amniotic fluid concentrations of lamivudine were 3.9 (1.2 to 12.8)–fold greater compared with paired maternal serum concentration (n = 8).<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> <span class="Italics">Abacavir:</span> Abacavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 100, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 125, 350, or 700 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on gestation Days 6 through 17 and 6 through 20, respectively). Fetal malformations (increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations) or developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and crown-rump length) were observed in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures approximately 35 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended daily dose. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 100 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) 3.5 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. In a fertility and early embryo-fetal development study conducted in rats (at 60, 160, or 500 mg per kg per day), embryonic and fetal toxicities (increased resorptions, decreased fetal body weights) or toxicities to the offspring (increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights) occurred at doses up to 500 mg per kg per day. No developmental effects were observed in rats at 60 mg per kg per day, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 4 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In pregnant rabbits, no developmental toxicities and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at up to the highest dose evaluated, resulting in exposures (AUC) approximately 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Lamivudine:</span> Lamivudine was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 90, 600, and 4,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 90, 300 and 1,000 mg per kg per day and at 15, 40, and 90 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on gestation Days 7 through 16 [rat] and 8 through 20 [rabbit]). No evidence of fetal malformations due to lamivudine was observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) approximately 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Evidence of early embryolethality was seen in the rabbit at systemic exposures (AUC) similar to those observed in humans, but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that lamivudine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In the fertility/pre-and postnatal development study in rats, lamivudine was administered orally at doses of 180, 900, and 4,000 mg per kg per day from prior to mating through postnatal Day 20). In the study, development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, were not affected by the maternal administration of lamivudine.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span><br/>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Abacavir and lamivudine are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of abacavir and lamivudine on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving abacavir and lamivudine.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The dosing recommendations in this population are based on the safety and efficacy established in a controlled trial conducted using either the combination of EPIVIR and ZIAGEN or abacavir and lamivudine <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><p>In pediatric patients weighing less than 25 kg, use of abacavir and lamivudine as single products is recommended to achieve appropriate dosing.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of abacavir and lamivudine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of abacavir and lamivudine in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Impaired Renal Function</h3><p class="First">Abacavir and lamivudine is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min because abacavir and lamivudine is a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of lamivudine, a component of abacavir and lamivudine, is required for patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min, then the individual components should be used <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function</h3><p class="First">Abacavir and lamivudine are a fixed-dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted. If a dose reduction of abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine, is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), then the individual components should be used <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been established in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment; therefore, abacavir and lamivudine is contraindicated in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no known specific treatment for overdose with abacavir and lamivudine.

<br/>
Abacavir:</span> Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue. Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), an analogue of deoxyguanosine-5’-triphosphate (dGTP). CBV-TP inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. <span class="Italics"><br/>
<br/>
Lamivudine:</span> Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5’-triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (3TC-TP). The principal mode of action of 3TC-TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue. <span class="Bold"><br/>
<br/>
Antiviral Activity</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Abacavir:</span> The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including primary monocytes/macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values ranged from 3.7 to 5.8 microM (1 microM = 0.28 mcg per mL) and 0.07 to 1.0 microM against HIV-1<span class="Sub">IIIB</span> and HIV-1<span class="Sub">BaL</span>, respectively, and the mean EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value was 0.26 ± 0.18 microM against 8 clinical isolates. The median EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values of abacavir were 344 nM (range: 14.8 to 676 nM), 16.9 nM (range: 5.9 to 27.9 nM), 8.1 nM (range: 1.5 to 16.7 nM), 356 nM (range: 35.7 to 396 nM), 105 nM (range: 28.1 to 168 nM), 47.6 nM (range: 5.2 to 200 nM), 51.4 nM (range: 7.1 to 177 nM), and 282 nM (range: 22.4 to 598 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4) ranged from 0.024 to 0.49 microM. <span class="Italics"><br/>
<br/>
Lamivudine:</span> The antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including monocytes and PBMCs using standard susceptibility assays. EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values were in the range of 0.003 to 15 microM (1 microM = 0.23 mcg per mL). The median EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values of lamivudine were 60 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 35 nM (range: 30 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM), 20 nM (range: 3 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 1 to 60 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 30 nM (range: 3 to 70 nM), and 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B), respectively. The EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values against HIV-2 isolates (n = 4) ranged from 0.003 to 0.120 microM in PBMCs. Ribavirin (50 microM) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection decreased the anti-HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5-fold in MT-4 cells.<br/>
<br/>
The combination of abacavir and lamivudine has demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against non-subtype B isolates and HIV-2 isolates with equivalent antiviral activity as for subtype B isolates. Neither abacavir, nor lamivudine, were antagonistic to all tested anti-HIV agents. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN (abacavir) and EPIVIR (lamivudine). Ribavirin, used in the treatment of HCV infection, decreased the anti-HIV-1 potency of abacavir/lamivudine reproducibly by 2- to 6-fold in cell culture. <span class="Bold"><br/>
<br/>
Resistance</span><br/>
<br/>
HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to the combination of abacavir and lamivudine have been selected in cell culture with amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, Y115F, and M184V/I emerging in HIV-1 RT. M184V or I substitutions resulted in high-level resistance to lamivudine and an approximately 2-fold decrease in susceptibility to abacavir. Substitutions K65R, L74M, or Y115F with M184V or I conferred a 7- to 8-fold reduction in abacavir susceptibility, and combinations of three substitutions were required to confer more than an 8-fold reduction in susceptibility. <span class="Bold"><br/>
<br/>
Cross-Resistance</span><br/>
<br/>
Cross-resistance has been observed among nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The combination of abacavir/lamivudine has demonstrated decreased susceptibility to viruses with a K65R substitution with or without an M184V/I substitution, viruses with L74V plus the M184V/I substitution, and viruses with thymidine analog mutation substitutions (TAMs: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219E/R/H/Q/N) plus M184V. An increasing number of TAMs is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenicity</span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
