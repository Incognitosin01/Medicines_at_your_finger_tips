<html><head></head><body><h1>Estring (Vaginal)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> estradiol (es-tra-DYE-ol)</p><p>Estrogens increase the risk of endometrial cancer; monitor for abnormal vaginal bleeding. Estrogens with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia. Increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) have been reported. An increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older has also been reported in women receiving estrogen alone or estrogen combined with progestins. Risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses, combinations, and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins. Estrogens, with or without progestins, should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration possible .</p><p>Use of unopposed estrogens increases the risk of endometrial cancer, while addition of a progestin decreases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. Rule out malignancy if abnormal vaginal bleeding develops. Do not use estrogen alone or in combination with progestin to prevent cardiovascular disease or dementia. There is an increased risk of cardiovascular disorders (ie, DVT, pulmonary embolism, stroke, myocardial infarction) with combination therapy in women 50 years or older, and an increased risk of dementia in women 65 years or older with estrogen monotherapy or combination therapy. Combination therapy also increases the risk of invasive breast cancer. Prescribe estrogens with or without progestins at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with risks and treatment goals .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

The hormone from the vaginal gel or ring is absorbed through your vagina. It works by preventing symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (hot flashes) in women during menopause.</p><p>Estradiol vaginal <i>insert</i> is also used to treat moderate to severe painful sexual intercourse caused by menopause.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Estring</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

It may not be specific to Estring. Please read with care.</b></p><p>It is very important that you <i>use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects.</p><p>This medicine is to be used <i>only in the vagina</i>. Use it at bedtime unless your doctor tells you otherwise.</p><p>This medicine comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>To use the <i>vaginal ring</i>:</p><ul>
<li>This medicine is contained in a ring that you or your caregiver will put into your vagina. The ring will slowly release small amounts of medicine for your body to absorb. Your caregiver will show you how to insert the ring.</li>
<li>Do not remove the ring from the sealed pouch until you are ready to use it.</li>
<li>Once the ring is in place inside your vagina, you should not be able to feel it. If you feel uncomfortable, the ring may not be inserted far enough. Gently push the ring farther into your vagina. If you feel pain, talk to your doctor.</li>
<li>You will leave the ring inside for 90 days (3 months), unless your doctor tells you a different schedule. After that time, remove the ring and insert a new one. If you forget to remove the ring after 90 days, call your doctor for instructions.</li>
<li>The ring may move down into the lower part of your vagina accidently. This can happen if you strain to have a bowel movement. Use your finger to gently push the ring back into place. If the ring comes all the way out of your vagina, rinse it off with warm water and put it back in. Call your doctor if the ring comes out several times.</li>
<li>If you need to remove the ring, hook your finger through the ring and pull it out.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>Imvexxy™ vaginal insert</i>:</p><ul>

<li>You may choose to put the insert into your vagina using the lying down or standing up position. Put the insert about 2 inches into your vagina, with the smaller end up, using your finger.</li>
<li>Most women will start by using a new insert every day for two weeks, then change to using a new insert only 2 days each week. Carefully follow the schedule that your health caregiver tells you to.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>Vagifem® vaginal insert</i>:</p><ul>
<li>The tablet should be used only in your vagina. Do not swallow the tablet.</li>
<li>Each vaginal tablet comes packaged inside an applicator. Do not take the tablet out of the applicator. If the tablet comes out of the applicator but has not fallen out of the package, carefully put it back into the applicator for insertion. If the tablet falls out of the applicator, throw it away and use a new applicator that still has the tablet inside it.</li>
<li>Keep your hands clean and dry while handling the tablet.</li>
<li>Take the applicator out of the plastic wrap before using it.</li>
<li>Use the applicator only one time and then throw it away. Use a new applicator for each dose.</li>
<li>Most women will start by inserting a new tablet every day for two weeks, then change to inserting a new tablet only 2 days each week. Carefully follow the schedule that your health caregiver tells you to.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>Divigel®</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Open the packet and use the entire contents of a packet on the skin of either right or left upper thigh once a day.</li>
