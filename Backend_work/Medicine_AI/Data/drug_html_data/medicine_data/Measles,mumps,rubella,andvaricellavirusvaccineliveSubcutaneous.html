The combination vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases.</p><p>Measles (also known as coughing measles, hard measles, morbilli, red measles, rubeola, and 10-day measles) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Infection with measles can cause serious problems, such as stomach problems, pneumonia, ear infections, sinus problems, convulsions (seizures), brain damage, and possibly death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater for adults and infants than for children and teenagers.</p><p>Mumps is an infection that can cause serious problems, such as encephalitis and meningitis, which affect the brain. In addition, teenage boys and men are very susceptible to a condition, called orchitis, which causes pain and swelling in the testicles and scrotum, and in rare cases, sterility. Also, mumps infection can cause spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in women during the first 3 months of pregnancy.</p><p>Rubella (also known as German measles) is a serious infection that causes miscarriages, stillbirths, or birth defects in unborn babies when pregnant women get the disease.</p><p>Varicella (commonly known as chickenpox) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Chickenpox is usually a mild infection but can sometimes cause serious problems, such as pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and a rare disease, called Reye's syndrome.</p><p>Immunization against measles, mumps, german measles, and chickenpox is recommended for children 12 months to 12 years of age who have not had these diseases. Immunization against these diseases is not recommended for infants younger than 12 months of age and for children 13 years of age and older.</p><p>This vaccine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your child’s doctor or other authorized healthcare professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine live</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this vaccine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine live or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine in children 12 months to 12 years of age. However, this vaccine is not recommended for infants younger than 12 months of age and for children 13 years of age and older.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>This vaccine is not recommended for use in elderly patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving this vaccine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Receiving this vaccine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine live</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give your child this vaccine. It is given as a shot under your skin (usually in the upper arms or thighs).</p><p>Your child should receive one shot of the vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age and possibly a second shot at 4 to 6 years of age.</p><p>Your child may receive certain other vaccines at the same time as this one, but in a different body area.</p><p>You should receive a patient information sheet about all of the vaccines your child receives. Make sure you understand all of the information that is given to you.</p><p>It is important to receive this vaccine at the proper time. If your child misses a scheduled shot, call your child's doctor to make another appointment as soon as possible.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine live</h2><p><i>It is very important that your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time if your child needs a second dose of the vaccine</i>. Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects that occur after your child receive this vaccine.</p><p><i>Do not become pregnant for 3 months after receiving this vaccine without first checking with your doctor</i>. There is a chance that this vaccine may cause problems during pregnancy. If you think you have become pregnant, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Children who have received this vaccine have developed a fever and in some cases a fever with seizures. Talk with your child's doctor if you have concerns about this.</p><p>Your child should avoid close contact with people at high risk for catching the varicella virus for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. People who are at risk for catching the virus are pregnant women, newborn babies, and anyone who has a weak immune system that keeps them from fighting infections.</p><p>Tell your doctor that you have received this vaccine:</p><ul>
<li>If you are to receive blood transfusions or other blood products within 3 months of receiving this vaccine.</li>
<li>If you are to receive varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or other immune globulins within 3 to 5 months after receiving this vaccine.</li>
<li>If you are to have a tuberculin skin test within 4 to 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine.</li>
<li>If you are to receive any other live virus vaccines within 1 or 3 months of receiving this vaccine.</li>
</ul><p>Do not take aspirin or medicines that contain aspirin (such as cold medicines) for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. Carefully check the label of any pain, headache, or cold medicine you give to your child to be sure it does not contain aspirin or salicylic acid.</p><p>This vaccine contains albumin, which comes from human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses (eg, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from medicines made of human blood has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and testing during the manufacture of these medicines. Although the risk is low, talk with your child's doctor if you have concerns.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella virus vaccine live side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
