It deadens the nerve endings in the skin. Dibucaine does not cause unconsciousness as general anesthetics do when used for surgery.</p><p>Dibucaine is available without a prescription; however, your doctor may have special instructions on the proper use and dose for your medical problem.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using dibucaine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For dibucaine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to dibucaine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of dibucaine have not been performed in the pediatric population. However, pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of this medication in children are not expected.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of dibucaine in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of dibucaine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Infection at or near the place of application or</li>
<li>Large sores, broken skin, or severe injury at the area of application—The chance of side effects may be increased.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of dibucaine</h2><p><i>Use dibucaine exactly as directed by your doctor or as directed in the package instructions</i>. Do not use it for any other reason without first checking with your doctor. Dibucaine may cause unwanted effects if it is used too much, because more of it is absorbed into the body through the skin.</p><p>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using dibucaine.</p><p>Unless otherwise directed by your doctor, do not apply dibucaine to open wounds, burns, or broken or inflamed skin.</p><p>Dibucaine should be used only for problems being treated by your doctor or conditions listed in the package directions. <i>Check with your doctor before using it for other problems, especially if you think that an infection may be present</i>. Dibucaine should not be used to treat certain kinds of skin infections or serious problems, such as severe burns.</p><p>Be careful not to get any of dibucaine in your nose, mouth, and especially in your eyes, because it can cause severe eye irritation. If any of the medicine does get on these areas, wash the area with water for at least 15 minutes and check with your doctor right away.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of dibucaine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of dibucaine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
