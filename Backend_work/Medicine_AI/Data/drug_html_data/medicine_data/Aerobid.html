This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>Flunisolide belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing inflammation (swelling) in the lungs that causes an asthma attack.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Aerobid</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of inhaled flunisolide in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 4 years of age, and this medication is not indicated in children younger than 6 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of inhaled flunisolide have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving inhaled flunisolide.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Aerobid</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain flunisolide.  It may not be specific to Aerobid. Please read with care.</b></p><p>This medicine is used with a special inhaler and comes with patient information leaflet. Read the directions carefully before using this medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do.</p><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using this medicine without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it for more than 2 weeks, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Therefore, before using the inhaler, prime it by spraying the medicine two times into the air away from the face.</p><p>How to use this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>The inhaler contains a built-in spacer. Do not separate the purple actuator from the gray spacer. Do not use this medicine with other spacer or holding chamber devices.</li>
<li>Open and position the inhaler by pulling the built-in purple actuator out from the gray spacer and snap into an "L" shape before using it.</li>
<li>The first time you use the inhaler, or if you have not used the inhaler for 2 weeks or longer, prime the inhaler before use by shaking it well and then releasing a test spray away from your eyes and face. Press down on the metal canister two times for one second each in order to release 2 test sprays into the air.</li>
<li>To inhale this medicine, breathe out fully and try to get as much air out of your lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece just in front of your mouth with the canister upright. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.</li>
<li>While pressing down firmly and fully on the grey top of the inhaler, breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.</li>
<li>Hold your breath and remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. Continue holding your breath as long as you can up to 10 seconds before breathing out slowly. This gives the medicine time to settle in your airways and lungs.</li>
<li>After 10 seconds, breathe out and breathe normally.</li>
<li>If your doctor has prescribed 2 or more sprays at each use, wait for 20 seconds, and follow exactly the same steps you used for the first puff.</li>
<li>Snap the purple actuator back to the straight position and gently push it back into the gray spacer.</li>
<li>Gargle and rinse your mouth with water after each dose. You may also want to brush your teeth.</li>
</ul><p>Each inhaler comes with a Check-Off chart to track the number of puffs you have used. Mark off or check through each of your doses. Before you reach the last number of sprays, call your doctor to find out if you need a refill. You must discard the inhaler, actuator, and spacer after 60 sprays even if the canister is not empty. Do not place the canister under water to find out the amount of medicine still left in the canister.</p><p>If you are also taking oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) together with this medicine, you doctor may want to adjust your dose of prednisone. Ask your doctor first before changing your dose.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
