Fibrin sealant may also be used to prevent leaks from a wound left in stomach tissue after a colostomy is removed.</p><p>Artiss is sometimes used to help skin tissues stick together during skin graft procedures or cosmetic surgery.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not be treated with Artiss if you are allergic to cows or products made from cows.</p><p>Artiss is made from human plasma (part of the blood) and may contain infectious agents (e.g., viruses) that can cause disease. Although Artiss is screened, tested, and treated to reduce the possibility that it carries an infectious agent, it can still potentially transmit disease. Discuss with your doctor the risks and benefits of using Artiss.</p><p>Contact your doctor if you develop fever, drowsiness, chills, runny nose, rash, joint pain, poor appetite, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine, or yellowing of the skin or eyes following treatment with Artiss. These may be symptoms of infections that may occur due to use of this product.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Artiss if you are allergic to cows or products made from cows.</p><p>It is not known whether Artiss will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.</p><p>It is not known whether fibrin sealant topical passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Artiss?</h2><p>Artiss can be sprayed or dripped onto the affected skin or surgical area. This medicine is applied by a healthcare professional in a surgical or clinical setting.</p><p>Artiss is made from human plasma (part of the blood) which may contain viruses and other infectious agents. Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of it containing infectious agents, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication.</p><p>Some people develop symptoms of a viral infection after being treated with Artiss. <b>Call your doctor if you have flu-like symptoms</b> such as fever, chills, drowsiness, or a runny nose. You may also have joint pain and a skin rash about 2 weeks after the start of your flu symptoms.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Because you will receive Artiss in a clinical setting, you are not likely to miss a dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since this medicine is applied by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after being treated with Artiss?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Artiss side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Artiss</b>: hives, itching, warmth, redness, numbness, tingly feeling; nausea, vomiting, feeling light-headed, fast or slow heartbeats; wheezing, chest tightness, trouble breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Fibrin sealant is sometimes applied with a spray device that uses gas pressure. High pressure may cause the release of air or gas under the skin tissues, where it can then travel throughout the body. This may be more likely when high pressure settings are improperly used by a healthcare provider during the spray application of fibrin sealant. <b>Air or gas trapped within the body can cause serious or life-threatening effects.
