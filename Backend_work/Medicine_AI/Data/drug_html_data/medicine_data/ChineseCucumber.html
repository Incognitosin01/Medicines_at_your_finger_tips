Antiviral activity and potential application in cancer therapy is being investigated; however, a lack of clinical trials and toxicity of the plant’s root limit use.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>In traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese cucumber is most commonly administered as part of a polyherbal preparation. In a clinical trial in HIV patients, trichosanthin 1.2 mg intravenously (IV) weekly, then monthly, was used. In another study, the plant seeds (20 g of seed kernels per day for 28 days) were eaten as a dietary source of conjugated linolenic acid.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Pregnancy.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Extracts of the root possess abortifacient activity and are toxic to the fetus.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Available published clinical studies are limited. However, one trial reported myalgia, fever, elevated liver function tests, and mild to moderate anaphylactic reactions.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>Extracts of the Chinese cucumber are extremely toxic (death has occurred), particularly with parenteral use.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Cucurbitaceae (cucumber)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>The Chinese cucumber is one of more than 40 recognized species of Trichosanthes, including the snake or serpent gourd, Trichosanthes cucumerina. It  is a member of the gourd family, and the root, fruit, seeds, stems, and peel have been traditionally used. While T. kirilowii is the plant of this species most often referred to in <i>Chinese Materia Medica</i>, a number of related species are often used as adulterants.1, 2</p><h2>History</h2><p>T. kirilowii has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine and has been used to reduce fever, swelling, and cough. A starch extracted from the root is used for abscesses, amenorrhea, jaundice, and polyuria. Modern Chinese medicinal uses include the management of diabetes and use as an abortifacient. The plant has been used for centuries in the treatment of tumors.2, 3</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>The most studied component of T. kirilowii is the protein trichosanthin, which is found in the root of the plant. At least 2 ribosome-inactivating proteins, the trichosanthins, have been identified (sometimes referred to as "compound Q"), with T. kirilowii appearing to have the highest content. A highly purified form of trichosanthin has been investigated under the name GLQ-223. The trichosanthins possess abortifacient activity and are toxic to the fetus. The plant seeds contain hydroxylated sterols, fatty acids, and lignans.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Antiviral</h3><p>Studies in rats and guinea pigs demonstrated antiviral activity of trichosanthin.9 In vitro studies demonstrated activity against herpes simplex virus, HIV, and hepatitis B.10, 11 In vitro studies to determine potential applications are ongoing.12</p><p>Early interest in trichosanthin as an agent in HIV treatment appears to have lost momentum. The compound was reported to block HIV replication and destroy HIV-infected macrophages. A single clinical trial published findings on the addition of trichosanthin to standard therapy, which resulted in a median gain of 1.1 CD4+ cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/month.8</p><h3>Cancer</h3><p>Multiple in vitro studies have investigated both trichosanthin and cucurbitacin D using human cancer cell lines,13, 14, 15, 16 with much interest focusing on breast cancer.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 Other tumor cell lines used include hepatoma and lung tumor.23, 24, 25</p><p>In vivo animal studies included use in lung, nasopharyngeal, and cervical cancers, among others.26, 27, 28, 29</p><p>Trichosanthin was reported to have been used to treat choriocarcinoma and cervical cancer, but clinical studies are lacking.29</p><h3>Immune system</h3><p>In rodent and in vitro experiments, trichosanthin and cucurbitacin D demonstrated an inhibitory effect on lymphocytes, upregulation of CD4 T cells, and modulation of macrophages.30, 31, 32 In a study in mice, trichosanthin delayed allograft rejection.32 Anti-inflammatory effects of the related T. cucumerina against induced paw edema have also been demonstrated in rats.33</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of T. kirilowii for immune suppression, such as preventing graft-versus-host disease.</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>Antioxidant activity has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in rodents.34, 35, 36, 37</p><p>Extracts from the related T. cucumerina plant demonstrated antidiabetic and hypolipidemic activity in rats.38, 39</p><p>In rats, the seed oil is a source of linolenic acid,40 while in a clinical study, T. kirilowii seeds (20 g of seed kernels per day for 28 days) were eaten as a dietary source of conjugated linolenic acid.41</p><p>Extracts from the related T. cucumerina plant were gastroprotective in rats.42</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>In traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese cucumber is most commonly administered as part of a polyherbal preparation.</p><p>In a clinical trial in HIV patients, trichosanthin 1.2 mg IV weekly, then monthly, was used.8</p><p>In a clinical study, T. kirilowii seeds (20 g of seed kernels per day for 28 days) were eaten as a dietary source of conjugated linolenic acid.41</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Extracts of the root possess abortifacient activity and are toxic to the fetus. For this reason, trichosanthin has been used to resolve ectopic pregnancy in place of management via salpingectomy.43, 44</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Available published clinical studies are limited. However, one trial reported myalgia, fever, elevated liver function tests, and mild to moderate anaphylactic reactions.8 Allergy and sensitization to trichosanthin have been reported.2</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Extracts of the Chinese cucumber are extremely toxic, particularly if administered parenterally. Acute pulmonary edema, cerebral edema and hemorrhage, myocardosis, and death have been reported.2 Extracts of the root possess abortifacient activity and are toxic to the fetus.43</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Trichosanthes cucumerina</i></li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
