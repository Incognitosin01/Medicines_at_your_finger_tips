The first dose of Tacrolimus capsules should be given 8 - 12 hours after discontinuing the intravenous infusion.</p><p>The recommended starting dose of Tacrolimus injection is 0.03 - 0.05 mg/kg/day in kidney and liver transplant and 0.01 mg/kg/day in heart transplant given as a continuous intravenous infusion. Adult patients should receive doses at the lower end of the dosing range. Concomitant adrenal corticosteroid therapy is recommended early post-transplantation.</p><p>The whole blood trough concentration range described in Table 1 pertains to oral administration of Tacrolimus only; while monitoring Tacrolimus concentrations in patients receiving Tacrolimus injection as a continuous intravenous infusion may have some utility, the observed concentrations will not represent comparable exposures to those estimated by the trough concentrations  observed in patients  on oral therapy.</p><p>Anaphylactic reactions have occurred with injectables containing castor oil derivatives, such as Tacrolimus injection.

However, due to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Due to its potential for nephrotoxicity, consideration should be given to dosing Tacrolimus capsules at the lower end of the therapeutic dosing range in patients who have received a liver or heart transplant and have pre-existing renal impairment. Further reductions in dose below the targeted range may be required.</p><p>In kidney transplant patients with post-operative oliguria, the initial dose of Tacrolimus capsules should be administered no sooner than 6 hours and within 24 hours of transplantation, but may be delayed until renal function shows evidence of recovery <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Due to the reduced clearance and prolonged half-life, patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh ≥ 10) may require lower doses of Tacrolimus capsules. Close monitoring of blood concentrations is warranted.</p><p>The use of Tacrolimus capsules in liver transplant recipients experiencing post-transplant hepatic impairment may be associated with increased risk of developing renal insufficiency related to high whole blood concentrations of Tacrolimus. These patients should be monitored closely and dosage adjustments should be considered. Some evidence suggests that lower doses should be used in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Therapeutic Drug Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Monitoring of Tacrolimus blood concentrations in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters is considered an essential aid to patient management for the evaluation of rejection, toxicity, dose adjustments and compliance. Whole blood trough concentration range can be found in Table 1.</p><p>Factors influencing frequency of monitoring include but are not limited to hepatic or renal dysfunction, the addition or discontinuation of potentially interacting drugs and the post-transplant time. Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal and liver function monitoring and tissue biopsies. Data from clinical trials show that Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations were most variable during the first week  post-transplantation.</p><p>The relative risks of toxicity and efficacy failure are related to Tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Therefore, monitoring of whole blood trough concentrations is recommended to assist in the clinical evaluation of toxicity and efficacy failure.</p><p>Methods commonly used for the assay of Tacrolimus include high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC/MS/MS) and immunoassays. Immunoassays may react with metabolites as well as the parent compound. Therefore, assay results obtained with immunoassays may have a positive bias relative to results of HPLC/MS. The bias may depend upon the specific assay and laboratory. Comparison of the concentrations in published literature to patient concentrations using the current assays must be made with detailed knowledge of the assay methods and biological matrices employed. Whole blood is the matrix of choice and specimens should be collected into tubes containing ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant. Heparin anticoagulation is not recommended because of the tendency to form clots on storage. Samples which are not analyzed immediately should be stored at room temperature or in a refrigerator and assayed within 7 days; see assay instructions for specifics. If samples are to be kept longer, they should be deep frozen at -20° C. One study showed drug recovery &gt;90% for samples stored at -20°C for 6 months, with reduced recovery observed after 6 months.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Tacrolimus capsules are contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to Tacrolimus. Tacrolimus injection is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to HCO-60 (polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil). Hypersensitivity symptoms reported include dyspnea, rash, pruritus, and acute respiratory distress syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Lymphoma and Other Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Tacrolimus, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning].</span> The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.</p><p>As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, examine patients for skin changes; exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor.</p><p>Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein - Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. Monitor EBV serology during treatment.</p><h3>Serious Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including Tacrolimus, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Serious viral infections reported include:</p><p>• Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection</p><p>• JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)</p><p>• Cytomegalovirus infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor disease are at higher risk of developing CMV viremia and CMV disease.</p><p>Monitor for the development of infection and adjust the immunosuppressive regimen to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of infection <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span></p><h3>Not Interchangeable With Extended-Release Tacrolimus Products Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between Tacrolimus immediate-release products and Tacrolimus extended-release products were reported outside the U.S. This led to serious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, or other adverse reactions due to under-or overexposure to Tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is not interchangeable or substitutable for Tacrolimus extended-release products. Changes between Tacrolimus immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms must occur under physician supervision. Instruct patients and caregivers to recognize the appearance of Tacrolimus dosage forms <span class="Italics">[see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)]</span> and to confirm with the healthcare provider if a different product is dispensed.</p><h3>New Onset Diabetes After Transplant</h3><p class="First">Tacrolimus was shown to cause new onset diabetes mellitus in clinical trials of kidney, liver, and heart transplantation. New onset diabetes after transplantation may be reversible in some patients. African-American and Hispanic kidney transplant patients are at an increased risk. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using Tacrolimus <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Nephrotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Tacrolimus, like other calcineurin inhibitors, can cause acute or chronic nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity was reported in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Consider dosage reduction in patients with elevated serum creatinine and Tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than the recommended range. The risk for nephrotoxicity may increase when Tacrolimus is concomitantly administered with CYP3A inhibitors (by increasing Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations) or drugs associated with nephrotoxicity (e.g., aminoglycosides, ganciclovir, amphotericin B, cisplatin, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span> Monitor renal function and consider dosage reduction if nephrotoxicity occurs.</p><h3>Neurotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Tacrolimus may cause a spectrum of neurotoxicities. The most severe neurotoxicities include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), delirium, seizure and coma; others include tremors, paresthesias, headache, mental status changes, and changes in motor and sensory functions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>. As symptoms may be associated with Tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations at or above the recommended range, monitor for neurologic symptoms and consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of Tacrolimus if neurotoxicity occurs.</p><h3>Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First">Hyperkalemia has been reported with Tacrolimus use. Serum potassium levels should be monitored. Careful consideration should be given prior to use of other agents also associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) during Tacrolimus therapy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> Monitor serum potassium levels periodically during treatment.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">Hypertension is a common adverse effect of Tacrolimus therapy and may require antihypertensive therapy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> The control of blood pressure can be accomplished with any of the common antihypertensive agents, though careful consideration should be given prior to use of antihypertensive agents associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span> Calcium-channel blocking agents may increase Tacrolimus blood concentrations and therefore require dosage reduction of Tacrolimus <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span></p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions with Tacrolimus Injection</h3><p class="First">Anaphylactic reactions have occurred with injectables containing castor oil derivatives, including Tacrolimus, in a small percentage of patients (0.6%). The exact cause of these reactions is not known. Tacrolimus injection should be reserved for patients who are unable to take Tacrolimus orally. Monitor patients for anaphylaxis when using the intravenous route of administration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><h3>Not Recommended for Use with Sirolimus</h3><p class="First">Tacrolimus is not recommended for use with sirolimus:</p><p><span class="Bold">•</span> The use of sirolimus with Tacrolimus in studies of de novo liver transplant patients was associated with an excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) and is not recommended.</p><p>• The use of sirolimus (2 mg per day) with Tacrolimus in heart transplant patients in a U.S. trial was associated with increased risk of renal function impairment, wound healing complications, and insulin-dependent post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)].</span></p><h3>Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First">When co-administering Tacrolimus with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin) and strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin), adjustments in the dosing regimen of Tacrolimus and subsequent frequent monitoring of Tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations and Tacrolimus-associated adverse reactions are recommended <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Tacrolimus may prolong the QT/QTc interval and may cause <span class="Italics">Torsade de Pointes</span>. Avoid Tacrolimus in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. In patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, those taking certain antiarrhythmic medications or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation, and those with electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hypomagnesemia, consider obtaining electrocardiograms and monitoring electrolytes (magnesium, potassium, calcium) periodically during treatment.</p><p>When co-administering Tacrolimus with other substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 that also have the potential to prolong the QT interval, a reduction in Tacrolimus dose, frequent monitoring of Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations, and monitoring for QT prolongation is recommended. Use of  Tacrolimus  with amiodarone has been reported to result in increased Tacrolimus whole blood concentrations with or without concurrent QT prolongation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Myocardial Hypertrophy</h3><p class="First">Myocardial hypertrophy has been reported in infants, children, and adults, particularly those with high Tacrolimus trough concentrations, and is generally manifested by echocardiographically demonstrated concentric increases in left ventricular posterior wall and interventricular septum thickness. This condition appears reversible in most cases following dose reduction or discontinuance of therapy. In patients who develop renal failure or clinical manifestations of ventricular dysfunction while receiving Tacrolimus therapy, echocardiographic evaluation should be considered. If myocardial hypertrophy is diagnosed, dosage reduction or discontinuation of Tacrolimus should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Immunizations</h3><p class="First">Whenever possible, administer the complete complement of vaccines before transplantation and treatment with Tacrolimus.</p><p>The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Tacrolimus; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.</p><p>Inactivated vaccines noted to be safe for administration after transplantation may not be sufficiently immunogenic during treatment with Tacrolimus.</p><h3>Pure Red Cell Aplasia</h3><p class="First">Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with Tacrolimus. A mechanism for Tacrolimus-induced PRCA has not been elucidated. All patients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, underlying disease, or concomitant medications associated with PRCA. If PRCA is diagnosed, discontinuation of Tacrolimus should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious and otherwise important adverse drug reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Studies Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In addition, the clinical trials were not designed to establish comparative differences across study arms with regards to the adverse reactions discussed below.</p><p class="First">The incidence of adverse reactions was determined in three randomized kidney transplant trials. One of the trials used azathioprine (AZA) and corticosteroids and two of the trials used mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids concomitantly for maintenance immunosuppression.</p><p>Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids following kidney transplantation was assessed in a trial where 205 patients received Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression and 207 patients received cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. The trial population had a mean age of 43 years (mean ± SD was 43 ± 13 years on Tacrolimus and 44 ± 12 years on cyclosporine arm), the distribution was 61% male, and the composition was White (58%), African-American (25%), Hispanic (12%), and Other (5%). The 12-month post-transplant information from this trial is presented below.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (≥ 30%) observed in Tacrolimus-treated kidney transplant patients are: infection, tremor, hypertension, abnormal renal function, constipation, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, insomnia, nausea, hypomagnesemia, urinary tract infection, hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema, asthenia, pain, hyperlipidemia, hyperkalemia, and anemia. Based on reported adverse reaction terms related to decreased renal function, nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 52% of kidney transplantation patients.</p><p>Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 15% of kidney transplant patients treated with Tacrolimus in conjunction with azathioprine are presented below:</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4.

In the U.S. trial, 263 adult and pediatric patients received Tacrolimus and steroids and 266 patients received cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen (CsA/AZA). The trial population had a mean age of 44 years (range 0.4 to 70); the distribution was 52% male, and the composition was White (78%), African-American (5%), Asian (2%), Hispanic (13%), and Other (2%). In the European trial, 270 patients received Tacrolimus and steroids and 275 patients received CsA/AZA. The trial population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 68); the distribution was 59% male, and the composition was White (95.4%), Black (1%), Asian (2%), and Other (2%).</p><p>The proportion of patients reporting more than one adverse event was &gt; 99% in both the Tacrolimus group and the CsA/AZA group. Precautions must be taken when comparing the incidence of adverse reactions in the U.S. trial to that in the European trial. The 12-month post-transplant information from the U.S. trial and from the European trial is presented below. The two trials also included different patient populations and patients were treated with immunosuppressive regimens of differing intensities. Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 15% in Tacrolimus patients (combined trial results) are presented below for the two controlled trials in liver transplantation.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (≥ 38%) observed in Tacrolimus-treated liver transplant patients are: tremor, headache, diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, abnormal renal function, abdominal pain, insomnia, paresthesia, anemia, pain, fever, asthenia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperglycemia. These all occur with oral and IV administration of Tacrolimus and some may respond to a reduction in dosing (e.g., tremor, headache, paresthesia, hypertension). Diarrhea was sometimes associated with other gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea and vomiting. Based on reported adverse reaction terms related to decreased renal function, nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 40% and 36% of liver transplantation patients receiving Tacrolimus in the U.S. and European randomized trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 7.

Effects on parturition (incomplete delivery of nonviable pups) were observed at 1 mg/kg (0.8 to 2.2 times the recommended clinical dose range) [<span class="Italics">see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>].</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Controlled lactation studies have not been conducted in humans; however, Tacrolimus has been reported to be present in human milk. The effects of Tacrolimus on the breastfed infant, or on milk production have not been assessed. Tacrolimus is excreted in rat milk and in peri-/postnatal rat studies; exposure to Tacrolimus during the postnatal period was associated with developmental toxicity in the offspring at clinically relevant doses [<span class="Italics">see Pregnancy (8.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>].</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tacrolimus and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tacrolimus or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p>Tacrolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise female and male patients of reproductive potential to speak to their healthcare provider on family planning options including appropriate contraception prior to starting treatment with Tacrolimus [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Based on findings in animals, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with Tacrolimus [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric liver transplant patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver transplant</span></p><p>Safety and efficacy in pediatric liver transplant patients less than 16 years of age are based on evidence from active controlled studies that included 56 pediatric patients, 31 of which received Tacrolimus. Additionally, 122 pediatric patients were studied in an uncontrolled trial of Tacrolimus in living related donor liver transplantation. Pediatric patients generally required higher doses of Tacrolimus to maintain blood trough concentrations of Tacrolimus similar to adult patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><p>Additional pediatric use information is approved for Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s Prograf (Tacrolimus) products. However, due to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of Tacrolimus did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus in patients with renal impairment was similar to that in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. However, consideration should be given to dosing Tacrolimus at the lower end of the therapeutic dosing range in patients who have received a liver or heart transplant and have pre-existing renal impairment. Further reductions in dose below the targeted range may be required <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The mean clearance of Tacrolimus was substantially lower in patients with severe hepatic impairment (mean Child-Pugh score: &gt;10) compared to healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. Close monitoring of Tacrolimus trough concentrations is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>The use of Tacrolimus in liver transplant recipients experiencing post-transplant hepatic impairment may be associated with increased risk of developing renal insufficiency related to high whole-blood trough concentrations of Tacrolimus. These patients should be monitored closely and dosage adjustments should be considered. Some evidence suggests that lower doses should be used in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Race or Ethnicity</h3><p class="First">African-American patients may need to be titrated to higher dosages to attain comparable trough concentrations compared to Caucasian patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>African-American and Hispanic patients are at increased risk for new onset diabetes after transplant. Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat appropriately <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Limited overdosage experience is available. Acute overdosages of up to 30 times the intended dose have been reported. Almost all cases have been asymptomatic and all patients recovered with no sequelae. Acute overdosage was sometimes followed by adverse reactions consistent with those listed in <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span> (including tremors, abnormal renal function, hypertension, and peripheral edema); in one case of acute overdosage, transient urticaria and lethargy were observed. Based on the poor aqueous solubility and extensive erythrocyte and plasma protein binding, it is anticipated that Tacrolimus is not dialyzable to any significant extent; there is no experience with charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral use of activated charcoal has been reported in treating acute overdoses, but experience has not been sufficient to warrant recommending its use. General supportive measures and treatment of specific symptoms should be followed in all cases of overdosage.</p><p>In acute oral and IV toxicity studies, mortalities were seen at or above the following doses: in adult rats, 52 times the recommended human oral dose; in immature rats, 16 times the recommended oral dose; and in adult rats, 16 times the recommended human IV dose (all based on body surface area corrections).</p><h2>Tacrolimus Description</h2><p class="First">Tacrolimus, previously known as FK506, is the active ingredient in Tacrolimus capsules.

Inactive ingredients include croscarmellose sodium NF, hypromellose USP, lactose monohydrate NF, and magnesium stearate NF. The 0.5 mg capsule shell contains, FD &amp; C Blue 1, FD &amp; C Red 40, gelatin NF and titanium dioxide USP, the 1 mg capsule shell contains FD &amp; C Blue 1, gelatin NF, iron oxide yellow and titanium dioxide USP, and the 5 mg capsule shell contains D &amp; C Red 28, D &amp; C Yellow 10, FD &amp; C Blue 1, gelatin NF, and titanium dioxide USP.</p><h2>Tacrolimus - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of Tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin (a ubiquitous mammalian intracellular enzyme) is then formed, after which the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. Such inhibition prevents the dephosphorylation and translocation of various factors such as the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB).</p><p>Tacrolimus inhibits the expression and/or production of several cytokines that include interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Tacrolimus also inhibits IL-2 receptor expression and nitric oxide release, induces apoptosis and production of transforming growth factor beta that can lead to immunosuppressive activity. The net result is the inhibition of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, as well as T-helper-cell-dependent B-cell response (i.e., immunosuppression).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Tacrolimus activity is primarily due to the parent drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters (mean ± S.D.) of Tacrolimus have been determined following intravenous (IV) and/or oral (PO) administration in healthy volunteers, and in kidney transplant, liver transplant, and heart transplant patients (Table 17).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 17.

The active control groups were treated with a cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen (CsA/AZA). Both trials used concomitant adrenal corticosteroids as part of the immunosuppressive regimens. These trials compared patient and graft survival rates at 12 months following transplantation.</p><p>In one trial, 529 patients were enrolled at 12 clinical sites in the United States; prior to surgery, 263 were randomized to the Tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen and 266 to the CsA/AZA. In 10 of the 12 sites, the same CsA/AZA protocol was used, while 2 sites used different control protocols. This trial excluded patients with renal dysfunction, fulminant hepatic failure with Stage IV encephalopathy, and cancers; pediatric patients (≤ 12 years old) were allowed. In the second trial, 545 patients were enrolled at 8 clinical sites in Europe; prior to surgery, 270 were randomized to the Tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen and 275 to CsA/AZA. In this trial, each center used its local standard CsA/AZA protocol in the active-control arm. This trial excluded pediatric patients, but did allow enrollment of subjects with renal dysfunction, fulminant hepatic failure in Stage IV encephalopathy, and cancers other than primary hepatic with metastases.</p><p>One-year patient survival and graft survival in the Tacrolimus-based treatment groups were similar to those in the CsA/AZA treatment groups in both trials. The overall 1-year patient survival (CsA/AZA and Tacrolimus-based treatment groups combined) was 88% in the U.S. trial and 78% in the European trial. The overall 1-year graft survival (CsA/AZA and Tacrolimus -based treatment groups combined) was 81% in the U.S. trial and 73% in the European trial. In both trials, the median time to convert from IV to oral Tacrolimus dosing was 2 days.</p><p>Although there is a lack of direct correlation between Tacrolimus concentrations and drug efficacy, data from clinical trials of liver transplant patients have shown an increasing incidence of adverse reactions with increasing trough blood concentrations. Most patients are stable when trough whole blood concentrations are maintained between 5 to 20 ng/mL. Long-term post-transplant patients are often maintained at the low end of this target range. Data from the U.S. clinical trial show that the median trough blood concentrations, measured at intervals from the second week to one year post-transplantation, ranged from 9.8 ng/mL to 19.4 ng/mL.</p><p>Additional pediatric use information is approved for Astellas Pharma US, Inc.'s Prograf (Tacrolimus) products.

In a trial conducted in Europe, 314 patients received a regimen of antibody induction, corticosteroids, and azathioprine in combination with Tacrolimus or cyclosporine modified for 18 months. In a 3-arm trial conducted in the U.S., 331 patients received corticosteroids and Tacrolimus plus sirolimus, Tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or cyclosporine modified plus MMF for 1 year.</p><p>In the European trial, patient/graft survival at 18 months post-transplant was similar between treatment arms, 92% in the Tacrolimus group and 90% in the cyclosporine group. In the U.S. trial, patient and graft survival at 12 months was similar with 93% survival in the Tacrolimus plus MMF group and 86% survival in the cyclosporine modified plus MMF group. In the European trial, the cyclosporine trough concentrations were above the pre-defined target range (i.e., 100 to 200 ng/mL) at Day 122 and beyond in 32%  to 68% of the patients in the cyclosporine treatment arm, whereas the Tacrolimus trough concentrations were within the pre-defined target range (i.e., 5 to 15 ng/mL) in 74% to 86% of the patients in the Tacrolimus treatment arm. Data from this European trial indicate that from 1 week to 3 months post-transplant, approximately 80% of patients maintained trough concentrations between 8 to 20 ng/mL and, from 3 months through 18 months post-transplant, approximately 80% of patients maintained trough concentrations between 6 to18 ng/mL.</p><p>The U.S. trial contained a third arm of a combination regimen of sirolimus, 2 mg per day, and full-dose Tacrolimus; however, this regimen was associated with increased risk of wound-healing complications, renal function impairment, and insulin-dependent post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
