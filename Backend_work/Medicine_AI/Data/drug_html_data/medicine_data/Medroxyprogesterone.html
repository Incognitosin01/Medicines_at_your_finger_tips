Medroxyprogesterone is also used to decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia (a condition that may lead to uterine cancer) while taking estrogens.</p><p>Medroxyprogesterone is also used to prevent overgrowth in the lining of the uterus in postmenopausal women who are receiving estrogen hormone replacement therapy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use medroxyprogesterone if you are pregnant, or if you have liver disease, a hormone-related cancer such as breast or uterine cancer, a history of stroke or blood clot, or abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been checked by a doctor.</p><p>Medroxyprogesterone should not be used to prevent heart disease, stroke, or dementia. This medicine may actually increase your risk of developing these conditions. Long-term use of medroxyprogesterone may increase your risk of breast cancer, heart attack, stroke, or blood clot. Talk with your doctor about your individual risk.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Medroxyprogesterone can cause birth defects. <b>Do not use if this medicine you are pregnant.</b> Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant during treatment.</p><p>You should not use this medicine if you are allergic to medroxyprogesterone, or if you have:</p><ul>

<p>a hormone-related cancer such as breast or uterine cancer;</p>

To help lower this risk, your doctor may prescribe a progestin for you to take with medroxyprogesterone. Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away.</p><p>Medroxyprogesterone can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Medroxyprogesterone <b>will not</b> prevent heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia, and may actually increase the risk of developing these conditions in post-menopausal women. Medroxyprogesterone may also increase the risk of uterine or ovarian cancer in some women. Long-term treatment with estrogens and progestins (such as medroxyprogesterone) may also increase your risk of heart attack, blood clot, or stroke.</p><p>Talk to your doctor about your specific risks and benefits of taking this medicine, especially if you smoke or are overweight. Your doctor should check your progress on a regular basis (every 3 to 6 months) to determine whether you should continue this treatment.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take medroxyprogesterone?</h2><p>Take medroxyprogesterone exactly as prescribed by your doctor.
