It has been established that ingestion of fluoridated drinking water (1 ppm F) during the period of tooth development results in significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries.1 Sodium Fluoride Drops were developed to provide systemic Fluoride for use as a supplement</p><p>in pediatric patients from 6 months to age 3 and older, living in areas where the drinking water Fluoride level does not exceed 0.6 ppm F.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not use in areas where drinking water exceeds 0.6 ppm F. Do not administer to pediatric patients less than 6 months old.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Prolonged daily ingestion of quantities greater than the recommended amount may result in various degrees of dental fluorosis in pediatric patients under age 6 years, especially if the water fluoridation exceeds 0.6 ppm. Read directions carefully before using. Keep out of the reach of infants and children.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">See " Overdosage" section. Incompatibility of Fluoride with dairy foods has been reported due to formation of Calcium Fluoride which is poorly absorbed. Not for use in the eyes.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported.</p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or Method Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 877-250-3427.</p><p><span class="Bold">Store at controlled room temperature 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F).</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Prolonged daily ingestion of excessive Fluoride may result in varying degrees of dental fluorosis. The total amount of Sodium Fluoride in a bottle of 50 mL (0.5 mg/mL) Sodium Fluoride Drops (25 mg F) conforms with the recommendations of the American Dental Association for the maximum to be dispensed at one time for safety purposes. If overdose is suspected, call 1-800-222-1222 (American Association of Poison Control Centers), your local poison control center (www.aapcc.org), or emergency room immediately for treatment recommendations.</p><h2>Dosages and Administration</h2><p class="First">Daily oral dose: (in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm F) age 6 months to 3 years: one half dropperful (1/2 mL); age 3 to 6 years, one dropperful (1 mL); age 6 to 16 years, two dropperfuls (2 mL). When drinking water is partially fluoridated (0.3 to 0.6 ppm F inclusive) dose as follows: age 6 months to 3 years, Fluoride supplementation not indicated; age 3 to 6 years, one half dropperful (1/2 mL); age 6 to 16 years, one dropperful (1 mL).</p><h2>How Supplied</h2><p class="First">50 mL bottles (58657-322-50)</p><h2>References</h2><p class="First">1.
