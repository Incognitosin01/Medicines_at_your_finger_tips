</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Navane</h2><p>The family of medicines known as thioxanthenes are used in the treatment of nervous, mental, and emotional conditions. Improvement in such conditions is thought to result from the effect of these medicines on nerve pathways in specific areas of the brain.</p><p>Thioxanthene medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Navane</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Certain side effects, such as muscle spasms of the face, neck, and back, tic-like or twitching movements, inability to move the eyes, twisting of the body, or weakness of the arms and legs, are more likely to occur in children, who are usually more sensitive than adults to the side effects of thioxanthenes.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Constipation, dizziness or fainting, drowsiness, dryness of mouth, trembling of the hands and fingers, and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (such as rapid, worm-like movements of the tongue or any other uncontrolled movements of the mouth, tongue, or jaw, and/or arms and legs) are especially likely to occur in elderly patients, who are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of thioxanthenes.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Studies have not been done in pregnant women. Although animal studies have not shown that thioxanthenes cause birth defects, the studies have shown that these medicines cause a decrease in fertility and fewer successful pregnancies.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>It is not known if thioxanthenes pass into the breast milk. However, similar medicines for nervous, mental, or emotional conditions do pass into breast milk and may cause drowsiness and increase the risk of other problems in the nursing baby. Be sure you have discussed the risks and benefits of this medicine with your doctor.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any such depressants while you are using this medicine</i>.</p><p>Do not take this medicine within an hour of taking antacids or medicine for diarrhea. Taking them too close together may make this medicine less effective.</p><p><i>Before having any kind of surgery, dental treatment, or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are using this medicine</i>. Taking thioxanthenes together with medicines that are used during surgery or dental or emergency treatments may increase the CNS depressant effects.</p><p>This medicine may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally, especially during the first few weeks the medicine is being taken. Even if you take this medicine only at bedtime, you may feel drowsy or less alert on arising. <i>Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert</i>.</p><p><i>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur while you are taking this medicine</i>, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>This medicine may make you sweat less, causing your body temperature to increase. <i>Use extra care not to become overheated during exercise or hot weather while you are taking this medicine</i>, since overheating may result in heat stroke. Also, hot baths or saunas may make you feel dizzy or faint while you are taking this medicine.</p><p>Thioxanthenes may cause your skin to be more sensitive to sunlight than it is normally. Exposure to sunlight, even for brief periods of time, may cause a skin rash, itching, redness or other discoloration of the skin, or a severe sunburn. When you begin taking this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>Stay out of direct sunlight, especially between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., if possible.</li>
<li>Wear protective clothing, including a hat. Also, wear sunglasses.</li>
<li>Apply a sun block product that has a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Some patients may require a product with a higher SPF number, especially if they have a fair complexion. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.</li>
<li>Apply a sun block lipstick that has an SPF of at least 15 to protect your lips.</li>
<li>Do not use a sunlamp or tanning bed or booth.</li>
</ul><p><i>If you have a severe reaction from the sun, check with your doctor</i>.</p><p>This medicine may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless gum or candy, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if your mouth continues to feel dry for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.</p><p>If you are taking a liquid form of this medicine, <i>try to avoid spilling it on your skin or clothing</i>. Skin rash and irritation have been caused by similar medicines.</p><p>If you are receiving this medicine by injection:</p><ul>
