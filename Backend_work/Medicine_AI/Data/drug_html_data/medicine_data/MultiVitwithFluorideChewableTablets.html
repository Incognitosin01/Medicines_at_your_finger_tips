Because the tablets are chewable, they provide a <span class="Italics">topical</span> as well as <span class="Italics">systemic</span> source of fluoride.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the <span class="Italics">hydroxyapatite</span> in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, <span class="Italics">fluorapatite</span>. The reaction may be expressed by the equation:</p><p>Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:</p><h2>Indications and Usage for MultiVit with Fluoride Chewable Tablets</h2><p class="First">Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins.</p><p>Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis.</p><p>Multivitamin with 1 mg Fluoride Chewable Tablets provide fluoride in tablet form for children 6-16 years of age in areas where the water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm.</p><p>Multivitamin with 0.5 mg Fluoride Chewable Tablets provide fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6 years of age where the water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm, and for children 6 years of age and above where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride.</p><p>Multivitamin with 0.25 mg Fluoride Chewable Tablets provide fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6 years of age where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride.</p><p>Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation.</p><p>Children using Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">As in the case of all medications, keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose of Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets <span class="Italics">should not be exceeded</span>, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride.</p><p>Before prescribing Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets:</p><p>Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of medication administration.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported.</p><h2>MultiVit with Fluoride Chewable Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">One tablet daily or as prescribed.</p><h2>How is MultiVit with Fluoride Chewable Tablets Supplied</h2><p class="First">Multi-vitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets Grape are available as follows:</p><ul class="Disk">
