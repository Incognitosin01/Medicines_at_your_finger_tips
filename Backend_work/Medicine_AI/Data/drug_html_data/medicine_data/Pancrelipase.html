These enzymes are normally produced by the pancreas and are important in the digestion of fats, proteins, and sugars.</p><p>Pancrelipase is used to replace these enzymes when the body does not have enough of its own. Certain medical conditions can cause this lack of enzymes, including cystic fibrosis, chronic inflammation of the pancreas, or blockage of the pancreatic ducts.</p><p>Pancrelipase may also be used following surgical removal of the pancreas.</p><p>Pancrelipase may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not take pancrelipase if you are allergic to pork proteins.</p><p><b>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of a rare but serious bowel disorder:</b> severe or unusual stomach pain, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take pancrelipase if you are allergic to pork proteins.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
