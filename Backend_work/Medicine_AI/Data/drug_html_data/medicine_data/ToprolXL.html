It is not known whether metoprolol succinate will harm an unborn baby. However, having high blood pressure during pregnancy may cause complications such as diabetes or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating hypertension may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p><b>Ask a doctor before using Toprol-XL if you are breast-feeding.</b> Metoprolol succinate can pass into breast milk and may cause dry skin, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, or slow heartbeats in your baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="directions">How should I take Toprol-XL?</h2><p>Take Toprol-XL exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.
