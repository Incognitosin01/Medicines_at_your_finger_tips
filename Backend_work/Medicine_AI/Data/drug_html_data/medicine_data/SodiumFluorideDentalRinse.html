</ul><h2>Sodium Fluoride Dental Rinse Description</h2><p class="First">Neutral Sodium Fluoride 0.2% Dental Rinse is a mint-flavored, neutral, aqueous solution containing 6% alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Active ingredient:</span> Sodium Fluoride 0.2% (w/v).  Contains: FD and C Blue #1.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Inactive ingredients:</span> Purified water, Glycerin, Alcohol 6% (v/v), Xylitol, Sodium Benzoate, Flavor, Magna Sweet, FD and C Blue #1.<br/></p><h2>Sodium Fluoride Dental Rinse - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h2>Indications and Usage for Sodium Fluoride Dental Rinse</h2><p class="First">A dental caries preventative for weekly self-applied topical use.  Weekly rinsing with a neutral 0.2% sodium fluoride solution protects against dental caries in pediatric patients.  Neutral Sodium Fluoride 0.2% Dental Rinse provides a ready- to-use preparation for convenient administration and favorable compliance.  May be used in areas where drinking water is fluoridated since topical fluoride cannot produce fluorosis.  (See WARNINGS for exception.)</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Keep out of reach of infants and children.  Pediatric patients under age 12 should be supervised in the use of this product.  Patients under age 6 require special supervision to prevent repeated swallowing of rinse since they frequently swallow significant amounts while rinsing.  Prolonged daily ingestion may result in dental fluorosis in patients under age 6, especially if water fluoridation exceeds 0.6 ppm.  Read directions carefully before using.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> Not for systemic treatment.  DO NOT SWALLOW.</p><h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h2><p class="First">No carcinogenesis was found in mice or female  rats treated with fluoride at doses ranging from 4.1 to 9.1 mg/kg of body weight.  Equivocal  evidence of carcinogenesis was reported in rats treated with 2.5 and 4.1 mg/kg of body weight.  In another study, no carcinogenesis was observed in rats treated with fluoride up to 11.3 mg/kg of body weight.  Epidemiological data provide no credible evidence for an association between fluoride, either naturally occurring or added to drinking water, and risk of human cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Fluoride ion is not mutagenic in standard bacterial systems but has been associated with chromosome aberrations in cultured human and rodent cells at doses much higher than expected human exposures.  Some in vivo studies report chromosome damage in rodents while other studies using similar protocols report negative results.<br/>
<br/>
Potential adverse reproductive effects of fluoride exposure in humans has not been adequately evaluated.  Adverse effects on reproduction were reported for rats, mice, fox, and cattle exposed to 100 ppm or greater concentrations of fluoride in their diet or drinking water.  Other studies conducted in rats demonstrated that lower concentrations of fluoride (5 mg/kg of body weight) did not result in impaired fertility and reproductive capabilities.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>Pregnancy</h2><p class="First">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B.  It has been shown that fluoride crosses the placenta of rats, but only 0.01% of the amount administered is incorporated in fetal tissue.  Animal studies (rats, mice, rabbits) have shown that fluoride is not a teratogen.  Maternal exposure to 12.2 mg fluoride/kg of body weight (rats) or 13.1 mg/kg of body weight (rabbits) did not affect litter size or fetal weight and did not increase frequency of skeletal or visceral malformations.  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  However, epidemiological studies conducted in areas with high levels of naturally fluoridated water showed no increase in birth defects.  Heavy exposure to fluoride during in utero development may result in skeletal fluorosis which becomes evident in childhood.</p><h2>Nursing Mothers</h2><p class="First">It is not known if fluoride is excreted in human milk.  However, many drugs are excreted in milk and caution should be exercised when products containing fluoride are administered to a nursing woman.  Reduced milk production was reported in farm-raised fox when the animals were fed a diet containing a high concentration of fluoride (98-137 mg/kg of body weight).  No adverse effects on parturition, lactation, or offspring were seen in rats administered fluoride up to 5 mg/kg of body weight.</p><h2>Pediatric Use</h2><p class="First">The use of Neutral Sodium Fluoride 0.2% Dental Rinse as a weekly caries preventative in pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years is supported by adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in students aged 6 to 12 years.1-3 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the ages of 6 years have not been established.  Please refer to the CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.</p><h2>Geriatric Use</h2><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of 1.1% (w/v) sodium fluoride, 15 percent were 65 and over, while 1 percent were 75 and over.  No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.  This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.  Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.<br/></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In patients with mucositis, gingival tissues may be hypersensitive to flavor or alcohol present in formulation.  Allergic reactions and other idiosyncrasies are rarely reported.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h2>Sodium Fluoride Dental Rinse Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">For caries- Adults and pediatric patients over age 6 years, 2 teaspoonfuls (10mL) once a week, preferably at bedtime after thoroughly brushing teeth, rinse vigorously around and between teeth for one minute, then expectorate.  DO NOT SWALLOW.  For maximum benefit, do not eat, drink, or rinse mouth for at least 30 minutes afterwards.</p><h2>How is Sodium Fluoride Dental Rinse Supplied</h2><p class="First">Plastic bottle with child-resistant closure containing 16 fl oz (473 mL) (NDC 60258-158-16).</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at Controlled Room Temperature, 20-25<span class="Sup">o</span>C (68-77<span class="Sup">o</span>F).</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>More about fluoride topical</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
