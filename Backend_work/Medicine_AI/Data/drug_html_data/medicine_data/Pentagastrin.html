</ul><h2>Pentagastrin - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The exact mechanism by which Pentagastrin stimulates gastric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor secretion is unknown; however, since Pentagastrin is an analogue of natural gastrin, it is believed that it excites the oxyntic cells of the stomach to secrete to their maximum capacity. Pentagastrin stimulates pancreatic secretion, especially when administered in large intramuscular doses. Pentagastrin also increases gastrointestinal motility by a direct effect on the intestinal smooth muscle. However, it delays gastric emptying time probably by stimulation of terminal antral contractions, which enhance retropulsion.</p><p><span class="Bold">OTHER ACTIONS/EFFECTS</span> Pentagastrin increases blood flow in the gastric mucosa, inhibits absorption of water and electrolytes from the ileum, and promotes sodium and chloride diuresis. It causes contraction of the smooth muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter when administered intravenously. Pentagastrin produces an increase in the motor activity of the colon and rectum</p><p><span class="Bold">ONSET OF ACTION</span> 10 minutes</p><p><span class="Bold">TIME TO PEAK EFFECT</span> 20 to 30 minutes</p><p><span class="Bold">DURATION OF ACTION</span> 60 to 80 minutes</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Pentagastrin</h2><h2>Pentagastrin Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The intravenous infusion dose has ranged from 0.1 to 12 mcg (0.0001 to 0.012 mg) per kg of body weight per hour administered in a 0.9% sodium chloride injection.
