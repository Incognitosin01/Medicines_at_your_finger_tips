High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if the blood pressure is controlled.</p><p>Chlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps to lower blood pressure and remove excess fluid (edema).</p><p>Chlorothiazide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using chlorothiazide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For chlorothiazide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to chlorothiazide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of chlorothiazide have not been performed in the pediatric population. However, pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of chlorothiazide in children are not expected, and no problems have been documented to date.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of chlorothiazide in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving chlorothiazide.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies suggest that this medication may alter milk production or composition. If an alternative to this medication is not prescribed, you should monitor the infant for side effects and adequate milk intake.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking chlorothiazide, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using chlorothiazide with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

</ul><p>Using chlorothiazide with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you.

<li>Aminolevulinic Acid</li>
<li>Calcium</li>
<li>Ginkgo</li>
<li>Gossypol</li>

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of chlorothiazide. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Anuria (not able to form urine)—Should not be used in patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Asthma or</li>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Gout or</li>
<li>Hypercalcemia (high calcium in the blood) or</li>
<li>Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol in the blood) or</li>

<li>Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium in the blood) or</li>
<li>Hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood) or</li>
<li>Liver disease or</li>
<li>Systemic lupus erythematosus—Use with caution. Chlorothiazide may make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease—Use with caution. The effects of the medicine may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of chlorothiazide</h2><p>In addition to the use of chlorothiazide, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and changes in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium or potassium. Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.</p><p>Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many patients feel normal. It is very important that you <i>take your medicine exactly as directed</i> and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.</p><p>Chlorothiazide will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. You must continue to receive it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. <i>You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life.</i> If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems, such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of chlorothiazide will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of chlorothiazide. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
