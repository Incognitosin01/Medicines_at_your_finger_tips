</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Potential for Abuse and Dependence</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)].</span></p><h3>Serious Cardiovascular Reactions</h3><p class="First">Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses. Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD. Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or arrhythmias during Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules treatment.</p><h3>Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 bpm). Individuals may have larger increases. Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia.</p><h3>Psychiatric Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Psychosis</span></p><p>CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder</span></p><p>CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms</span></p><p>CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared to 0 in placebo-treated patients.</p><h3>Priapism</h3><p class="First">Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate products, in both pediatric and adult patients. Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug, often subsequent to an increase in dose. Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention.</p><h3>Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants, including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.</p><h3>Long-Term Suppression of Growth</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated pediatric patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants, including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules. Patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychostimulants at 1-866-961-2388.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published studies report on the use of methylphenidate in pregnant women; however, the data are insufficient to inform any drug-associated risks. No effects on morphological development were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10 and 15 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. However, spina bifida was observed in rabbits at a dose 52 times the MRHD given to adolescents. A decrease in pup body weight was observed in a pre- and post-natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at the highest dose of 60 mg/kg/day (6 times the MRHD given to adolescents) <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span> The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions</span></p><p>CNS stimulants, such as Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. No fetal and/or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy; however, premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine-dependent mothers.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In embryo-fetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 75 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. Malformations (increased incidence of fetal spina bifida) were observed in rabbits at the highest dose, which is approximately 52 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rabbits was 60 mg/kg/day (15 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). There was no evidence of morphological development effects in rats, although increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen at the highest dose level (10 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), which was also maternally toxic. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rats was 25 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). When methylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 45 mg/kg/day, offspring body weight gain was decreased at the highest dose (6 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis), but no other effects on postnatal development were observed. The no effect level for pre- and postnatal development in rats was 15 mg/kg/day (1.5 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published literature, based on breast milk sampling from five mothers, reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. However, long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as agitation, anorexia, and reduced weight gain.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules in pediatric patients under 6 years have not been established.</p><p>Safety and efficacy of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules were evaluated in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study in 119 children 4 to &lt;6 years of age with ADHD followed by a 12-month open-label extension in 44 of these children. In these studies, patients experienced high rates of adverse reactions, most notably weight loss. Comparing weights prior to initiation of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules (in the safety and efficacy study) to weights after 12 months of treatment (in the open-label extension), 20 of 39 patients with data (50%) had lost enough weight to decrease 10 or more percentiles on a Centers for Disease Control growth chart for weight. In addition, systemic drug exposures in patients 4 to &lt;6 years of age were higher than those observed in older children and adolescents at the same dose (2 to 3 fold higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC). Therefore, the benefits of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules do not outweigh the risks in pediatric patients 4 to &lt;6 years of age.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules have been established in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. The long-term efficacy of methylphenidate in pediatric patients has not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Long Term Suppression of Growth</span></p><p>Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span></p><p>Rats treated with methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. A deficit in acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 6 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In the study conducted in young rats, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal weeks 13-14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) or greater, and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females exposed to the highest dose (8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). The clinical significance of the long-term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules did not include any patients aged 65 years and over. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient start at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules contains methylphenidate a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">CNS stimulants including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, other methylphenidate-containing products, and amphetamines have a high potential for abuse. Abuse is characterized by impaired control over drug use despite harm, and craving.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of CNS stimulant abuse include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and/or sweating, dilated pupils, hyperactivity, restlessness, insomnia, decreased appetite, loss of coordination, tremors, flushed skin, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed. Abusers of CNS stimulants may chew, snort, inject, or use other unapproved routes of administration which can result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><p>To reduce the abuse of CNS stimulants including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, keep careful prescription records, educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal of CNS stimulants, monitor for signs of abuse while on therapy, and re-evaluate the need for Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules use.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tolerance</span></p><p>Tolerance (a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug results in a reduction of the drug's desired and/or undesired effects over time) can occur during chronic therapy with CNS stimulants including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dependence</span></p><p>Physical dependence (a state of adaptation manifested by a withdrawal syndrome produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, or administration of an antagonist) can occur in patients treated with CNS stimulants including Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules. Withdrawal symptoms after abrupt cessation following prolonged high-dosage administration of CNS stimulants include extreme fatigue and depression.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Signs and symptoms of acute methylphenidate overdose, resulting principally from overstimulation of the CNS and from excessive sympathomimetic effects, may include the following: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, convulsions (may be followed by coma), euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, sweating, flushing, headache, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension, tachypnea, mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, and rhabdomyolysis.</p><h3>Management of Overdose</h3><p class="First">Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for up-to-date guidance and advice on the management of overdosage with methylphenidate. Provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdosages. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Use supportive and symptomatic measures.</p><p>Gastric contents may be evacuated by gastric lavage as indicated. Before performing gastric lavage, control agitation and seizures if present and protect the airway. Other measures to detoxify the gut include administration of activated charcoal and a cathartic. Intensive care must be provided to maintain adequate circulation and respiratory exchange; external cooling procedures may be required for pyrexia.</p><h2>Methylphenidate ER Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules contains methylphenidate hydrochloride, a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.

The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the <span class="Italics">d-</span> and <span class="Italics">l-</span>isomers. The <span class="Italics">d-</span>isomer is more pharmacologically active than the <span class="Italics">l-</span>isomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral administration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules in adults, plasma methylphenidate concentrations increase rapidly, reaching an initial maximum at about 2 hours, followed by gradual descending concentrations over the next 4 to 6 hours, after which a gradual increase begins, reaching a second peak at approximately 8 hours (Figure 1). The relative bioavailability of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules given once daily as compared to a methylphenidate immediate-release oral product given three times daily in adults is comparable. The relative bioavailability is 102%.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic profiles and parameters of methylphenidate are similar when Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules is administered either as a whole capsule or sprinkled onto applesauce in subjects under fasting conditions (see Table 2 and Figure 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Mean <span class="Italics">d,l</span>-Methylphenidate Plasma Concentration-Time Profiles following 80 mg Administered as Capsule and Sprinkle Dose in Healthy Adults</span></p><p></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily via deesterification to alpha-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (PPAA). The metabolite has little or no pharmacologic activity.</p><p>After oral dosing of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite was PPAA, accounting for approximately 80% of the dose.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Food Effects</span></p><p>Administration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules with high fat meal showed a decreased or diminished second peak. A high-fat meal also increased the average C<span class="Sub">max</span> of methylphenidate by about 28% and the AUC by about 19%. In the clinical trials of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, it was administered without regard to meals.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alcohol Effect</span></p><p>At an alcohol concentration up to 40%, there was 96% release of methylphenidate from Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules 80 mg within two hours. The results with the 80 mg capsule are considered to be representative of the other available capsules strengths.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Studies in Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Gender</span></p><p>There is insufficient experience with the use of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules to detect gender variations in pharmacokinetics.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Race</span></p><p>There is insufficient experience with the use of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Age</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules administration was studied in pediatric patients with ADHD between 6 and 12 years of age. Following administration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules, the bi-phasic plasma methylphenidate concentration profile was qualitatively similar in healthy adult volunteers and pediatric patients with ADHD. The bi-phasic profile in both groups is characterized by an early peak due to rapid absorption of the immediate-release component followed by a delayed, secondary peak due to the controlled-release component of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal Insufficiency</span></p><p>There is no experience with the use of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules in patients with renal insufficiency. After oral administration of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, methylphenidate was extensively metabolized and approximately 80% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in the form of ritalinic acid metabolite. Since renal clearance is not an important route of methylphenidate clearance, renal insufficiency is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Insufficiency</span></p><p>There is no experience with the use of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules in patients with hepatic insufficiency.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and, in males only, an increase in hepatoblastomas, at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors, and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.</p><p>Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 4 times the MRHD (children) on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames reverse mutation assay or in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay. Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased, indicative of a weak clastogenic response, in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Methylphenidate was negative <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in males and females in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Methylphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18-week Continuous Breeding study. The study was conducted at doses of up to 160 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules for the treatment of ADHD was established in a randomized, double-blind, single center, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose, cross-over trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years and a second randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, fixed–dose trial in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose, cross-over, analog classroom study (Study 1) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N=26) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive or combined inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive subtypes.</p><p>Following a 2 to 4 week open-label dose optimization phase in which patients received flexible-dose Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, or 40 mg administered once daily in the morning, patients were randomly assigned to Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules (dose from open-label phase) or placebo. After 1-week of treatment, patients were evaluated over a period of 12 hours. Subsequently, patients were given the opposite treatment for 1-week and returned for the second evaluation. Patients could then enter an open-label extension phase for up to 21 months.</p><p>Efficacy assessments were conducted at 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5 and 12 hours post-dose using the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M. Flynn, and Pelham Total score (SKAMP). The primary efficacy endpoint was the average SKAMP Total Score, comparing Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules to placebo. SKAMP is a validated 13-item teacher-rated scale that assesses manifestations of ADHD in a classroom setting.</p><p>The SKAMP Total Scores were statistically significantly better (lower) for Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules than for placebo at the test day average and at all time points (1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5 and 12 hours) post-dosing (see Figure 2).</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Absolute SKAMP- Total Score after treatment with Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules or Placebo (Study 1).</span></p><p></p><p>A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study (Study 2) was conducted in pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years (N=230) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive or combined inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive subtypes.</p><p>The ADHD-RS-IV is an 18-item questionnaire with a score range of 0 to 54 points that measures the core symptoms of ADHD and includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales.</p><p>Patients were randomized to a daily morning dose of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg, or placebo for 1 week. An 11-week open label phase followed the double-blind phase. Patients could then enter another open-label phase for up to 21 months.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean decrease from baseline to the end of Week 1 in the ADHD-RS-IV Total Score. Each of the four Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules doses (10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg/day) was compared to placebo at the end of week 1. For both the 20 mg/day and the 40 mg/day doses, Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules was superior to placebo in reduction of the ADHD-RS-IV Total Score, but not for the 10 mg/day or the 15 mg/day doses.</p><p>A total of 221 patients completed the 1-week double-blind phase.
