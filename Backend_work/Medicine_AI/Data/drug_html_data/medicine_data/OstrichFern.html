Tod.<br/><b>Common Name(s):</b> Fiddlehead fern, Ostrich fern, Shuttlecock fern, Wood fern</p><h2>Clinical Overview</h2><h3>Use</h3><p>Studies regarding the therapeutic applications of ostrich fern are limited. A small number of animal and in vitro studies have examined the fern's potential as an antioxidant, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory agent.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>No clinical evidence exists to support a specific dosage of ostrich fern.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications have not been identified.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>Adverse effects caused by ingestion of undercooked ostrich fern fiddleheads have included nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>No data.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Onocleaceae (formerly Dryopteridaceae)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>The ostrich fern is a common fern that grows in the north eastern United States and throughout Canada. The fern's characteristic long, green, feathery fronds lose their leaflets in the fall, leaving a dormant winter plant. Ostrich ferns grow up to 2 m in height and spread in moist conditions via underground rhizomes. Synonyms for the species include Matteuccia pensylvanica, Pteretis nodulosa, Pteretis pensylvanica, and Onoclea struthiopteris.USDA 2016, Wagstaff 2008</p><h2>History</h2><p>Fiddleheads (the young shoot tops) of the ostrich fern are a seasonal delicacy, harvested commercially throughout the north eastern United States and coastal Canadian provinces. Historically, this spring vegetable became a regular part of the diet of Canadian settlers by the early 1700s.von Aderkas 1984 Both the fronds and shoot tops of the ostrich fern are widely eaten in Japan, and they are also used in traditional Chinese medicine.Li 2015, Miyazawa 2007 Fiddleheads are available canned, frozen, or fresh. Limited screening studies have been conducted to identify potential therapeutic applications.</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Chromatographic studies have analyzed the constituents of ostrich fern,Li 2013, Zhang 2008 which include xanthophyll pigments, essential fatty acids (including linolenic, arachidonic, and eicosapentaenoic acids),de Long 2011 flavones (demethoxymatteucinol, matteucinol, matteuorien), and stilbenes (pinosylvin, pinosylvin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 5-beta-D-glucosyloxy-3-hydroxyl-trans-stilbene-2-carboxylic acid).Li 2013, Li 2015 The antioxidant compounds chlorogenic acid and caffeoylhomoserine have also been described.Miyazawa 2007</p><p>An essential oil of ostrich fern has been described as containing at least 100 compounds, notably (E)-phytol, nonanal, and decanal as main compounds, as well as other aromatic aldehyde compounds.Miyazawa 2007 Ostrich fern has been reported to accumulate some heavy metals;Burns 1988 however, no evidence of toxicity was found in an evaluation of a limited number of cases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.CDC 1994</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Antimicrobial effect</h3><p>No animal data exist regarding the use of ostrich fern for antimicrobial effects.</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of ostrich fern for antimicrobial effects; however, extracted flavonoids showed in vitro activity against the H1N1 influenza virus in one study.Li 2015</p><h3>Anti-inflammatory</h3><p>In one study, M. struthiopteris polysaccharides inhibited production of immunoglobulin in mice with induced systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. Weight loss and spleen swelling were also diminished in the treated group.Wang 2010 Anti-inflammatory activity has also been noted in in vitro studies.Dion 2015</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of ostrich fern for anti-inflammatory effects.</p><h3>Cancer</h3><p>No animal data exist regarding the use of ostrich fern in cancer.</p><p>No clinical data exist regarding the use of ostrich fern in cancer; however, one study of plant extracts demonstrated differentiation-inducing activity against human leukemia cells.Hata 1998</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>Antioxidant activity has been studied in chemical assays.de Long 2011, DeLong 2013 A screening study of 7 edible plants, including ostrich fern, examined the activity of extracts on triglyceride and cholesterol levels.Takahashi 2011</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>No clinical evidence exists to support a specific dosage of ostrich fern. Because of the potential presence of heat-labile toxin within ostrich fern, the plant should be cooked thoroughly before consumption.CDC 1994</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The fiddleheads of the ostrich fern are generally considered edible once they have been steamed, and there have been no recent reports of adverse effects. However, in the mid-1990s, several outbreaks of food poisoning in New York and western Canada were associated with the consumption of raw or lightly cooked fiddleheads.CDC 1994 Symptoms were reported within 12 hours after ingestion, with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping being the most commonly reported adverse reactions.CDC 1994 Because no reports of illness were associated with fiddleheads that had been boiled or steamed for at least 10 minutes, thorough cooking is recommended.CDC 1995</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Information regarding the toxicity of ostrich fern is lacking.</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Matteuccia pensylvanica</i></li><li><i>Onoclea struthiopteris</i></li><li><i>Pteretis nodulosa</i></li><li><i>Pteretis pensylvanica</i></li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
