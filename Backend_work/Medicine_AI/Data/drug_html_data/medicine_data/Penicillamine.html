In certain conditions, excess copper can build up in the blood stream, leading to tissue damage throughout the body.</p><p>Penicillamine is used to remove excess copper in people with an inherited condition called Wilson's disease.</p><p>Penicillamine is also used to reduce urine levels of an amino acid called cystine, which can cause stones to form in the kidneys and bladder in people with an inherited condition called cystinuria.</p><p>Penicillamine is also used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis after other medicines have been tried without success. Penicillamine is not approved to treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Penicillamine may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use penicillamine if you are breast-feeding, if you have ever had an infection or damaged blood cells caused by penicillamine, or if you have kidney disease and you need penicillamine to treat rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Every person taking penicillamine should remain under the close supervision of a doctor.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use penicillamine if you are allergic to it, or if:</p><ul>
