Pharmacokinetic studies have revealed adjusted body weight (AdjBW), using a correction factor of 0.4, is the most appropriate weight metric to correct V<sub>d</sub> in the setting of obesity. However, there is wide variation in the correction factors reported which could lead to under- or over-dosing in clinical practice (MacDougall 2011; Pai 2007). Early use of therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended (Pai 2014).</p><p><b>Obese patients (total body weight &gt;125% of ideal body weight):</b></p><p><b>IV:</b> Use 40% <b>AdjBW </b>for initial weight-based dosing when targeting C<sub>max</sub>/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) goals with either loading dose equation or mg/kg approach and when estimating kidney function with Cockcroft-Gault (CrCl) (Bland 2018; Pai 2014; Traynor 1995). Alternatively, use 40% <b>AdjBW</b> to estimate CrCl and aminoglycoside clearance with the Bayesian approach when targeting AUC/MIC goals (Bland 2018; Pai 2014). <b>Note:</b> If aminoglycoside therapy is continued, use C<sub>max</sub>/MIC or AUC/MIC goals to optimize therapy, especially in the critically ill where weight and kidney function may be poor surrogates of V<sub>d</sub> and clearance (Hassan 1987; Rughoo 2014).</p><p>AdjBW = [0.4 × (total body weight - ideal body weight) + ideal body weight].</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>For intravenous administration, dilute in a compatible solution (eg, NS, D5W) to a final concentration of 0.25 to 5 mg/mL.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IM: Administer IM injection in large muscle mass.</p><p>IV: Infuse over 30 to 60 minutes.</p><p>Some penicillins (eg, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and piperacillin) have been shown to inactivate <i>in vitro</i>.

Concurrent use of these agents may pose a risk of reduced antibacterial efficacy <i>in vivo</i>, particularly in the setting of profound renal impairment.

The risk of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is greater in patients with renal damage. High frequency deafness usually occurs first and can be detected only by audiometric testing. Vertigo may occur and may be evidence of vestibular injury. Other manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, and convulsions. The risk of hearing loss due to aminoglycosides increases with the degree of exposure to either high peak or high trough serum concentrations. Patients developing cochlear damage may not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of developing eighth-nerve toxicity, and total or partial irreversible bilateral deafness may occur after the drug has been discontinued. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is usually irreversible. Patients treated with parenteral aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation because of the potential ototoxicity associated with their use. Safety for treatment periods which are longer than 14 days has not been established.</p><p>Aminoglycosides are potentially nephrotoxic. The risk of nephrotoxicity is greater in patients with impaired renal function and in those who receive high doses or prolonged therapy. Patients treated with parenteral aminoglycosides should be under close clinical observation because of the potential nephrotoxicity associated with their use. Safety for treatment periods which are longer than 14 days has not been established.</p><p>Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis have been reported following parenteral injection, topical instillation (as in orthopedic and abdominal irrigation or in local treatment of empyema), and following oral use of aminoglycosides. The possibility of these phenomena should be considered if aminoglycosides are administered by any route, especially in patients receiving anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents such as tubocurarine, succinylcholine, decamethonium, or in patients receiving massive transfusions of citrate-anticoagulated blood. If blockage occurs, calcium salts may reverse these phenomena, but mechanical respiratory assistance may be necessary.</p><p>Renal and eighth-nerve function should be closely monitored especially in patients with known or suspected renal impairment at the onset of therapy and also in those whose renal function is initially normal but who develop signs of renal dysfunction during therapy. Serum concentrations of amikacin should be monitored when feasible to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels and prolonged peak concentrations above 35 mcg/mL. Urine should be examined for decreased specific gravity, increased excretion of proteins, and the presence of cells or casts. Blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, or creatinine clearance should be measured periodically. Serial audiograms should be obtained where feasible in patients old enough to be tested, particularly high-risk patients. Evidence of ototoxicity (dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, roaring in the ears, and hearing loss) or nephrotoxicity requires discontinuation of the drug or dosage adjustment.</p><p>Concurrent and/or sequential systemic, oral, or topical use of other neurotoxic or nephrotoxic products, particularly bacitracin, cisplatin, amphotericin B, cephaloridine, paromomycin, viomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, vancomycin, or other aminoglycosides should be avoided. Other factors that may increase risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.</p><p>The concurrent use of amikacin with potent diuretics (ethacrynic acid, or furosemide) should be avoided because diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity. In addition, when administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycosides may occur.</p><p>• Nephrotoxicity:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: May cause nephrotoxicity;</b> usual risk factors include preexisting renal impairment, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, advanced age and dehydration. Discontinue treatment if signs of nephrotoxicity occur; renal damage is usually reversible.</p><p>• Neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: May cause neuromuscular blockade and respiratory paralysis; </b> especially when given soon after anesthesia or muscle relaxants.</p><p>• Neurotoxicity: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: May cause neurotoxicity; </b>usual risk factors include preexisting renal impairment, concomitant neuro-/nephrotoxic medications, advanced age and dehydration. Ototoxicity is proportional to the amount of drug given and the duration of treatment. Tinnitus or vertigo may be indications of vestibular injury and impending bilateral irreversible damage. Discontinue treatment if signs of ototoxicity occur.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>C. difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hearing impairment: Use with caution in patients with preexisting vertigo, tinnitus, or hearing loss.</p><p>• Hypocalcemia: Use with caution in patients with hypocalcemia.</p><p>• Neuromuscular disorders: Use with caution in patients with neuromuscular disorders, including myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency; dosage modification required.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Avoid concomitant or sequential use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs (eg, bacitracin, cisplatin, amphotericin B, paromomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, vancomycin, other aminoglycosides).</b></p><p>• Potent diuretics: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Avoid concomitant use with potent diuretics (eg, ethacrynic acid, furosemide) since diuretics themselves may cause ototoxicity and may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity.</b></p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Sulfites: May contain sulfites which may cause allergic-type reactions (including anaphylaxis) as well as life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain individuals.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Surgical irrigation: Irreversible deafness, renal failure, and death due to neuromuscular blockade have been reported following use of aminoglycosides as surgical irrigation; rapid systemic absorption occurs with topical application (except to the urinary bladder).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Urinalysis, BUN, serum creatinine, appropriately timed peak and trough concentrations, vital signs, temperature, weight, I &amp; O, hearing parameters</p><p>Initial and periodic peak and trough plasma drug levels should be determined, particularly in critically-ill patients with serious infections or in disease states known to significantly alter aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics (eg, cystic fibrosis, burns, or major surgery). Aminoglycoside levels measured from blood taken from Silastic® central catheters can sometimes give falsely high readings (draw levels from alternate lumen or peripheral stick, if possible).</p><p>Some penicillin derivatives may accelerate the degradation of aminoglycosides <i>in vitro</i>. This may be clinically-significant for certain penicillin (ticarcillin, piperacillin, carbenicillin) and aminoglycoside (gentamicin, tobramycin) combination therapy in patients with significant renal impairment. Close monitoring of aminoglycoside levels is warranted.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in females of reproductive potential. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (Esmail 2018).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Amikacin crosses the placenta.</p><p>Aminoglycosides may cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy. There are several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received a different aminoglycoside (streptomycin) during pregnancy. Although serious side effects to the fetus/infant have not been reported following maternal use of all aminoglycosides, a potential for harm exists.</p><p>Due to pregnancy-induced physiologic changes, some pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenous amikacin may be altered. Thirty patients between 6 to 20 weeks' gestation were given a single IM dose of amikacin 7.5 mg/kg within 24 hours prior to elective hysterectomy and therapeutic abortion. Mean peak concentrations and half-life of amikacin were slightly lower than in nonpregnant adults but still within the normal therapeutic range (Bernard 1977).</p><p>Amikacin is recommended off label as part of a multiantibiotic treatment regimen of nontuberculosis<i> Mycobacterium avium </i>complex (MAC) in patients with cystic fibrosis in certain situations; route of administration (IV or nebulized) may be dependent upon severity and location of infection (CFF/ECFS [Floto 2016]). Use of the IV route should be reserved for life-threatening infections in pregnant patients due to the potential risk of fetal toxicity (Panchaud 2016).</p><p>Amikacin is used off label for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis infection is associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, preterm birth, and perinatal death (Esmail 2018; Miele 2020), as well as adverse maternal outcomes, including increased risks for anemia and cesarean delivery. Placental transmission may rarely occur with active maternal disease (Miele 2020). The treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in pregnant patients should be individualized; evidence to support a specific regimen is not available (ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA [Nahid 2019]; WHO 2020). When second-line agents are needed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis during pregnancy, aminoglycosides should be avoided when alternative agents are effective (ATS/CDC/ERS/IDSA [Nahid 2019]). Amikacin may be considered when an aminoglycoside is needed (HHS [OI adult 2020]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat bacterial infections.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
