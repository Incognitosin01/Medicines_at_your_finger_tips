This may help prevent medical problems caused by cholesterol clogging the blood vessels. Cholestyramine is also used to remove substances called bile acids from your body. With some liver problems, there is too much bile acid in your body and this can cause severe itching.</p><p>Cholestyramine works by attaching to certain substances in the intestine. Since cholestyramine is not absorbed into the body, these substances also pass out of the body without being absorbed.</p><p>Cholestyramine may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Cholestyramine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Novo-Cholamine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
