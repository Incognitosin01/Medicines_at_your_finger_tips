</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for M-M-R II Vaccine</h2><p class="First">M-M-R<span class="Sup">®</span> II is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella in individuals 12 months of age and older.</p><h2>M-M-R II Vaccine Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For subcutaneous use only.</span></p><h3>Dose and Schedule</h3><p class="First">Each 0.5 mL dose is administered subcutaneously.</p><p>The first dose is administered at 12 to 15 months of age. A second dose is administered at 4 to 6 years of age.</p><p>The second dose may be administered prior to 4 years of age, provided that there is a minimum interval of one month between the doses of measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccine, live {1-2}.</p><p>Children who received an initial dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine prior to their first birthday should receive additional doses of vaccine at 12-15 months of age and at 4-6 years of age to complete the vaccination series <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><p>For post-exposure prophylaxis for measles, administer a dose of M-M-R II Vaccine within 72 hours after exposure.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration</h3><p class="First">Use a sterile syringe free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents for each injection and/or reconstitution of the vaccine because these substances may inactivate the live virus vaccine. To reconstitute, use only the diluent supplied with the vaccine since it is free of preservatives or other antiviral substances which might inactivate the vaccine.</p><p>Withdraw the entire volume of the supplied diluent from its vial and inject into lyophilized vaccine vial. Agitate to dissolve completely. Discard if the lyophilized vaccine cannot be dissolved.</p><p>Withdraw the entire volume of the reconstituted vaccine and inject subcutaneously into the outer aspect of the upper arm (deltoid region) or into the higher anterolateral area of the thigh.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Visually inspect the vaccine before and after reconstitution prior to administration. Before reconstitution, the lyophilized vaccine is a light yellow compact crystalline plug, when reconstituted, is a clear yellow liquid. Discard if particulate matter or discoloration are observed in the reconstituted vaccine.</p><p>To minimize loss of potency, administer M-M-R II as soon as possible after reconstitution. If not used immediately, the reconstituted vaccine may be stored between 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C), protected from light, for up to 8 hours. Discard reconstituted vaccine if it is not used within 8 hours.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">M-M-R II Vaccine is a suspension for injection supplied as a single dose vial of lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted using the accompanying sterile diluent <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]</span>. A single dose after reconstitution is 0.5 mL.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Do not administer M-M-R II Vaccine to individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine (including gelatin) {3} or who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction following administration of a previous dose of M-M-R II Vaccine or any other measles, mumps and rubella-containing vaccine. Do not administer M-M-R II Vaccine to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to neomycin <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)].</span></p><h3>Immunosuppression</h3><p class="First">Do not administer M-M-R II Vaccine to individuals who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or medical therapy. Measles inclusion body encephalitis {4} (MIBE), pneumonitis {5} and death as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported in immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing vaccine. In this population, disseminated mumps and rubella vaccine virus infection have also been reported.</p><p>Do not administer M-M-R II to individuals with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.</p><h3>Moderate or Severe Febrile Illness</h3><p class="First">Do not administer M-M-R II Vaccine to individuals with an active febrile illness with fever &gt;101.3°F (&gt;38.5°C).</p><h3>Active Untreated Tuberculosis</h3><p class="First">Do not administer M-M-R II Vaccine to individuals with active untreated tuberculosis (TB).</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Do not administer M-M-R II to individuals who are pregnant or who are planning on becoming pregnant within the next month <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Febrile Seizure</h3><p class="First">There is a risk of fever and associated febrile seizure in the first 2 weeks following immunization with M-M-R II Vaccine. For children who have experienced a previous febrile seizure (from any cause) and those with a family history of febrile seizures there is a small increase in risk of febrile seizure following receipt of M-M-R II Vaccine <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity to Eggs</h3><p class="First">Individuals with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions after receiving M-M-R II Vaccine. The potential risks and known benefits should be evaluated before considering vaccination in these individuals.</p><h3>Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">Transient thrombocytopenia has been reported within 4-6 weeks following vaccination with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Carefully evaluate the potential risk and benefit of vaccination in children with thrombocytopenia or in those who experienced thrombocytopenia after vaccination with a previous dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine {6-8} <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><h3>Immune Globulins and Transfusions</h3><p class="First">Immune Globulins (IG) and other blood products should not be given concurrently with M-M-R II <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>. These products may contain antibodies that interfere with vaccine virus replication and decrease the expected immune response.</p><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has specific recommendations for intervals between administration of antibody containing products and live virus vaccines.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions include those identified during clinical trials or reported during post-approval use of M-M-R II Vaccine or its individual components.</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole</span></p><p>    Panniculitis; atypical measles; fever; syncope; headache; dizziness; malaise; irritability.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>    Vasculitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digestive System</span></p><p>    Pancreatitis; diarrhea; vomiting; parotitis; nausea.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hematologic and Lymphatic Systems</span></p><p>    Thrombocytopenia; purpura; regional lymphadenopathy; leukocytosis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune System</span></p><p>    Anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema (including peripheral or facial edema) and bronchial spasm.</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal System</span></p><p>    Arthritis; arthralgia; myalgia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System</span></p><p>    Encephalitis; encephalopathy; measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE); Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS); acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM); transverse myelitis; febrile convulsions; afebrile convulsions or seizures; ataxia; polyneuritis; polyneuropathy; ocular palsies; paresthesia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory System</span></p><p>    Pneumonia; pneumonitis; sore throat; cough; rhinitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin</span></p><p>    Stevens-Johnson syndrome; acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy; Henoch-Schönlein purpura; erythema multiforme; urticaria; rash; measles-like rash; pruritus; injection site reactions (pain, erythema, swelling and vesiculation).</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses — Ear</span></p><p>    Nerve deafness; otitis media.</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses — Eye</span></p><p>    Retinitis; optic neuritis; papillitis; conjunctivitis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Urogenital System</span></p><p>    Epididymitis; orchitis.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Corticosteroids and Immunosuppressive Drugs</h3><p class="First">M-M-R II Vaccine should not be administered to individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including high dose corticosteroids. Vaccination with M-M-R II Vaccine can result in disseminated disease due to measles vaccine in individuals on immunosuppressive drugs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2)].</span></p><h3>Immune Globulins and Transfusions</h3><p class="First">Administration of immune globulins and other blood products concurrently with M-M-R II Vaccine may interfere with the expected immune response {9-11} <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span> The ACIP has specific recommendations for intervals between administration of antibody containing products and live virus vaccines.</p><h3>Tuberculin Skin Testing</h3><p class="First">It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin skin test with tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) is to be done, it should be administered before, simultaneously with, or at least 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with M-M-R II Vaccine.</p><h3>Use with Other Live Viral Vaccines</h3><p class="First">M-M-R II Vaccine can be administered concurrently with other live viral vaccines. If not given concurrently, M-M-R II Vaccine should be given one month before or one month after administration of other live viral vaccines to avoid potential for immune interference.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>M-M-R II Vaccine is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because infection during pregnancy with the wild-type viruses has been associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes.</p><p>Increased rates of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery and congenital defects have been observed following infection with wild-type measles during pregnancy. {12,13} Wild-type mumps infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of spontaneous abortion.</p><p>Infection with wild-type rubella during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth. If rubella infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, it can result in severe congenital defects, Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the infant includes but is not limited to eye manifestations (cataracts, glaucoma, retinitis), congenital heart defects, hearing loss, microcephaly, and intellectual disabilities. M-M-R II Vaccine contains live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella viruses. It is not known whether M-M-R II Vaccine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of M-M-R II Vaccine administration to pregnant women.</p><p>All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p>Available data suggest the rates of major birth defects and miscarriage in women who received M-M-R II Vaccine within 30 days prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy are consistent with estimated background rates <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Human Data</span></p><p>A cumulative assessment of post-marketing reports for M-M-R II Vaccine from licensure 01 April 1978 through 31 December 2018, identified 796 reports of inadvertent administration of M-M-R II Vaccine occurring 30 days before or at any time during pregnancy with known pregnancy outcomes. Of the prospectively followed pregnancies for whom the timing of M-M-R II vaccination was known, 425 women received M-M-R II Vaccine during the 30 days prior to conception through the second trimester. The outcomes for these 425 prospectively followed pregnancies included 16 infants with major birth defects, 4 cases of fetal death and 50 cases of miscarriage. No abnormalities compatible with congenital rubella syndrome have been identified in patients who received M-M-R II Vaccine. Rubella vaccine virus can cross the placenta, leading to asymptomatic infection of the fetus. Mumps vaccine virus has also been shown to infect the placenta {14}, but there is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations or disease in the fetus or infant.</p><p>The CDC established the Vaccine in Pregnancy registry (1971-1989) of women who had received rubella vaccines within 3 months before or after conception. Data on 1221 inadvertently vaccinated pregnant women demonstrated no evidence of an increase in fetal abnormalities or cases of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) in the enrolled women {15}.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk. Studies have shown that lactating postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella vaccine may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. {16,17} In the breast-fed infants with serological evidence of rubella virus vaccine strain antibodies, none exhibited severe disease; however, one exhibited mild clinical illness typical of acquired rubella. {18,19}</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for M-M-R II, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from M-M-R II or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">M-M-R II Vaccine is not approved for individuals less than 12 months of age. Safety and effectiveness of measles vaccine in infants below the age of 6 months have not been established <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. Safety and effectiveness of mumps and rubella vaccine in infants less than 12 months of age have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of M-M-R II did not include sufficient numbers of seronegative subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>M-M-R II Vaccine Description</h2><p class="First">M-M-R II Vaccine is a sterile lyophilized preparation of (1) Measles Virus Vaccine Live, an attenuated line of measles virus, derived from Enders' attenuated Edmonston strain and propagated in chick embryo cell culture; (2) Mumps Virus Vaccine Live, the Jeryl Lynn™ (B level) strain of mumps virus propagated in chick embryo cell culture; and (3) Rubella Virus Vaccine Live, the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus propagated in WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts. {20,21} The cells, virus pools, recombinant human serum albumin and fetal bovine serum used in manufacturing are tested and determined to be free of adventitious agents.</p><p>After reconstitution, each 0.5 mL dose contains not less than 3.0 log<span class="Sub">10</span> TCID<span class="Sub">50</span> (tissue culture infectious doses) of measles virus; 4.1 log<span class="Sub">10</span> TCID<span class="Sub">50</span> of mumps virus; and 3.0 log<span class="Sub">10</span> TCID<span class="Sub">50</span> of rubella virus.</p><p>Each dose is calculated to contain sorbitol (14.5 mg), sucrose (1.9 mg), hydrolyzed gelatin (14.5 mg), recombinant human albumin (≤0.3 mg), fetal bovine serum (&lt;1 ppm), approximately 25 mcg of neomycin and other buffer and media ingredients. The product contains no preservative.</p><h2>M-M-R II Vaccine - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">M-M-R II vaccination induces antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella associated with protection which can be measured by neutralization assays, hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays, or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. Results from efficacy studies or effectiveness studies that were previously conducted for the component vaccines of M-M-R II were used to define levels of serum antibodies that correlated with protection against measles, mumps, and rubella <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><h3>Persistence of Antibody Responses After Vaccination</h3><p class="First">Neutralizing and ELISA antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in 95-100%, 74-91%, and 90-100% of individuals respectively, 11 to 13 years after primary vaccination. {22-28}</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">M-M-R II Vaccine has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Clinical Efficacy</h3><p class="First">Efficacy of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines was established in a series of double-blind controlled trials. {29-34} These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella paralleled protection. {35-38}</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies enrolling 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that M-M-R II Vaccine is immunogenic. In these studies, a single injection of the vaccine induced measles HI antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralizing antibodies in 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible individuals.</p><p>A study of 6-month-old and 15-month-old infants born to mothers vaccinated with a measles vaccine in childhood, demonstrated that, following infant and toddler vaccination with Measles Virus Vaccine, Live (previously US-licensed, manufactured by Merck), 74% of the 6-month-old infants developed detectable neutralizing antibody titers while 100% of the 15-month-old infants vaccinated with Measles Virus Vaccine, Live or M-M-R II Vaccine developed neutralizing antibodies {39}. When the 6-month-old infants of immunized mothers were revaccinated at 15 months with M-M-R II Vaccine, they developed antibody titers similar to those of toddlers who were vaccinated previously at 15-months of age.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">No. 4681 — M-M-R II Vaccine is supplied as follows:<br/>

Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live</span></p><p class="First">This is a summary of information about M-M-R<span class="Sup">®</span> II. You should read it before you or your child receives the vaccine. If you have any questions about the vaccine after reading this leaflet, you should ask your health care provider. This is a summary only. It does not take the place of talking about M-M-R II with your doctor, nurse, or other health care provider. Only your health care provider can decide if M-M-R II is right for you or your child.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">What is M-M-R II and how does it work?</span></span></p><p>M-M-R II is also known as Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live. It is a live virus vaccine that is given as a shot. This vaccine is usually given to people one year old or older. It is meant to help prevent measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles).</p><p>M-M-R II contains weakened forms of measles virus, mumps virus, and rubella virus.</p><p>M-M-R II works by helping the immune system protect you or your child from getting measles, mumps, or rubella.</p><p>M-M-R II may not protect everyone who gets the vaccine. M-M-R II does not treat measles, mumps, or rubella once you or your child has them.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">What do I need to know about measles, mumps, and rubella?</span></span></p><p>Measles is also known as rubeola. It is a serious illness. Measles virus can be passed to others if you have it. Measles can give you a high fever, cough, and a rash. The illness can last for 1 to 2 weeks. In rare cases, it can also cause an infection of the brain. This could lead to seizures, hearing loss, intellectual disability, and even death.</p><p>Mumps can also be passed to others. This virus can cause fever and headache. It can also make the glands under your jaw swell and be painful. The illness often lasts for several days. Sometimes, mumps can make the testicles swell and be painful. In some cases, it can cause meningitis, which is a swelling of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>Rubella is also known as German measles. It is often a mild illness. Rubella virus can cause a mild fever, swollen glands in the neck, pain and swelling in the joints, and a rash that lasts for a short time. It can be very dangerous if a pregnant woman catches it. Women who catch German measles when they are pregnant can have babies who are stillborn. Also, the babies may be blind or deaf, or have heart disease or intellectual disability.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Who should not get M-M-R II?</span></span></p><p>Do not get M-M-R II if you or your child:</p><ul>

<li>are allergic to eggs.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">How is M-M-R II given?</span></span></p><p>M-M-R II is given as a shot to people one year old or older. The dose of the vaccine is the same for everyone. If your child gets the shot when he or she is one year old or older, a second dose is recommended. Often, the second dose is given right before the child goes to elementary school (4 to 6 years of age), but may be given earlier as long as the second dose is at least one month after the first dose.</p><p>If your child is less than one year old when he or she first gets the shot, a second dose should be given when they are 12 to 15 months old. Then, a third shot should be given between 4 and 6 years of age. Your doctor will decide the best time and number of shots by using official recommendations.</p><p>If a dose is missed, your health care provider will let you know when you should have it.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">What are the possible side effects of M-M-R II?</span></span></p><p>The most common side effect of vaccination with M-M-R II is pain at the site of the shot for a short time.</p><p>Other side effects may include:</p><ul>
<li>Fever</li>
