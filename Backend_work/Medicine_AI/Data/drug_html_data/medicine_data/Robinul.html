It is also used to treat chronic, severe drooling caused by certain neurologic disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy) in children 3 to 16 years of age. This medicine is an anticholinergic.</p><p>Glycopyrrolate may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Robinul</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of glycopyrrolate in children 3 to 16 years of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 3 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on whether the risk of glycopyrrolate-induced adverse effects are increased in the elderly; however, it should be used with caution because elderly patients are more likely to have age related liver disease, kidney disease, heart disease, or prostate problems. This may require a dosage adjustment or careful monitoring in elderly patients receiving glycopyrrolate.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
