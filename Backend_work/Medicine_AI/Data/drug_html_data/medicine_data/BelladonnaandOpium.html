Atropine blocks the action of acetylcholine at parasympathetic sites in smooth muscle, secretory glands, and the CNS causing a relaxation of smooth muscle and drying of secretions.  The principle agent in opium is morphine. Morphine binds to opiate receptors in the CNS, causing inhibition of ascending pain pathways, altering the perception of and response to pain.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Rectal absorption is dependent upon body hydration, not temperature</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hepatic</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Pain associated with ureteral spasm</b><b>:</b> Management of ureteral spasm pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic.</p><p>Limitations of use: Reserve belladonna and opium suppositories for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (eg, nonopioid analgesics or opioid combination products) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to belladonna, opium, or any component of the formulation; significant respiratory depression; acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment; use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (concurrent or within 14 days); GI obstruction (known or suspected), including paralytic ileus; glaucoma; severe renal or hepatic disease; opioid idiosyncrasies; convulsive disorders; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; premature labor.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling</i>: Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Severe CNS depression; increased cerebrospinal or intracranial pressure; head injury; obstructive uropathy (eg, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon; suspected surgical abdomen (eg, acute appendicitis or pancreatitis); myasthenia gravis (unless used to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase agent); tachycardia secondary to cardiac insufficiency or thyrotoxicosis; acute hemorrhage with unstable cardiovascular status; mild pain that can be managed with other pain medications; chronic obstructive airway; hypercarbia; cor pulmonale.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Pain</b><b> associated with ureteral spasm<b>:</b></b> <b>Note:</b> Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Rectal: One suppository 1 to 2 times daily; maximum: 4 doses/day</p><p><i>Conversion from other opioids to belladonna and opium suppositories: </i>There are no specific dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer’s labeling; however, upon conversion, initially underestimate a patient’s 24-hour belladonna and opium suppository dosage.</p><p><i>Conversion from belladonna and opium suppositories to an extended-release opioid: </i>There are no specific dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer’s labeling, therefore, conversion must be accompanied by close monitoring for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy:</b> Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).</p><p>• Hypotension: May cause severe hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension and syncope); use with caution in patients with hypovolemia, cardiovascular disease (including acute MI), circulatory shock, or drugs that may exaggerate hypotensive effects (including phenothiazines or general anesthetics). Monitor for symptoms of hypotension following initiation or dose titration. Avoid use in patients with circulatory shock.</p><p>• Phenanthrene hypersensitivity: Use with caution in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to other phenanthrene-derivative opioid agonists (codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, levorphanol, oxycodone, oxymorphone).</p><p>• Respiratory depression: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, especially during initiation or dose escalation.</b> Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Patients and caregivers should be educated on how to recognize respiratory depression and the importance of getting emergency assistance immediately (eg, calling 911) in the event of known or suspected overdose.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Adrenal insufficiency: Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, including Addison disease. Long-term opioid (one month or greater) use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to mood disorders and osteoporosis (Brennan 2013).</p><p>• Biliary tract impairment: Use opium with caution in patients with biliary tract dysfunction, including acute pancreatitis; may cause constriction of sphincter of Oddi.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease.</p><p>• Drug abuse: Use with caution in patients with a history of opioid drug abuse or acute alcoholism; potential for drug dependency exists. Tolerance, psychological and physical dependence may occur with prolonged use.</p><p>• Head trauma: Use with extreme caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure (ICP); exaggerated elevation of ICP may occur.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia; may cause urinary retention.</p><p>• Psychosis: Use with caution in patients with toxic psychosis; may exacerbate condition.</p><p>• Respiratory disease: Use with caution and monitor for respiratory depression in patients with significant COPD or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression, particularly when initiating and titrating therapy; critical respiratory depression may occur, even at therapeutic dosages. Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients.</p><p>• Seizure disorders: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders; may cause or exacerbate preexisting seizures.</p><p>• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with myxedema; may exacerbate condition.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of morphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosage and durations to the minimum required and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</b> Consider prescribing naloxone for emergency treatment of opioid overdose in patients taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants concomitantly with opioids. Use is contraindicated in patients with acute alcoholism.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Cachectic or debilitated patients: Use with caution in cachectic or debilitated patients; there is a greater potential for critical respiratory depression, even at therapeutic dosages. Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients.</p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in elderly patients; may be more sensitive to anticholinergic and opioid-induced adverse effects. Use opioids for chronic pain with caution in this age group; monitor closely due to an increased potential for risks, including certain risks such as falls/fracture, cognitive impairment, and constipation. Clearance may also be reduced in older adults (with or without renal impairment) resulting in a narrow therapeutic window and increasing the risk for respiratory depression or overdose (Dowell [CDC 2016]). Consider the use of alternative nonopioid analgesics in these patients.</p><p>• Neonates: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Prolonged maternal use of opioids during pregnancy can cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome in the newborn, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If prolonged opioid therapy is required in a pregnant woman, ensure treatment is available and warn patient of risk to the neonate.</b> Signs and symptoms include irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. Onset, duration, and severity depend on the drug used, duration of use, maternal dose, and rate of drug elimination by the newborn.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Abuse/misuse/diversion: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Belladonna and opium exposes patients and other users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, potentially leading to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing; monitor all patients regularly for development of these behaviors or conditions.</b> Use with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse or acute alcoholism; potential for drug dependency exists. Other factors associated with increased risk include younger age, concomitant depression (major), and psychotropic medication use. Consider offering naloxone prescriptions in patients with factors associated with an increased risk for overdose, such as history of overdose or substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (≥50 morphine milligram equivalents/day orally), and concomitant benzodiazepine use (Dowell [CDC 2016]).</p><p>• Accidental exposure:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Accidental exposure of even one dose of belladonna and opium suppositories, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of opium.</b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals.</p><p>• Naloxone access: Discuss the availability of naloxone with all patients who are prescribed opioid analgesics, as well as their caregivers, and consider prescribing it to patients who are at increased risk of opioid overdose. These include patients who are also taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, have an opioid use disorder (OUD) (current or history of), or have experienced a previous opioid overdose. Additionally, health care providers should consider prescribing naloxone to patients prescribed medications to treat OUD; patients at risk of opioid overdose, even if they are not taking an opioid analgesic or medication to treat OUD; and patients taking opioids, including methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, if they have household members, including children, or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. Inform patients and caregivers on options for obtaining naloxone (eg, by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, a community-based program) as permitted by state dispensing and prescribing guidelines. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, proper administration of naloxone, and getting emergency help (FDA 2020).</p><p>• Withdrawal: Concurrent use of mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (eg, pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol) or partial agonist (eg, buprenorphine) analgesics may precipitate withdrawal symptoms and/or reduced analgesic efficacy in patients following prolonged therapy with mu opioid agonists. Do not abruptly discontinue; taper dose gradually when discontinuing.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Pain relief, respiratory and mental status, blood pressure; bowel motility; signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction; signs or symptoms of hypogonadism or hypoadrenalism (Brennan 2013).
