Administration with food substantially increases the absorption of lurasidone hydrochloride. Administration with food increases the AUC approximately 2-fold and increases the C<span class="Sub">max</span> approximately 3-fold. In the clinical studies, lurasidone hydrochloride tablets was administered with food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>The effectiveness of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets for longer-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks, has not been established in controlled studies. Therefore, the physician who elects to use lurasidone hydrochloride tablets for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Dose Modifications for Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dose adjustment is recommended in moderate (creatinine clearance: 30 mL/min to &lt; 50 mL/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min) patients. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day. The dose in these patients should not exceed 80 mg per day <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Dose Modifications for Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dose adjustment is recommended in moderate (Child-Pugh Score = 7 to 9) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score = 10 to 15) patients. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day. The dose in moderate hepatic impairment patients should not exceed 80 mg per day and the dose in severe hepatic impairment patients should not exceed 40 per mg/day <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</span></p><h3>Dose Modifications Due to Drug Interactions of CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP3A4 Inducers</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors</span></span></p><p>Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets should not be used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, voriconazole, mibefradil, etc.) <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p>If lurasidone hydrochloride tablets are being prescribed and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., diltiazem, atazanavir, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil etc.) is added to the therapy, the lurasidone hydrochloride tablets dose should be reduced to half of the original dose level. Similarly, if a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is being prescribed and lurasidone hydrochloride tablets are added to the therapy, the recommended starting dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablet is 20 mg per day, and the maximum recommended dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablet is 80 mg per day <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p>Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided in patients taking lurasidone hydrochloride tablets, since these may inhibit CYP3A4 and alter lurasidone hydrochloride concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Inducers</span></span></p><p>Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets should not be used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., rifampin, avasimibe, St. John’s wort, phenytoin, carbamazepine, etc.) <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4); Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. If lurasidone hydrochloride tablets are used concomitantly with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, it may be necessary to increase the lurasidone hydrochloride tablets dose after chronic treatment (7 days or more) with the CYP3A4 inducer.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets are available in the following shape and color (Table 1) with respective one-sided debossing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Lurasidone Hydrochloride Tablet Presentations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tablet Strength</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tablet Color/Shape</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tablet Markings</span></p><p class="First">20 mg</p><p class="First">white to off-white round</p><p class="First">A20</p><p class="First">40 mg</p><p class="First">white to off-white round</p><p class="First">A40</p><p class="First">60 mg</p><p class="First">white to off-white oblong</p><p class="First">A60</p><p class="First">80 mg</p><p class="First">green to light green oval</p><p class="First">A80</p><p class="First">120 mg</p><p class="First">white to off-white oval</p><p class="First">A120</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6- to 1.7-times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Lurasidone hydrochloride is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients, and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1,000 patients treated are provided in Table 2.</p><p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Risk Differences of the Number of Cases of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Age Range</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1,000 Patients Treated</span></p><p class="First">Increases Compared to Placebo</p><p class="First">&lt; 18</p><p class="First">14 additional patients</p><p class="First">18 to 24</p><p class="First">5 additional patients</p><p class="First">Decreases Compared to Placebo</p><p class="First">25 to 64</p><p class="First">1 fewer patient</p><p class="First">≥ 65</p><p class="First">6 fewer patients</p><p>It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients extends to longer-term use, i.e. beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression.</p><p>Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing lurasidone hydrochloride, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</h3><p class="First">In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. Lurasidone hydrochloride is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</h3><p class="First">A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including lurasidone hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.</p><p>If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue lurasidone hydrochloride and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring.</p><h3>Tardive Dyskinesia</h3><p class="First">Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements that can develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</p><p>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>The syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</p><p>Given these considerations, lurasidone hydrochloride should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</p><p>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on lurasidone hydrochloride, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with lurasidone hydrochloride despite the presence of the syndrome.</p><h3>Metabolic Changes</h3><p class="First">Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus</span></span></p><p>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics.</p><p>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bipolar Depression</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Monotherapy</span></p><p>Data from the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study are presented in Table 4.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Change in Fasting Glucose in the Adult Monotherapy Bipolar Depression Study</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lurasidone Hydrochloride</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">20 to 60 mg/day</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">80 to 120 mg/day</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean Change from Baseline (mg/dL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">n=148</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">n=140</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">n=143</span></p><p class="First">Serum Glucose</p><p class="First">+1.8</p><p class="First">-0.8</p><p class="First">+1.8</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Proportion of Patients with Shifts to ≥ 126 mg/dL</span></p><p class="First">Serum Glucose<br/>

This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>.</p><p>Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer.

Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.</p><p>Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and lurasidone hydrochloride should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the absence of other causative factors.</p><p>Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,000/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) should discontinue lurasidone hydrochloride and have their WBC followed until recovery.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope</h3><p class="First">Lurasidone hydrochloride may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naïve. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.</p><p>Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: ≥ 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and ≥ 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bipolar Depression</span> <span class="Bold"><br/>
<br/>
Adults</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Monotherapy</span></p><p>In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.6% with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 mg to 60 mg and 0.6% with lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg to 120 mg compared to 0% with placebo.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate</span></p><p>In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression therapy studies, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 1.1% with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 mg to 120 mg compared to 0.9% with placebo.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric use information is approved for Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s Latuda<span class="Sup">®</span> (lurasidone hydrochloride) tablets. However, due to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</span></p><h3>Falls</h3><p class="First">Lurasidone hydrochloride may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">As with other antipsychotic drugs, lurasidone hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer’s dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bipolar Depression Monotherapy</span></p><p>In the adult 6-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, no patients experienced seizures/convulsions.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate</span></p><p>In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric use information is approved for Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s Latuda<span class="Sup">®</span> (lurasidone hydrochloride) tablets. However, due to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</span></p><h3>Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment</h3><p class="First">Lurasidone hydrochloride, like other antipsychotics, has the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with lurasidone hydrochloride does not affect them adversely.</p><p>In clinical studies with lurasidone hydrochloride, somnolence included: hypersomnia, hypersomnolence, sedation and somnolence.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bipolar Depression</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Monotherapy</span></p><p>In the adult short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, somnolence was reported by 7.3% (12/164) and 13.8% (23/167) with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 mg to 60 mg and 80 mg to 120 mg, respectively compared to 6.5% (11/168) of placebo patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate</span></p><p>In the adult short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, somnolence was reported by 11.4% (41/360) of patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 mg to 120 mg compared to 5.1% (17/334) of placebo patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric use information is approved for Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s Latuda<span class="Sup">®</span> (lurasidone hydrochloride) tablets. However, due to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.</span></p><h3>Body Temperature Dysregulation</h3><p class="First">Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing lurasidone hydrochloride for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h3>Activation of Mania/Hypomania</h3><p class="First">Antidepressant treatment can increase the risk of developing a manic or hypomanic episode, particularly in patients with bipolar disorder. Monitor patients for the emergence of such episodes.</p><p>In the adult bipolar depression monotherapy and adjunctive therapy (with lithium or valproate) studies, less than 1% of subjects in the lurasidone hydrochloride and placebo groups developed manic or hypomanic episodes.</p><h3>Dysphagia</h3><p class="First">Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer’s dementia. Lurasidone hydrochloride and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.</p><h3>Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson’s Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies</h3><p class="First">Patients with Parkinson’s Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

Greater exposure may increase the risk of lurasidone hydrochloride-associated adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Other Specific Populations</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment for lurasidone hydrochloride is required on the basis of a patient’s sex, race, or smoking status <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Lurasidone hydrochloride is not a controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Lurasidone hydrochloride has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse or physical dependence or its ability to induce tolerance. While clinical studies with lurasidone hydrochloride did not reveal any tendency for drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted and/or abused once it is marketed. Patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed carefully for signs of lurasidone hydrochloride misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, drug-seeking behavior, increases in dose).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Human Experience</h3><p class="First">In premarketing clinical studies, accidental or intentional overdosage of lurasidone hydrochloride was identified in one patient who ingested an estimated 560 mg of lurasidone hydrochloride. This patient recovered without sequelae. This patient resumed lurasidone hydrochloride treatment for an additional two months.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">No specific antidotes for lurasidone hydrochloride are known. In managing overdose, provide supportive care, including close medical supervision and monitoring, and consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. If an overdose occurs, consult a Certified Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222 or <span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">www.poison.org</span></span>).</p><p>Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QT-prolonging effects when administered in patients with an acute overdose of lurasidone hydrochloride. Similarly, the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of lurasidone hydrochloride, resulting in problematic hypotension.</p><p>Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures. Epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, or other sympathomimetics with beta-agonist activity, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of lurasidone hydrochloride-induced alpha blockade. In case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered.</p><p>Gastric lavage (after intubation if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered.</p><p>The possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis.</p><h2>Lurasidone Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Lurasidone hydrochloride is an atypical antipsychotic belonging to the chemical class of benzisothiazol derivatives.</p><p>Its chemical name is (3a<span class="Italics">R</span>,4<span class="Italics">S</span>,7<span class="Italics">R</span>,7a<span class="Italics">S</span>)-2-{(1<span class="Italics">R</span>,2<span class="Italics">R</span>)-2-[4-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3-yl)piperazin-1-ylmethyl] cyclohexylmethyl}hexahydro-4,7-methano-2<span class="Italics">H</span>-isoindole-1,3-dione hydrochloride.

It is very slightly soluble in water, practically insoluble or insoluble in 0.1 N hydrochloride, slightly soluble in ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol, practically insoluble or insoluble in toluene and very slightly soluble in acetone.</p><p>Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets are intended for oral administration only. Each tablet contains 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, or 120 mg of lurasidone hydrochloride.</p><p>Inactive ingredients are: corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, methacrylic acid copolymer Type C, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol part hydrolyzed, sodium bicarbonate, talc and titanium dioxide. Additionally, the 80 mg tablet contains FD&amp;C Blue No. 2 aluminum lake and iron oxide yellow.<br/></p><h2>Lurasidone Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of lurasidone in the treatment of bipolar depression is unclear. However, its efficacy in bipolar depression could be mediated through a combination of central dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> and serotonin Type 2 (5HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>) receptor antagonism.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Lurasidone is an antagonist with high affinity binding at the dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptors (Ki of 1 nM) and the serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span> (Ki of 0.5 nM) and 5-HT<span class="Sub">7</span> (Ki of 0.5 nM) receptors. It also binds with moderate affinity to the human α<span class="Sub">2C</span> adrenergic receptors (Ki of 11 nM), is a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span> (Ki of 6.4 nM) receptors, and is an antagonist at the α<span class="Sub">2A</span> adrenergic receptors (Ki of 41 nM). Lurasidone exhibits little or no affinity for histamine H<span class="Sub">1</span> and muscarinic M<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors (IC<span class="Sub">50</span> &gt; 1,000 nM).</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">ECG Changes</span></span></p><p>The effects of lurasidone hydrochloride on the QTc interval were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-dedicated thorough QT study in 43 patients with another indication, who were treated with lurasidone hydrochloride doses of 120 mg daily, 600 mg daily and completed the study. The maximum mean (upper 1-sided, 95% CI) increase in baseline-adjusted QTc intervals based on individual correction method (QTcI) was 7.5 (11.7) ms and 4.6 (9.5) ms, for the 120 mg and 600 mg dose groups respectively, observed at 2 to 4 hours after dosing. In this study, there was no apparent dose (exposure)-response relationship.<br/>
<br/>
In short-term, placebo-controlled studies in bipolar depression and another indication, no post- baseline QT prolongations exceeding 500 msec were reported in patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride tablets or placebo.<br/></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adults</span></span></p><p>The activity of lurasidone hydrochloride is primarily due to the parent drug. The pharmacokinetics of lurasidone hydrochloride is dose-proportional within a total daily dose range of 20 mg to 160 mg. Steady-state concentrations of lurasidone hydrochloride are reached within 7 days of starting lurasidone hydrochloride.</p><p>Following administration of 40 mg of lurasidone hydrochloride, the mean (% CV) elimination half-life was 18 (7) hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption and Distribution:</span> Lurasidone hydrochloride is absorbed and reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 1 to 3 hours. It is estimated that 9% to 19% of an administered dose is absorbed. Following administration of 40 mg of lurasidone hydrochloride, the mean (%CV) apparent volume of distribution was 6173 (17.2) L. Lurasidone hydrochloride is highly bound (~99%) to serum proteins.</p><p>In a food effect study, lurasidone hydrochloride mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were about 3-times and 2-times, respectively, when administered with food compared to the levels observed under fasting conditions. Lurasidone hydrochloride exposure was not affected as meal size was increased from 350 to 1,000 calories and was independent of meal fat content <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p>In clinical studies, establishing the safety and efficacy of lurasidone hydrochloride, patients were instructed to take their daily dose with food <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Elimination:</span> Lurasidone hydrochloride is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4. The major biotransformation pathways are oxidative <span class="Italics">N</span>-dealkylation, hydroxylation of norbornane ring, and <span class="Italics">S</span>-oxidation. Lurasidone hydrochloride is metabolized into two active metabolites (ID-14283 and ID-14326) and two major non-active metabolites (ID-20219 and ID-20220). Based on <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies, lurasidone hydrochloride is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP4A11, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP2E1 enzymes. Because lurasidone hydrochloride is not a substrate for CYP1A2, smoking is not expected to have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of lurasidone hydrochloride.</p><p><span class="Italics">Transporter proteins: In vitro</span> studies suggest lurasidone hydrochloride is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, however, is probably a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that lurasidone hydrochloride is not expected to inhibit transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations. Lurasidone hydrochloride is not a clinically significant inhibitor of P-gp. However, it may inhibit BCRP.</p><p>Total excretion of radioactivity in urine and feces combined was approximately 89%, with about 80% recovered in feces and 9% recovered in urine, after a single dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-labeled lurasidone hydrochloride.</p><p>Following administration of 40 mg of lurasidone hydrochloride, the mean (% CV) apparent clearance was 3,902 (18.0) mL/min.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>Effects of other drugs on the exposure of lurasidone are summarized in Figure 1.
