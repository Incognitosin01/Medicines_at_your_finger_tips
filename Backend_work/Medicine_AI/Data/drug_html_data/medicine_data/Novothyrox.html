</ul><h2>Novothyrox Description</h2><p class="First">Novothyrox (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) contains synthetic crystalline L-3, 3’,5,5’-tetraiodothyronine sodium salt [levothyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>) sodium]. Synthetic T<span class="Sub">4</span> is identical to that produced in the human thyroid gland. Levothyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>) sodium has an empirical formula of C<span class="Sub">15</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>I<span class="Sub">4</span>NNaO<span class="Sub">4</span> • H<span class="Sub">2</span>O, molecular weight of 798.86 g/mol (anhydrous), and structural formula as shown:</p><h3>Inactive Ingredients</h3><p class="First">Novothyrox (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) contain the following inactive ingredients: corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, gelatin, lactose monohydrate, and magnesium stearate. All strengths of Novothyrox tablets are formulated without color additives for patients who are sensitive to dyes.</p><h2>Novothyrox - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) released from the hypothalamus stimulates secretion of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone, TSH, from the anterior pituitary. TSH, in turn, is the physiologic stimulus for the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones, L-thyroxine (T<span class="Sub">4</span>) and L-triiodothyronine (T<span class="Sub">3</span>), by the thyroid gland. Circulating serum T<span class="Sub">3</span> and T<span class="Sub">4</span> levels exert a feedback effect on both TRH and TSH secretion. When serum T<span class="Sub">3</span> and T<span class="Sub">4</span> levels increase, TRH and TSH secretion decrease. When thyroid hormone levels decrease, TRH and TSH secretion increase.</p><p>The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions are not completely understood, but it is thought that their principal effects are exerted through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. T<span class="Sub">3</span> and T<span class="Sub">4</span> diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins.</p><p>Thyroid hormones regulate multiple metabolic processes and play an essential role in normal growth and development, and normal maturation of the central nervous system and bone. The metabolic actions of thyroid hormones include augmentation of cellular respiration and thermogenesis, as well as metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. The protein anabolic effects of thyroid hormones are essential to normal growth and development.</p><p>The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T<span class="Sub">3</span>, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T<span class="Sub">4</span> by deiodination in peripheral tissues.</p><p>Levothyroxine, at doses individualized according to patient response, is effective as replacement or supplemental therapy in hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis.</p><p>Levothyroxine is also effective in the suppression of pituitary TSH secretion in the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters, including thyroid nodules, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, multinodular goiter and, as adjunctive therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer (see <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE, PRECAUTIONS</span>, and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h2>PHARMACOKINETICS</h2><h3>Absorption</h3><p class="First">Absorption of orally administered T<span class="Sub">4</span> from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract ranges from 40% to 80%. The majority of the levothyroxine dose is absorbed from the jejunum and upper ileum. The relative bioavailability of Novothyrox tablets, compared to an equal nominal dose of oral levothyroxine sodium solution, is approximately 99%. T<span class="Sub">4</span> absorption is increased by fasting, and decreased in malabsorption syndromes and by certain foods such as soybean infant formula. Dietary fiber decreases bioavailability of T<span class="Sub">4</span>. Absorption may also decrease with age. In addition, many drugs and foods affect T<span class="Sub">4</span> absorption (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span> and <span class="Bold">Drug-Food Interactions</span>).</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p class="First">Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxinebinding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T<span class="Sub">4</span> partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half-life of T<span class="Sub">4</span> compared to T<span class="Sub">3</span>. Proteinbound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span> and <span class="Bold">Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</span>). Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy</span>).</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p class="First">T<span class="Sub">4</span> is slowly eliminated (see <span class="Bold">Table 1</span>). The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately eighty-percent of circulating T<span class="Sub">3</span> is derived from peripheral T<span class="Sub">4</span> by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T<span class="Sub">4</span> and T<span class="Sub">3</span>, with T<span class="Sub">4</span> deiodination also occurring at a number of additional sites, including the kidney and other tissues. Approximately 80% of the daily dose of T<span class="Sub">4</span> is deiodinated to yield equal amounts of T<span class="Sub">3</span> and reverse T<span class="Sub">3</span> (rT<span class="Sub">3</span>). T<span class="Sub">3</span> and rT<span class="Sub">3</span> are further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation.</p><h3>Elimination</h3><p class="First">Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. Approximately 20% of T<span class="Sub">4</span> is eliminated in the stool. Urinary excretion of T<span class="Sub">4</span> decreases with age.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Novothyrox</h2><p class="First">Levothyroxine sodium is used for the following indications:</p><h3>Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First">As replacement or supplemental therapy in congenital or acquired hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis. Specific indications include: primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism may result from functional deficiency, primary atrophy, partial or total congenital absence of the thyroid gland, or from the effects of surgery, radiation, or drugs, with or without the presence of goiter.</p><h3>Pituitary TSH Suppression</h3><p class="First">In the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>), including thyroid nodules (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>), subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), multinodular goiter (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>) and, as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Levothyroxine is contraindicated in patients with untreated subclinical (suppressed serum TSH level with normal T<span class="Sub">3</span> and T<span class="Sub">4</span> levels) or overt thyrotoxicosis of any etiology and in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Levothyroxine is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected adrenal insufficiency since thyroid hormones may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis by increasing the metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Novothyrox is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of the inactive ingredients in Novothyrox tablets. (See <span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span>, <span class="Bold">Inactive Ingredients.</span>)</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING: Thyroid hormones, including Novothyrox, either alone or with other therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment of obesity or for weight loss. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.</span></p><p class="First">Levothyroxine sodium should not be used in the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is associated with hypothyroidism.</p><p>In patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease, particularly the elderly or those with underlying cardiovascular disease, levothyroxine sodium therapy is contraindicated if the serum TSH level is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). If the serum TSH level is not suppressed, Novothyrox should be used with caution in conjunction with careful monitoring of thyroid function for evidence of hyperthyroidism and clinical monitoring for potential associated adverse cardiovascular signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Levothyroxine has a narrow therapeutic index. Regardless of the indication for use, careful dosage titration is necessary to avoid the consequences of over- or under-treatment. These consequences include, among others, effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Many drugs interact with levothyroxine sodium, necessitating adjustments in dosing to maintain therapeutic response (see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>).</p><h3>Effects on Bone Mineral Density</h3><p class="First">In women, long-term levothyroxine sodium therapy has been associated with increased bone resorption, thereby decreasing bone mineral density, especially in post-menopausal women on greater than replacement doses or in women who are receiving suppressive doses of levothyroxine sodium. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Therefore, it is recommended that patients receiving levothyroxine sodium be given the minimum dose necessary to achieve the desired clinical and biochemical response.</p><h3>Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease</h3><p class="First">Exercise caution when administering levothyroxine to patients with cardiovascular disorders and to the elderly in whom there is an increased risk of occult cardiac disease. In these patients, levothyroxine therapy should be initiated at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>; <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span>; and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, the levothyroxine dose should be reduced or withheld for one week and then cautiously restarted at a lower dose. Overtreatment with levothyroxine sodium may have adverse cardiovascular effects such as an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias. Patients with coronary artery disease who are receiving levothyroxine therapy should be monitored closely during surgical procedures, since the possibility of precipitating cardiac arrhythmias may be greater in those treated with levothyroxine. Concomitant administration of levothyroxine and sympathomimetic agents to patients with coronary artery disease may precipitate coronary insufficiency.</p><h3>Patients with Nontoxic Diffuse Goiter or Nodular Thyroid Disease</h3><p class="First">Exercise caution when administering levothyroxine to patients with nontoxic diffuse goiter or nodular thyroid disease in order to prevent precipitation of thyrotoxicosis (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). If the serum TSH is already suppressed, levothyroxine sodium should not be administered (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><h3>Associated Endocrine Disorders</h3><p class="First">HYPOTHALAMIC/PITUITARY HORMONE DEFICIENCIES</p><p>In patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, additional hypothalamic/pituitary hormone deficiencies should be considered, and, if diagnosed, treated (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, AUTOIMMUNE POLYGLANDULAR SYNDROME for adrenal insufficiency).</p><p>AUTOIMMUNE POLYGLANDULAR SYNDROME</p><p>Occasionally, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis may occur in association with other autoimmune disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, pernicious anemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency should be treated with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of treatment with levothyroxine sodium. Failure to do so may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis when thyroid hormone therapy is initiated, due to increased metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids by thyroid hormone. Patients with diabetes mellitus may require upward adjustments of their antidiabetic therapeutic regimens when treated with levothyroxine (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>).</p><h3>Other Associated Medical Conditions</h3><p class="First">Infants with congenital hypothyroidism appear to be at increased risk for other congenital anomalies, with cardiovascular anomalies (pulmonary stenosis, atrial septal defect, and ventricular septal defect) being the most common association.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be informed of the following information to aid in the safe and effective use of Novothyrox:</p><p>1. Notify your physician if you are allergic to any foods or medicines, are pregnant or intend to become pregnant, are breast-feeding, or are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations.</p><p>2. Notify your physician of any other medical conditions you may have, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems. Your dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while you are taking Novothyrox. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood and/or urinary glucose levels as directed by your physician and immediately report any changes to your physician. If you are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), your clotting status should be checked frequently.</p><p>3. Use Novothyrox only as prescribed by your physician. Do not discontinue or change the amount you take or how often you take it, unless directed to do so by your physician.</p><p>4. The levothyroxine in Novothyrox is intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by your thyroid gland. Generally, replacement therapy is to be taken for life, except in cases of transient hypothyroidism, which is usually associated with an inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis).</p><p>5. Take Novothyrox as a single dose, preferably on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast. Levothyroxine absorption is increased on an empty stomach.</p><p>6. It may take several weeks before you notice an improvement in your symptoms.</p><p>7. Notify your physician if you experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event.</p><p>8. Notify your physician if you become pregnant while taking Novothyrox. It is likely that your dose of Novothyrox will need to be increased while you are pregnant.</p><p>9. Notify your physician or dentist that you are taking Novothyrox prior to any surgery.</p><p>10. Partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of Novothyrox therapy, but this is usually temporary.</p><p>11. Novothyrox should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program.</p><p>12. Keep Novothyrox out of the reach of children. Store Novothyrox away from heat, moisture, and light.</p><p>13. Agents such as iron and calcium supplements and antacids can decrease the absorption of levothyroxine tablets. Therefore, levothyroxine sodium tablets should not be administered within 4 hours of these agents.</p><p>14. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">GENERAL</p><p>The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is confirmed by measuring TSH levels using a sensitive assay (second generation assay sensitivity ≤ 0.1 mIU/L or third generation assay sensitivity ≤ 0.01 mIU/L) and measurement of free-T<span class="Sub">4</span>.</p><p>The adequacy of therapy is determined by periodic assessment of appropriate laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. The choice of laboratory tests depends on various factors including the etiology of the underlying thyroid disease, the presence of concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, and the use of concomitant medications (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span> and <span class="Bold">Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</span>). Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Novothyrox may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or decreased T<span class="Sub">4</span> potency of the drug product.</p><p>ADULTS</p><p>In adult patients with primary (thyroidal) hypothyroidism, serum TSH levels (using a sensitive assay) alone may be used to monitor therapy. The frequency of TSH monitoring during levothyroxine dose titration depends on the clinical situation but it is generally recommended at 6-8 week intervals until normalization. For patients who have recently initiated levothyroxine therapy and whose serum TSH has normalized, or in patients who have had their dosage of levothyroxine changed, the serum TSH concentration should be measured after 8-12 weeks. When the optimum replacement dose has been attained, clinical (physical examination) and biochemical monitoring may be performed every 6-12 months, depending on the clinical situation, and whenever there is a change in the patient’s status. It is recommended that a physical examination and a serum TSH measurement be performed at least annually in patients receiving Novothyrox (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS</span>, and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>PEDIATRICS</p><p>In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, the adequacy of replacement therapy should be assessed by measuring both serum TSH (using a sensitive assay) and total- or free-T<span class="Sub">4</span>. During the first three years of life, the serum total- or free-T<span class="Sub">4</span> should be maintained at all times in the upper half of the normal range. While the aim of therapy is to also normalize the serum TSH level, this is not always possible in a small percentage of patients, particularly in the first few months of therapy. TSH may not normalize due to a resetting of the pituitary-thyroid feedback threshold as a result of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> hypothyroidism. Failure of the serum T<span class="Sub">4</span> to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of Novothyrox therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mU/L within 4 weeks should alert the physician to the possibility that the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Careful inquiry should then be made regarding compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to raising the dose of Novothyrox.</p><p>The recommended frequency of monitoring of TSH and total- or free-T<span class="Sub">4</span> in children is as follows: at 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment; every 1-2 months during the first year of life; every 2-3 months between 1 and 3 years of age; and every 3 to 12 months thereafter until growth is completed. More frequent intervals of monitoring may be necessary if poor compliance is suspected or abnormal values are obtained. It is recommended that TSH and T<span class="Sub">4</span> levels, and a physical examination, if indicated, be performed 2 weeks after any change in Novothyrox dosage. Routine clinical examination, including assessment of mental and physical growth and development, and bone maturation, should be performed at regular intervals (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</span>, and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>SECONDARY (PITUITARY) AND TERTIARY (HYPOTHALAMIC) HYPOTHYROIDISM</p><p>Adequacy of therapy should be assessed by measuring serum free-T<span class="Sub">4</span> levels, which should be maintained in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Many drugs affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to Novothyrox. In addition, thyroid hormones and thyroid status have varied effects on the pharmacokinetics and actions of other drugs. A listing of drug-thyroidal axis interactions is contained in Table 2.</p><p>The list of drug-thyroidal axis interactions in Table 2 may not be comprehensive due to the introduction of new drugs that interact with the thyroidal axis or the discovery of previously unknown interactions. The prescriber should be aware of this fact and should consult appropriate reference sources (e.g., package inserts of newly approved drugs, medical literature) for additional information if a drug-drug interaction with levothyroxine is suspected.</p><p class="First">Dopamine/Dopamine</p><p>Agonists</p><p>Glucocorticoids</p><p class="First">Use of these agents may result in a transient reduction in TSH secretion when administered at the following doses: Dopamine (≥ 1 mcg/kg/min);</p><p class="First">Aminoglutethimide</p><p>Amiodarone Iodide (including iodine-</p><p>containing Radiographic</p><p>contrast agents)</p><p>Lithium</p><p>Methimazole</p><p>Propylthiouracil (PTU)</p><p>Sulfonamides</p><p class="First">Amiodarone</p><p class="First">Antacids</p><p>- Aluminum &amp;</p><p>Magnesium Hydroxides</p><p>- Simethicone</p><p>Bile Acid Sequestrants</p><p>- Cholestyramine</p><p>- Colestipol</p><p>Calcium Carbonate</p><p>Cation Exchange Resins</p><p>- Kayexalate</p><p>Ferrous Sulfate</p><p>Orlistat</p><p class="First">Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of levothyroxine by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism.</p><p class="First">Clofibrate</p><p>Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives</p><p>Estrogens (oral)</p><p>Heroin/Methadone</p><p>5-Fluorouracil</p><p>Mitotane</p><p class="First">Androgens/Anabolic Steroids</p><p>Asparaginase</p><p>Glucocorticoids</p><p class="First">Furosemide (&gt; 80 mg IV)</p><p>Heparin</p><p>Hydantoins</p><p>Non-Steroidal Anti-</p><p>Inflammatory Drugs</p><p>- Fenamates</p><p>- Phenylbutazone</p><p class="First">Carbamazepine</p><p>Hydantoins</p><p>Phenobarbital</p><p class="First">Amiodarone</p><p>Beta-adrenergic antagonists</p><p>- (e.g., Propranolol</p><p>&gt; 160 mg/day)</p><p>Glucocorticoids</p><p>- (e.g., Dexamethasone</p><p>≥ 4 mg/day)</p><p class="First">Anticoagulants (oral)</p><p>- Coumarin Derivatives</p><p class="First">Thyroid hormones appear to increase the catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, thereby increasing the anticoagulant activity of oral anticoagulants.

Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the Novothyrox dose is increased. Prothrombin time should be closely monitored to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments (see <span class="Bold">Table 2</span>).</p><p>DIGITALIS GLYCOSIDES</p><p>The therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides may be reduced by levothyroxine. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides (see <span class="Bold">Table 2</span>).</p><h3>Drug-Food Interactions</h3><p class="First">Consumption of certain foods may affect levothyroxine absorption thereby necessitating adjustments in dosing. Soybean flour (infant formula), cotton seed meal, walnuts, and dietary fiber may bind and decrease the absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the GI tract.</p><h3>Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Changes in TBG concentration must be considered when interpreting T<span class="Sub">4</span> and T<span class="Sub">3</span> values, which necessitates measurement and evaluation of unbound (free) hormone and/or determination of the free-T<span class="Sub">4</span> index (FT<span class="Sub">4</span>I). Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increases TBG concentrations. Decreases in TBG concentrations are observed in nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy (see also <span class="Bold">Table 2</span>). Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility of levothyroxine. The synthetic T<span class="Sub">4</span> in Novothyrox is identical to that produced naturally by the human thyroid gland. Although there has been a reported association between prolonged thyroid hormone therapy and breast cancer, this has not been confirmed. Patients receiving Novothyrox for appropriate clinical indications should be titrated to the lowest effective replacement dose.</p><h3>Pregnancy-Category A</h3><p class="First">Studies in women taking levothyroxine sodium during pregnancy have not shown an increased risk of congenital abnormalities. Therefore, the possibility of fetal harm appears remote. Novothyrox should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated.</p><p>Hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth and premature delivery. Maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal and childhood growth and development. During pregnancy, serum T<span class="Sub">4</span> levels may decrease and serum TSH levels increase to values outside the normal range. Since elevations in serum TSH may occur as early as 4 weeks gestation, pregnant women taking Novothyrox should have their TSH measured during each trimester. An elevated serum TSH level should be corrected by an increase in the dose of Novothyrox. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the Novothyrox dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery. A serum TSH level should be obtained 6-8 weeks postpartum.</p><p>Thyroid hormones cross the placental barrier to some extent as evidenced by levels in cord blood of athyreotic fetuses being approximately one-third maternal levels. Transfer of thyroid hormone from the mother to the fetus, however, may not be adequate to prevent <span class="Italics">in utero</span> hypothyroidism.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Although thyroid hormones are excreted only minimally in human milk, caution should be exercised when Novothyrox is administered to a nursing woman. However, adequate replacement doses of levothyroxine are generally needed to maintain normal lactation.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">GENERAL</p><p>The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.</p><p>The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>, <span class="Bold">Table 3</span>). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient’s clinical and laboratory parameters (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests)</span>.</p><p>In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T<span class="Sub">4</span> and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T<span class="Sub">4</span> is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T<span class="Sub">4</span> and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.</p><p>Since some more severely affected children may become clinically hypothyroid when treatment is discontinued for 30 days, an alternate approach is to reduce the replacement dose of levothyroxine by half during the 30-day trial period. If, after 30 days, the serum TSH is elevated above 20 mU/L, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed, and full replacement therapy should be resumed. However, if the serum TSH has not risen to greater than 20 mU/L, levothyroxine treatment should be discontinued for another 30-day trial period followed by repeat serum T<span class="Sub">4</span> and TSH testing.</p><p>The presence of concomitant medical conditions should be considered in certain clinical circumstances and, if present, appropriately treated (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p>CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>)</p><p>Rapid restoration of normal serum T<span class="Sub">4</span> concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, Novothyrox therapy should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis and is generally continued for life.</p><p>During the first 2 weeks of Novothyrox therapy, infants should be closely monitored for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.</p><p>The patient should be monitored closely to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment has been associated with craniosynostosis in infants, and may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation and accelerate the bone age, with resultant premature closure of the epiphyses and compromised adult stature.</p><p>ACQUIRED HYPOTHYROIDISM IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS</p><p>The patient should be monitored closely to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.</p><p>Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, levothyroxine therapy should not be initiated at the full replacement dose (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS</span>, and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions associated with levothyroxine therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">OVERDOSAGE</span>). They include the following:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">General:</span></span> fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Central nervous system:</span></span> headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span></span> tremors, muscle weakness;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span></span> palpitations, tachycardia, arrythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span></span> dyspnea;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span></span> diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and elevations in liver function tests;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Dermatologic:</span></span> hair loss, flushing;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Endocrine:</span></span> decreased bone mineral density;</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Reproductive:</span></span> menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility.</p><p>Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised adult height.</p><p>Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy.</p><p>Inadequate levothyroxine dosage will produce or fail to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.</p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various GI symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to levothyroxine itself is not known to occur.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The signs and symptoms of overdosage are those of hyperthyroidism (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>). In addition, confusion and disorientation may occur. Cerebral embolism, shock, coma, and death have been reported. Seizures have occurred in a child ingesting approximately 18 mg of levothyroxine. Symptoms may not necessarily be evident or may not appear until several days after ingestion of levothyroxine sodium.</p><h3>Treatment of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Levothyroxine sodium should be reduced in dose or temporarily discontinued if signs or symptoms of overdosage occur.</p><h3>Acute Massive Overdosage</h3><p class="First">This may be a life-threatening emergency, therefore, symptomatic and supportive therapy should be instituted immediately. If not contraindicated (e.g., by seizures, coma, or loss of the gag reflex), the stomach should be emptied by emesis or gastric lavage to decrease gastrointestinal absorption. Activated charcoal or cholestyramine may also be used to decrease absorption. Central and peripheral increased sympathetic activity may be treated by administering β-receptor antagonists, e.g., propranolol, provided that there are no medical contraindications to their use. Provide respiratory support as needed; control congestive heart failure and arrhythmia; control fever, hypoglycemia, and fluid loss as necessary. Large doses of antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole or propylthiouracil) followed in one to two hours by large doses of iodine may be given to inhibit synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. Glucocorticoids may be given to inhibit the conversion of T<span class="Sub">4</span> to T<span class="Sub">3</span>. Plasmapheresis, charcoal hemoperfusion and exchange transfusion have been reserved for cases in which continued clinical deterioration occurs despite conventional therapy. Because T<span class="Sub">4</span> is highly protein bound, very little drug will be removed by dialysis.</p><h2>Novothyrox Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Principles</h3><p class="First">The goal of replacement therapy is to achieve and maintain a clinical and biochemical euthyroid state. The goal of suppressive therapy is to inhibit growth and/or function of abnormal thyroid tissue. The dose of Novothyrox that is adequate to achieve these goals depends on a variety of factors including the patient’s age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, concomitant medications, and the specific nature of the condition being treated (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Hence, the following recommendations serve only as dosing guidelines. Dosing must be individualized and adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient’s clinical response and laboratory parameters (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span>).</p><p>Novothyrox is administered as a single daily dose, preferably one-half to one hour before breakfast. Novothyrox should be taken at least 4 hours apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p>Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, the peak therapeutic effect at a given dose of levothyroxine sodium may not be attained for 4-6 weeks.</p><p>Caution should be exercised when administering Novothyrox to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><h3>Specific Patient Populations</h3><p class="First">HYPOTHYROIDISM IN ADULTS AND IN CHILDREN IN WHOM GROWTH AND PUBERTY ARE COMPLETE (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests</span>)</p><p>Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., <span class="Bold">100-125 mcg/day</span> for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.</p><p>For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of <span class="Bold">25-50 mcg/day</span> of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6-8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is <span class="Bold">12.5-25 mcg/day</span>, with gradual dose increments at 4-6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5-25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.</p><p>In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is <span class="Bold">12.5-25 mcg/day</span> with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2-4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.</p><p>In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T<span class="Sub">4</span> level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.</p><p>PEDIATRIC DOSAGE – CONGENITAL OR ACQUIRED HYPOTHYROIDISM (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span>)</p><p><span class="Italics">General Principles</span></p><p>In general, levothyroxine therapy should be instituted at full replacement doses as soon as possible. Delays in diagnosis and institution of therapy may have deleterious effects on the child’s intellectual and physical growth and development.</p><p>Undertreatment and overtreatment should be avoided (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span>).</p><p>Novothyrox may be administered to infants and children who cannot swallow intact tablets by crushing the tablet and suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5-10 mL or 1-2 teaspoons) of water. This suspension can be administered by spoon or dropper. <span class="Bold">DO NOT STORE THE SUSPENSION</span>. Foods that decrease absorption of levothyroxine, such as soybean infant formula, should not be used for administering levothyroxine sodium tablets (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">Drug-Food Interactions</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics">Newborns</span></p><p>The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is <span class="Bold">10-15 mcg/kg/day</span>. A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg/day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4-6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment. In infants with very low (&lt; 5 mcg/dL) or undetectable serum T<span class="Sub">4</span> concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is <span class="Bold">50 mcg/day</span> of levothyroxine sodium.</p><p><span class="Italics">Infants and Children</span></p><p>Levothyroxine therapy is usually initiated at full replacement doses, with the recommended dose per body weight decreasing with age (see <span class="Bold">Table 3</span>). However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of <span class="Bold">25 mcg/day</span> of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2-4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.</p><p>Hyperactivity in an older child can be minimized if the starting dose is one-fourth of the recommended full replacement dose, and the dose is then increased on a weekly basis by an amount equal to one-fourth the full-recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy</span></p><p>Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine requirements (see <span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics">Subclinical Hypothyroidism</span></p><p>If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., <span class="Bold">1 mcg/kg/day</span>) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level. Patients who are not treated should be monitored yearly for changes in clinical status and thyroid laboratory parameters.</p><p><span class="Italics">TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Thyroid Nodules</span></p><p>The target level for TSH suppression in these conditions has not been established with controlled studies. In addition, the efficacy of TSH suppression for benign nodular disease is controversial. Therefore, the dose of Novothyrox used for TSH suppression should be individualized based on the specific disease and the patient being treated.</p><p>In the treatment of well-differentiated (papillary and follicular) thyroid cancer, levothyroxine is used as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Generally, TSH is suppressed to &lt;0.1 mU/L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of <span class="Bold">greater than 2 mcg/kg/day</span>. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be &lt;0.01 mU/L.</p><p>In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1 to either 0.5 or 1.0 mU/L) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Levothyroxine sodium is contraindicated if the serum TSH is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p><span class="Italics">Myxedema Coma</span></p><p>Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, oral thyroid hormone drug products are not recommended to treat this condition. Thyroid hormone drug products formulated for intravenous administration should be administered.</p><h2>How is Novothyrox Supplied</h2><p class="First">Novothyrox (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) are supplied as off-white, round tablets, that are flat on both sides with a beveled edge and a cross score on one side.
