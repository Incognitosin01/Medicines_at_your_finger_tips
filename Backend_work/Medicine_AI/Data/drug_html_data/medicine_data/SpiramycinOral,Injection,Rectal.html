It is often used to treat toxoplasmosis in pregnant women since spiramycin decreases the chance that the unborn baby will get the infection. Spiramycin may also be used for other problems as determined by your doctor. It will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Spiramycin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using spiramycin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For spiramycin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to spiramycin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Spiramycin has been tested in children and, in effective doses, has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of spiramycin in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.
