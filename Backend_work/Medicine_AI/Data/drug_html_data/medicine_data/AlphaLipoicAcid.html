Alpha-lipoic acid may have been combined with other plants or extracts in a specific preparation to treat these conditions.</p><p>Alpha-lipoic acid has also been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, alcoholic liver problems, altitude sickness, heart-related nerve problems, HIV-related brain problems, or eye problems caused by diabetes. However, research has shown that alpha-lipoic acid may not be effective in treating these conditions.</p><p>Other uses not proven with research have included treating glaucoma, migraine headaches, high blood pressure, heart failure, dementia, carpal tunnel syndrome, leg pain caused by sciatic nerve damage or peripheral artery disease (PAD), anti-aging of the skin, and other conditions.</p><p>It is not certain whether alpha-lipoic acid is effective in treating any medical condition.

There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs.
