It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.</p><p>Naproxen is used to treat pain or inflammation caused by conditions such as arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendinitis, bursitis, gout, or menstrual cramps. It can also be used to treat acute pain caused by other conditions not listed in this medication guide.</p><p>The delayed-release or extended-release tablets are slower-acting forms of naproxen that are used only for treating chronic conditions such as arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. These forms will not work fast enough to treat acute pain.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use naproxen if you have a history of allergic reaction to aspirin or other NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug).</p><p>Naproxen can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease. Even people without heart disease or risk factors could have a stroke or heart attack while taking this medicine.</p><p>Do not use this medicine just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have swelling of the face or throat, chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or problems with vision or balance. Stop taking naproxen and notify your physician if you notice stomach pain, tiredness or weakness, yellow skin or eyes, nausea, vomiting, bloody or black and sticky bowel movements, skin rash, unexplained weight loss or weight gain, or swelling of the hands and feet.</p><p>Naproxen may also cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. These conditions can occur without warning while you are using this medicine, especially in older adults.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Naproxen may also cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal.

Do not take this medicine in larger amounts or for longer than recommended. Use the lowest dose that is effective in treating your condition.</p><p>Shake the oral suspension (liquid) well just before you measure a dose. <b>Measure liquid medicine</b> with the dosing syringe provided, or with a special dose-measuring spoon or medicine cup.

Many medicines available over the counter contain aspirin, salicylates, or other medicines similar to naproxen (such as ibuprofen or ketoprofen). Taking certain products together can cause you to get too much of this type of medication.</p><p>Ask your doctor before using an antacid, and use only the type your doctor recommends. Some antacids can make it harder for your body to absorb naproxen.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Naproxen side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to naproxen:</b> wheezing or trouble breathing; hives; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of a heart attack or stroke:</b> chest pain spreading to your jaw or shoulder, sudden numbness or weakness on one side of the body, slurred speech, feeling short of breath.</p><p>Stop using naproxen and call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
