</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Imitrex Nasal Spray</h2><p class="First">Imitrex Nasal Spray is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><h2>Imitrex Nasal Spray Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended adult dose of Imitrex Nasal Spray for the acute treatment of migraine is 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg. The 20-mg dose may provide a greater effect than the 5-mg and 10-mg doses, but may have a greater risk of adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>The 5-mg and 20-mg doses are given as a single spray in 1 nostril. The 10-mg dose may be achieved by the administration of a single 5-mg dose in each nostril.</p><p>If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking Imitrex Nasal Spray, or returns after a transient improvement, 1 additional dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg in a 24-hour period.</p><p>The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30‑day period has not been established.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Unit dose nasal spray devices containing 5 mg or 20 mg sumatriptan.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Imitrex Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal’s Angina</h3><p class="First">The use of Imitrex Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of Imitrex Nasal Spray. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Imitrex Nasal Spray may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.</p><p>Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Imitrex Nasal Spray. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, Imitrex Nasal Spray is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of Imitrex Nasal Spray in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of Imitrex Nasal Spray. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of Imitrex Nasal Spray.</p><h3>Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Discontinue Imitrex Nasal Spray if these disturbances occur. Imitrex Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders.</p><h3>Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure</h3><p class="First">Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw may occur after treatment with Imitrex Nasal Spray and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of Imitrex Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina.</p><h3>Cerebrovascular Events</h3><p class="First">Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue Imitrex Nasal Spray if a cerebrovascular event occurs.</p><p>Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Imitrex Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.</p><h3>Other Vasospasm Reactions</h3><p class="First">Imitrex Nasal Spray may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before using additional Imitrex Nasal Spray.</p><p>Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5‑HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists has not been clearly established.</p><h3>Medication Overuse Headache</h3><p class="First">Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Serotonin syndrome may occur with Imitrex Nasal Spray, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4)]</span>. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue Imitrex Nasal Spray if serotonin syndrome is suspected.</p><h3>Increase in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMITREX. Imitrex Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.</p><h3>Local Irritation</h3><p class="First">Local irritative symptoms such as burning, numbness, paresthesia, discharge, and pain or soreness were reported in approximately 5% of patients in controlled clinical trials and were noted to be severe in about 1%. The symptoms were transient and generally resolved in less than 2 hours. Limited examinations of the nose and throat did not reveal any clinically noticeable injury in these patients. The consequences of extended and repeated use of Imitrex Nasal Spray on the nasal and/or respiratory mucosa have not been systematically evaluated in patients.</p><h3>Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving IMITREX. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Imitrex Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to IMITREX.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">Seizures have been reported following administration of IMITREX. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Imitrex Nasal Spray should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in worldwide placebo-controlled clinical trials in 3,419 patients with migraine. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 1% or more in the group treated with Imitrex Nasal Spray 20 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Percent of Patients Reporting</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IMITREX</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Nasal Spray</span></p><p><span class="Bold">5 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 496)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IMITREX</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Nasal Spray</span></p><p><span class="Bold">10 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 1,007)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IMITREX</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Nasal Spray</span></p><p><span class="Bold">20 mg</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 1,212)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 704)</span></p><p class="First">Atypical sensations</p><p class="First">   Burning sensation</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">1.4</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">Ear, nose, and throat</p><p class="First">   Disorder/discomfort of nasal<br/>

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of IMITREX tablets, Imitrex Nasal Spray, and IMITREX injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to IMITREX or a combination of these factors.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular</span></p><p>Hypotension, palpitations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Neurological</span></p><p>Dystonia, tremor.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Ergot-Containing Drugs</h3><p class="First">Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and Imitrex Nasal Spray within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by up to 7-fold. Therefore, the use of Imitrex Nasal Spray in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Other 5-HT1 Agonists</h3><p class="First">Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of Imitrex Nasal Spray and other 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.</p><h3>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk:</span> Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data:</span> The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group.</p><p>In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively.</p><p>Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of Imitrex Nasal Spray. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Imitrex Nasal Spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with Imitrex Nasal Spray.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Following subcutaneous administration of a 6-mg dose of IMITREX injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Imitrex Nasal Spray is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age.</p><p>Two controlled clinical trials evaluated Imitrex Nasal Spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of Imitrex Nasal Spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults.</p><p>Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral IMITREX (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral IMITREX compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents.</p><p>Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal IMITREX. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14‑year‑old male following the use of oral IMITREX; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal IMITREX are not presently available.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of Imitrex Nasal Spray did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Imitrex Nasal Spray <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In clinical trials, the highest single doses of Imitrex Nasal Spray administered without significant reactions were 40 mg to 12 volunteers and 40 mg to 85 subjects with migraine, which is twice the highest single recommended dose. In addition, 12 volunteers were administered a total daily dose of 60 mg (20 mg 3 times daily) for 3.5 days without significant adverse reactions.</p><p>Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation.</p><p>The elimination half‑life of sumatriptan is approximately 2 hours <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>, and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with Imitrex Nasal Spray should continue for at least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist.</p><p>It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan.</p><h2>Imitrex Nasal Spray Description</h2><p class="First">Imitrex Nasal Spray contains sumatriptan, a selective 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptor agonist. Sumatriptan is chemically designated as 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methyl-indole-5-methanesulfonamide, and it has the following structure:</p><p>The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>S, representing a molecular weight of 295.4. Sumatriptan is a white to off-white powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline.</p><p>Each Imitrex Nasal Spray contains 5 or 20 mg of sumatriptan in a 100-microL unit dose aqueous buffered solution containing monobasic potassium phosphate NF, anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate USP, sulfuric acid NF, sodium hydroxide NF, and purified water USP. The pH of the solution is approximately 5.5. The osmolality of the solution is 372 or 742 mOsmol for the 5- and 20-mg Imitrex Nasal Spray, respectively.</p><h2>Imitrex Nasal Spray - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5‑HT<span class="Sub">1B/1D</span> receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Blood Pressure</span></p><p>Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Peripheral (Small) Arteries</span></p><p>In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance.</p><p><span class="Bold">Heart Rate</span></p><p>Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan’s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>In a trial of 20 female volunteers, the mean maximum concentration following a 5- and 20-mg intranasal dose was 5 and 16 ng/mL, respectively. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> following a 6‑mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 25 mg and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. In a trial of 24 male volunteers, the bioavailability relative to subcutaneous injection was low, approximately 17%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption.</p><p>Clinical and pharmacokinetic data indicate that administration of two 5-mg doses, 1 dose in each nostril, is equivalent to administration of a single 10-mg dose in 1 nostril.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL, is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The elimination half-life of sumatriptan administered as a nasal spray is approximately 2 hours, similar to the half-life seen after subcutaneous injection. Only 3% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan; 42% of the dose is excreted as the major metabolite, the indole acetic acid analogue of sumatriptan. The total plasma clearance is approximately 1,200 mL/min.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Age:</span> The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Intranasal sumatriptan has not been evaluated for age differences.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment:</span> The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Hepatic Impairment:</span> The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of the intranasal formulation of sumatriptan has not been evaluated. Sumatriptan bioavailability following intranasal administration is 17%, similar to that after oral administration (15%). Following oral administration, an approximately 70% increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC was observed in one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8). Similar changes can be expected following intranasal administration.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of Imitrex Nasal Spray in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Racial Groups:</span> The systemic clearance and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects.

MAO inhibitors interaction studies have not been performed with intranasal sumatriptan.</p><p>Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. The effects of an MAO inhibitor on systemic exposure after intranasal sumatriptan would be expected to be greater than the effect after subcutaneous sumatriptan but smaller than the effect after oral sumatriptan because only swallowed drug would be subject to first-pass effects.</p><p>In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half‑life.</p><p>A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Xylometazoline:</span> An in vivo drug interaction trial indicated that 3 drops of xylometazoline (0.1% w/v), a decongestant, administered 15 minutes prior to a 20-mg nasal dose of sumatriptan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat in which sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, there was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration.</p><p>Carcinogenicity studies of sumatriptan using the nasal route have not been conducted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>When sumatriptan (5, 50, or 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both.</p><p>When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Fertility studies of sumatriptan using the intranasal route have not been conducted.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Corneal Opacities</span></p><p>Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60‑week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of Imitrex Nasal Spray in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 8 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, of which 5 used the recommended dosing regimen and used the marketed formulation. Patients enrolled in these 5 trials were predominately female (86%) and Caucasian (95%), with a mean age of 41 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 2 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of Imitrex Nasal Spray or other medication was allowed 2 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 10 and 20 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of 1 to 3 migraine attacks. Patients received doses as a single spray into 1 nostril. In 2 trials, a 5-mg dose was also evaluated.</p><p>In all 5 trials utilizing the market formulation and recommended dosage regimen, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving Imitrex Nasal Spray at all doses (with one exception) compared with those who received placebo. In 4 of the 5 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 hours in the 20-mg group when compared with the lower-dose groups (5 and 10 mg). There were no statistically significant differences between the 5- and 10-mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 5 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Note that, in general, comparisons of results obtained in trials conducted under different conditions by different investigators with different samples of patients are ordinarily unreliable for purposes of quantitative comparison.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IMITREX</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Nasal Spray</span></p><p><span class="Bold">5 mg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Imitrex Nasal Spray</span></p><p><span class="Bold">10 mg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">IMITREX</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Nasal Spray</span></p><p><span class="Bold">20 mg</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p class="First">Trial 1</p><p class="First">49%<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">46%<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">64%<span class="Sup">a,b,c</span></p><p class="First">25%</p><p class="First">(n = 121)</p><p class="First">(n = 112)</p><p class="First">(n = 118)</p><p class="First">(n = 63)</p><p class="First">Trial 2</p><p class="First">Not applicable</p><p class="First">44%<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">55%<span class="Sup">a,b</span></p><p class="First">25%</p><p class="First">(n = 273)</p><p class="First">(n = 277)</p><p class="First">(n = 138)</p><p class="First">Trial 3</p><p class="First">Not applicable</p><p class="First">54%<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">63%<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">35%</p><p class="First">(n = 106)</p><p class="First">(n = 202)</p><p class="First">(n = 100)</p><p class="First">Trial 4</p><p class="First">Not applicable</p><p class="First">43%</p><p class="First">62%<span class="Sup">a,b</span></p><p class="First">29%</p><p class="First">(n = 106)</p><p class="First">(n = 215)</p><p class="First">(n = 112)</p><p class="First">Trial 5<span class="Sup">d</span></p><p class="First">45%<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">53%<span class="Sup">a</span></p><p class="First">60%<span class="Sup">a,c</span></p><p class="First">36%</p><p class="First">(n = 296)</p><p class="First">(n = 291)</p><p class="First">(n = 286)</p><p class="First">(n = 198)</p><p><span class="Sup">a   </span><span class="Italics">P</span>&lt;0.05 in comparison with placebo.</p><p><span class="Sup">b   </span><span class="Italics">P</span>&lt;0.05 in comparison with 10 mg.</p><p><span class="Sup">c   </span><span class="Italics">P</span>&lt;0.05 in comparison with 5 mg.</p><p><span class="Sup">d   </span>Data are for attack 1 only of multi-attack trial for comparison.</p><p>The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response over the 2 hours following treatment is depicted in Figure 1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1.
