Carbidopa helps prevent the breakdown of levodopa before it can reach the brain and take effect.</p><p>Carbidopa and levodopa enteral (Duopa) is a combination medicine used to treat movement problems in people with advanced Parkinson's disease. Duopa reduces the "off time" effect associated with taking other medicines to treat Parkinson's symptoms.</p><p>Duopa is a gel form of carbidopa and levodopa that is infused directly into the small intestine.  Duopa is given with an infusion pump through a tube inserted into the wall of your stomach through a surgical incision called a "stoma" or a "port."</p><p>Carbidopa and levodopa may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Do not use carbidopa and levodopa if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days.

Your doctor will occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>You will need a surgical procedure to create your stoma. A special tube called a "PEG-J" tube, will be placed through the stoma and into your small intestine. This tube is attached to an infusion pump that will deliver Duopa into your body.</p><p>Duopa comes in a plastic cassette that is attached to the infusion pump. Your care provider will program the pump and show you how to use it. Read all patient information, medication guides, and instruction sheets provided to you. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Duopa is infused over a 16-hour period to help keep a steady amount of the drug in your body at all times. The infusion pump also allows extra doses if needed to reduce "off time" symptoms.</p><p>After the 16 hours, you may disconnect the pump and take a night-time dose of oral carbidopa and levodopa (tablets). You may also need to take the oral medicine if your pump is disconnected during the day for longer than 2 hours.</p><p>Your stoma and tube will need special care and cleaning. You must watch for signs of infection (redness, warmth, swelling). You must also keep the tube from getting kinked to assure that the medicine flows freely through it.</p><p>Do not stop using the medicine or change your dose without your doctor's advice.</p><p>This medicine can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using carbidopa and levodopa.</p><p>Each single-use Duopa cassette is for one 16-hour use. Throw away after one use.</p><p>Store cassettes in their original carton in the refrigerator, do not freeze.</p><p>Take a cassette out of the refrigerator 20 minutes before using it, to allow it to reach room temperature. Protect the cassette from light. <b>Do not use the cold cassette right after taking it out of the refrigerator.</b></p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p><b>You may need to use extra medicine to make up a missed dose.</b> Call your doctor for instructions if you stop your infusion or disconnect your pump for longer than 2 hours.</p><p>To avoid a missed dose, get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking carbidopa and levodopa?</h2><p>Some people using carbidopa and levodopa have fallen asleep during normal daytime activities such as working, talking, eating, or driving. <b>Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Duopa will affect you</b>. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents. Also avoid getting up too fast from a sitting or lying position, or you may feel dizzy. Get up slowly and steady yourself to prevent a fall.</p><p>Drinking alcohol with  Duopa can cause side effects.</p><p>Avoid taking iron supplements or eating a diet that is high in protein (protein sources include meat, eggs, and cheese). These things can make it harder for your body to digest and absorb carbidopa and levodopa.
