Management: Avoid combined use of benzoyl peroxide and topical isotretinoin. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, consider separating application times and monitoring for signs and symptoms of clinical failure of isotretinoin.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Multivitamins/Fluoride (with ADE): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Retinoic Acid Derivatives.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Multivitamins/Minerals (with ADEK, Folate, Iron): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Retinoic Acid Derivatives.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Multivitamins/Minerals (with AE, No Iron): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Retinoic Acid Derivatives.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Porfimer: Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Porfimer. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Verteporfin: Photosensitizing Agents may enhance the photosensitizing effect of Verteporfin. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Also see individual agents.</p><p>&gt;10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Local dryness (mild 10% to 41%; moderate 2% to 15%), stinging sensation of the skin (mild 7% to 41%; moderate 1% to 19%), localized erythema (mild 8% to 27%; moderate 2% to 20%)</p><p>Local: Local desquamation (mild 9% to 35%; moderate 1% to 17%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Xeroderma (14%), skin irritation (≤4%), contact dermatitis (3%), burning sensation of skin (≤2%), atopic dermatitis (1%), eczema (1%)</p><p>Local: Application site irritation (1%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Conjunctivitis, constriction of the pharynx, eyelid edema, facial swelling, pruritus, skin blister, skin discoloration, skin pain, skin rash, sunburn</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bleaching effects: May bleach hair or colored fabric.</p><p>• Photosensitivity: Use is associated with increased susceptibility/sensitivity to UV light; avoid sunlamps or excessive sunlight exposure. Daily sunscreen use and other protective measures (eg, hat) are recommended if sun exposure cannot be avoided.</p><p>• Skin irritation: Certain cutaneous signs and symptoms (eg, erythema, dryness, scaling, burning/stinging) may occur during treatment; these are most likely to occur during the first 4 weeks and usually lessen with continued use. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Use of moisturizer, decreased use, or discontinuation may be recommended.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Sulfone products: Concomitant use of benzoyl peroxide with sulfone products (eg, dapsone, sulfacetamide) may cause temporary discoloration (yellow/orange) of facial hair and skin. Application of products at separate times during the day or washing off benzoyl peroxide prior to application of other products may avoid skin discoloration (Dubina 2009).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For external use only; avoid contact with abraded skin, mucous membranes, and eyes. Do not apply to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. Avoid use of waxing as a depilatory method on treated skin. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
