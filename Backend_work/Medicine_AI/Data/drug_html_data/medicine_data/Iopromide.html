Do not administer through the same line as other medications or parenteral nutrition. May be administered simultaneously with saline when utilizing a power injector system. Hydrate patients prior to and following administration. Injection rates should be about equal to the flow rate in the vessel being injected. Allow sufficient time between each large injection.</p><p>May be a vesicant; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion; avoid infiltration.</p><p><b>Extravasation management:</b> If extravasation occurs, stop infusion immediately and disconnect; remove needle/cannula; elevate extremity. Aspiration of extravasated contrast media is not recommended (ACR 2018). Information conflicts regarding the use of hyaluronidase; the American College of Radiology (ACR) Manual on Contrast Media does not recommend hyaluronidase in the management of contrast media extravasation (ACR 2018); other sources suggest its utility in extravasation management (Bellin 2002; Reynolds 2014).</p><p><i>If using hyaluronidase:</i> Intradermal or SubQ: Inject a total of 1 to 1.7 mL (15 units/mL) as five separate 0.2 to 0.3 mL injections (using a 25-gauge needle) into area of extravasation at the leading edge in a clockwise manner (MacCara 1983; Reynolds 2014; Zenk 1981) or injection of a total of 5 mL (150 units/mL) as five separate 1 mL injections around the extravasation site has been also used successfully (Rowlett 2012).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). Protect from light. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: May enhance the potential for allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to Iodinated Contrast Agents.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>MetFORMIN: Iodinated Contrast Agents may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of MetFORMIN. Renal dysfunction that may be caused by iodinated contrast agents may lead to metformin-associated lactic acidosis.  Management: Management advice varies. Refer to the full drug interaction monograph content for details.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Sodium Iodide I131: Iodinated Contrast Agents may diminish the therapeutic effect of Sodium Iodide I131.  Management: Discontinue iodinated contrast agents before sodium iodide I-131 administration, and avoid concurrent use. Stop water soluble agents 2 months before, and stop lipophilic agents 6 months before, sodium iodide I-131 administration.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Test Interactions</h2><p>Thyroid function tests (which depend on estimates of iodine) will not accurately assess function for at least 16 days following administration of iodinated contrast agents. Iopromide may affect PTT, calcium thromboplastin time, and thrombin activity. It may activate the complement alternate pathway.

Use extreme caution in patients with a history of previous reaction to contrast dye or iodine and patients with a known allergic disorder (eg, bronchial asthma, hay fever, food allergies) or other hypersensitivities. Monitor closely during and for 30 to 60 minutes after administration (delayed reactions have occurred).</p><p>• Contrast-induced acute kidney injury: Acute kidney injury, including renal failure, may occur following intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media. Risk factors include patients with preexisting renal disease, advanced age, advanced vascular disease, heart failure, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of nephrotoxic agents or diuretics, multiple myeloma/paraproteinemia, or large doses or multiple doses of iodinated contrast media. Adequately hydrate patients prior to and following administration to minimize the risk.</p><p>• Dermatological effects: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS], toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN], acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis [AGEP], drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]) have occurred 1 hour to several weeks after administration; reaction severity may increase and time to onset may decrease with repeat administration. Avoid use in patients with a history of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction to iothalamate.</p><p>• Extravasation: May be a vesicant (higher osmolar contrast agents and/or higher volumes are associated with a higher risk); ensure proper needle/catheter/line placement prior to and during administration. Monitor infusion site. Avoid infiltration. Extravasation may result in tissue necrosis and/or compartment syndrome, particularly in patients with severe arterial or venous disease.</p><p>• Thromboembolic events: Serious thromboembolic events have been reported during angiographic procedures with both ionic and nonionic contrast agents. Clotting may occur when blood remains in contact with syringes containing iodinated contrast media. Therefore, meticulous intravascular administration technique is necessary.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease or heart failure. Iodinated contrast media may result in an increased circulatory osmotic load and subsequent acute or delayed hemodynamic changes, especially following the use of large doses or repeated doses. Observe patients with cardiovascular disease for several hours after procedure for the development of delayed hemodynamic changes. Preparatory dehydration may contribute to acute renal failure in patients with heart failure or advanced vascular disease; avoid fluid restriction and maintain normal hydration in these patients.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; these patients may have altered renal blood flow, increasing risk of nephrotoxicity. Preparatory dehydration may contribute to acute renal failure in patients with diabetes; avoid fluid restriction and maintain normal hydration in these patients.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, especially those with concomitant renal impairment or when using both oral and IV contrast agents in close proximity.</p><p>• Homocystinuria: Avoid angiography in patients with homocystinuria; may be at risk for thrombosis and embolism.</p><p>• Hyperthyroidism: Use with caution in patients with thyroid disease; thyroid storm has been reported in patients with history of hyperthyroidism or with an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule.</p><p>• Hypothyroidism: Thyroid function tests indicative of hypothyroidism or transient thyroid suppression have been reported (uncommon) in adult and pediatric patients (including infants); some patients were treated for hypothyroidism.</p><p>• Multiple myeloma: Use with caution in patients with multiple myeloma; use of intravascular contrast agents may lead to renal impairment, especially with concurrent dehydration.</p><p>• Pheochromocytoma: Use with extreme caution in patients with pheochromocytoma (known or suspected). Minimize the amount of contrast agent used (for intravascular administration) and monitor blood pressure closely throughout procedure. Therapy for treatment of hypertensive crisis should be readily available.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. May be associated with deterioration of renal function and/or increases in serum creatinine, particularly in elderly patients and patients with diabetes, advanced vascular disease, and those who are dehydrated. Use lowest dose possible in patients with renal impairment.</p><p>• Sickle cell disease: Use with caution in patients with sickle cell disease; may promote sickling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: For IV or intra-arterial use only. <b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b> <b>Not for intrathecal use</b>. <b>Inadvertent intrathecal administration may cause death, convulsions, cerebral hemorrhage, coma, paralysis, arachnoiditis, acute renal failure, cardiac arrest, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and brain edema. </b>In contrast-enhanced computerized tomography, contrast may obscure some lesions previously seen on unenhanced CT scans.</p><p>• Trained personnel: Clinicians using radiopaque contrast agents should be well trained in diagnosis and management of emergencies that may arise from the use of these agents. Resuscitative equipment, oxygen, and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use during and for 30 to 60 minutes after administration (delayed reactions have occurred).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Renal function, blood pressure, hydration; monitor for extravasation during IV administration; monitor for hypersensitivity reactions for ≥30 to 60 minutes.</p><p>Coronary arteriography: ECG (coronary arteriography); vital signs; signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity; renal function</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Iopromide crosses the placenta and was detected in a newborn's gut and urine at birth (Vanhaesebrouck 2005).</p><p>Thyroid dysfunction in the neonate has not been reported (Kochi 2012). However, due to theoretical concerns that exposure to free iodide may adversely affect the fetus, use should be avoided unless absolutely required to obtain diagnostic information that will influence the care of the mother or fetus during pregnancy (ACOG 723 2017; ACR 2018).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used before a CT scan or other test.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
