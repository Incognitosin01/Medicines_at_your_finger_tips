Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>Lazanda may also cause drowsiness, breathing problems, or withdrawal symptoms in a nursing infant. Do not breastfeed while you are using this medicine.</p><p>Do not give this medication to anyone under 18 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Lazanda?</h2><p>Do not use Lazanda to replace any other form of fentanyl, such as Abstral, Actiq, Fentora, Onsolis, Duragesic, or generic brands of fentanyl (injection, skin patch, dissolving film, or "lollipop" device).</p><p>Fentanyl may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. <b>Never share this medicine with another person. MISUSE OF NARCOTIC PAIN MEDICATION CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away Lazanda is against the law.</p><p>The usual starting dose of Lazanda is 1 single spray into 1 nostril. Your doctor may change your dose. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Fentanyl can slow or stop your breathing. Never use Lazanda in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Keep using your around-the-clock narcotic pain medicine but never use Lazanda together with a second form of fentanyl.</p><p>If you switch to Lazanda from another form of fentanyl, you will not use the same dose. You must start with the lowest dose (100 micrograms).</p><p>Do not use more than one dose for each episode of breakthrough cancer pain.</p><p>Call your doctor if you still have pain within 30 minutes after using the nasal spray. <b>Do not use the nasal spray more than 4 times in 24 hours.</b> You must wait at least 2 hours after your last dose of Lazanda before you can treat a <b>new</b> pain episode.</p><p>Do not treat more than 4 pain episodes per day with Lazanda. Call your doctor if you have breakthrough pain more than 4 times in one day.</p><p>Do not stop using this medicine suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using this medicine.</p><p>Keep out of the reach of children. <b>The amount of fentanyl in each bottle of Lazanda can be fatal to a child.</b></p><p>Do not use a bottle of Lazanda that has not been used for 5 days or longer. Once you have primed a spray bottle, throw it away after 14 days, even if there is still medicine left in it.</p><p>Store at room temperature, away from heat and moisture. Keep the bottle tightly closed and stored in the child-resistant container when not in use.</p><p>Keep track of your medicine. Fentanyl is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush the unused medicine down the toilet.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Lazanda is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A fentanyl overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, weak pulse, fainting, and slow breathing (breathing may stop).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Lazanda?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Fentanyl may impair your thinking or reactions.
