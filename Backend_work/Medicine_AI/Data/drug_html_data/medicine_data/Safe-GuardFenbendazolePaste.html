The chemical structure is:</p><p>Each gram of Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste 10% contains 100 mg of fenbendazole and is flavored with artificial apple-cinnamon liquid.</p><h2>ACTIONS</h2><p class="First">The antiparasitic action of Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste 10% is believed to be due to the inhibition of energy metabolism in the parasite.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><h3>Horse</h3><p class="First">Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste 10% is indicated for the control of large strongyles (<span class="Italics">Strongylus edentatus, S. equinus, S. vulgaris</span>), encysted early 3rd stage (hypobiotic), late 3rd stage and 4th stage cyathostome larvae, small strongyles, pinworms (<span class="Italics">Oxyuris equi</span>), ascarids (<span class="Italics">Parascaris equorum</span>), and arteritis caused by 4th stage larvae of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span> in horses.</p><p>Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste 10% is approved for use concomitantly with an approved form of trichlorfon. Trichlorfon is approved for the treatment of stomach bots (<span class="Italics">Gasterophilus</span> spp.) in horses. Refer to the manufacturer's label for directions for use and cautions for trichlorfon.</p><h3>Beef and Dairy Cattle</h3><p class="First">Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste 10% is indicated for the removal and control of: Lungworm (<span class="Italics">Dictyocaulus viviparus</span>); Stomach worms: (<span class="Italics">Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia ostertagi, Trichostrongylus axei</span>); Intestinal worms: (<span class="Italics">Bunostomum phlebotomum, Nematodirus helvetianus, Cooperia punctata</span> &amp; <span class="Italics">C. oncophora, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Oesophagostomum radiatum</span>).</p><p>Treats 8 animals of 500 lbs. each. Net Wt. 3.2 oz. (92g).</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>Horse</h3><p class="First">Side effects associated with Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste 10% could not be established in well-controlled safety studies in horses with single doses as high as 454 mg/lb. (1,000 mg/kg) and 15 consecutive daily doses of 22.7 mg/lb. (50 mg/kg). At higher dose levels, the lethal action of fenbendazole may cause the release of antigens by the dying parasites. This phenomenon may result in either a local or systemic hypersensitive reaction varying in severity from itching or a rash to increased respiration and collapse. A veterinarian should be consulted if this type of reaction is suspected.</p><p>Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste 10% has been evaluated for safety in pregnant mares during all stages of gestation with doses as high as 11.4 mg/lb. (25 mg/kg) and in stallions with doses as high as 11.4 mg/lb. (25 mg/kg). No adverse effects on reproductivity were detected. The recommended dose for control of 4th stage larvae of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span>, 4.6 mg/lb. (10 mg/kg) daily for 5 consecutive days, has not been evaluated for safety in stallions or pregnant mares.</p><p class="First">Regular deworming at intervals of six to eight weeks may be required due to the possibility of reinfection.</p><p class="First">In the case of 4th stage larvae of <span class="Italics">Strongylus vulgaris</span>, treatment and retreatment should be based on the life cycle and the epidemiology. Treatment should be initiated in the spring and repeated in the fall after a six-month interval.</p><p class="First">Optimum reduction of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span> infections is achieved by reducing the infectivity of the pastures. When horses are running on pasture, in temperate North America, maximum pasture infectivity occurs in October - December. If horses are removed from those pastures in January, pasture infectivity will decline to zero by July 1. Egg production of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span> is minimal from January through April, peaking in August and declining to minimal values in December.</p><p class="First">**December 1, February 1, <span class="Bold">April 1</span>, June 1, August 1, <span class="Bold">October 1</span>.</p><p>The two treatments which are in bold type are the recommended periods when the 5-day treatment regimen for the control of the migrating larvae of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span> should be performed.</p><p>**For other areas in the world, retreatment periods for the migrating larvae of <span class="Italics">S. vulgaris</span> may be different; consult with your veterinarian.</p><h2>CAUTION</h2><p class="First">When using Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> (fenbendazole) Paste 10% concomitantly with trichlorfon, refer to the manufacturer's labels for use and cautions for trichlorfon.</p><h2>Warning</h2><h3>Horse</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not use in horses intended for human consumption.</span></p><h2>DOSAGE</h2><h3>Horse</h3><p class="First">Safe-Guard<span class="Sup">®</span> Paste 10% is administered orally at a rate of 2.3 mg/lb.
