</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Procysbi Delayed Release</h2><p class="First">PROCYSBI is indicated for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in adults and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older.</p><h2>Procysbi Delayed Release Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosing Instructions</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Initiate cysteamine treatment immediately after diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis.</li>
<li>Cysteamine-naïve Patients: Start PROCYSBI at a fraction of the maintenance dosage.
<ul class="Circle">
<li><span class="Italics">Patients 1 year to less than 6 years</span>: Gradually increase the dosage, allowing a minimum of 2 weeks between adjustments <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Patients 6 years of age and older</span>: Gradually increase the dosage over 4 to 6 weeks until the maintenance dosage is achieved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patients switching from immediate-release cysteamine: Start the total daily dosage of PROCYSBI at a dosage equal to the previous total daily dosage of immediate-release cysteamine <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</li>
<li>If adverse reactions occur, decrease the PROCYSBI dosage.</li>
<li>After the maintenance dosage of PROCYSBI is achieved: The dosage may need to be further increased to achieve a therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration. The maximum dosage of PROCYSBI is 1.95 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of body surface area per day <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)]</span>.</li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Round dose calculations to the nearest incremental dosage that can be administered using the available strengths of PROCYSBI delayed-release capsules or packets of oral granules. Only use whole capsules or entire contents of the packets.</span></li>
</ul><ul class="Circle">
<li><span class="Italics">Patients 1 year to less than 6 years</span>: Gradually increase the dosage, allowing a minimum of 2 weeks between adjustments <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Patients 6 years of age and older</span>: Gradually increase the dosage over 4 to 6 weeks until the maintenance dosage is achieved.</li>
</ul><h3>Starting and Maintenance Dosing in Cysteamine-Naïve Patients</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Start treatment with a dosage equal to ⅙ to ¼ of the maintenance dosage.</li>
<li>The maintenance dosage after initial dose escalation is 1.3 g/m<span class="Sup">2</span> of body surface area per day divided into two doses given every 12 hours. Table 1 shows the recommended starting and maintenance dosages of PROCYSBI, converted from body-surface area to body weight.
<ul>
<li><span class="Italics">Patients 1 year to less than 6 years</span>: Increase the dosage in 10% increments to the maintenance dosage, while monitoring WBC cystine concentrations. Allow a minimum of 2 weeks between dosage adjustments <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)]</span>. If a patient achieves the therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration at a dosage below the recommended weight-based maintenance dosage, then stop dosage escalation and use the dosage as the patient's maintenance dosage.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Patients 6 years of age and older</span>: Gradually increase the dosage over 4 to 6 weeks until the maintenance dosage is achieved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a patient experiences initial intolerance, temporarily discontinue PROCYSBI and then re-start at a lower dosage and gradually increase dosage.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><span class="Italics">Patients 1 year to less than 6 years</span>: Increase the dosage in 10% increments to the maintenance dosage, while monitoring WBC cystine concentrations. Allow a minimum of 2 weeks between dosage adjustments <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)]</span>. If a patient achieves the therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration at a dosage below the recommended weight-based maintenance dosage, then stop dosage escalation and use the dosage as the patient's maintenance dosage.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Patients 6 years of age and older</span>: Gradually increase the dosage over 4 to 6 weeks until the maintenance dosage is achieved.</li>
</ul><h3>Switching Patients from Immediate-Release Cysteamine Bitartrate</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>When switching patients from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate to PROCYSBI, the starting total daily dose of PROCYSBI is equal to the previous total daily dose of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Divide the total daily dose by two and administer every 12 hours.</li>
<li>For patients who may experience temporary intolerance upon starting PROCYSBI, decrease the dosage and then gradually increase to the maintenance dosage.</li>
<li>Measure the WBC cystine concentration two weeks after initiation of PROCYSBI <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>. Adjust the PROCYSBI dosage as needed to achieve the therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>. The maximum dosage of PROCYSBI is 1.95 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosage Titration to Therapeutic Target WBC Cystine Concentration</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Measure WBC cystine concentration and titrate the PROCYSBI dosage as needed to achieve the therapeutic target WBC cysteine concentration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</li>
<li>If the measured WBC cystine concentration is above the target level for cystine depletion, consider the following before dose adjustment: adherence to medication and dosing interval, the timing between the last dose and the blood draw for the laboratory measurement, and the timing of PROCYSBI administration in relation to food or other administration instructions.</li>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">If a dose adjustment is required, increase the dosage by 10%, rounded to nearest dosage that can be administered using the available strengths of capsules or packets of oral granules. For patients 1 year to less than 6 years of age, allow a minimum of two weeks between dose increments. The maximum dosage of PROCYSBI is 1.95 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day.</span></li>
<li>If adverse reactions occur, decrease the PROCYSBI dosage. Some patients may be unable to achieve their therapeutic target due to poor tolerability of PROCYSBI <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>WBC cystine concentration may be measured using the mixed leukocyte assay or by using assays for specific WBC subsets (e.g., granulocyte method). The methods used for measuring cystine and total protein content may also vary among individual laboratories <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</li>
<li>Normal WBC cystine ranges and therapeutic target levels for cystine depletion depend upon the assay method used by the individual laboratory. WBC cystine values obtained from using different assay methods may not be interchangeable. Refer to the assay-specific therapeutic target for cystine depletion. When using the mixed leukocyte assay, the recommended target WBC cystine concentration is less than 1 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein<span class="Italics">.</span></li>
<li>The recommended frequency of monitoring WBC cystine concentration is as follows:
<ul class="Circle">
<li><span class="Italics">Cysteamine-naïve patients 1 year to less than 6 years</span>: Obtain measurement two weeks after initiation of PROCYSBI treatment and continue monitoring during dosage titration period until the therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration is achieved. Once the therapeutic target is achieved, continue monitoring monthly for 3 months, then quarterly for 1 year, and then twice-yearly, at a minimum.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Cysteamine-naïve patients greater than 6 years</span>: Obtain measurement after reaching the maintenance PROCYSBI dosage, then monthly for 3 months, quarterly for 1 year, and then twice-yearly, at a minimum.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Patients switching from immediate-release cysteamine to PROCYSBI</span>: Obtain measurement two weeks after initiation of PROCYSBI treatment and continue monitoring if further dosage titration is required to achieve therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration. Once the therapeutic target is achieved, continue monitoring quarterly for 6 months, then twice yearly, at a minimum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obtain blood samples for WBC cystine concentration measurement 12 hours after the patient's last PROCYSBI dose, prior to administration of the next dose (i.e., trough concentration). In addition, it is important to accurately record the time of the last dose, the actual dose, and the time the blood sample was taken.</li>
</ul><ul class="Circle">
<li><span class="Italics">Cysteamine-naïve patients 1 year to less than 6 years</span>: Obtain measurement two weeks after initiation of PROCYSBI treatment and continue monitoring during dosage titration period until the therapeutic target WBC cystine concentration is achieved.

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">The use of PROCYSBI is contraindicated in patients with a serious hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, to penicillamine or cysteamine.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Skin and bone lesions that resemble clinical findings for Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome have been reported in patients treated with high doses of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate or other cysteamine salts. These include molluscoid pseudotumors (purplish hemorrhagic lesions), skin striae, bone lesions (including osteopenia, compression fractures, scoliosis and genu valgum), leg pain, and joint hyperextension. One patient on immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate with serious skin lesions subsequently died of acute cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy. Monitor patients for development of skin or bone lesions and interrupt PROCYSBI dosing if patients develop these lesions. PROCYSBI may be restarted at a lower dose under close supervision, then slowly increase to the appropriate therapeutic dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Skin Rash</h3><p class="First">Severe skin rashes such as erythema multiforme bullosa or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. If severe skin rashes develop, permanently discontinue use of PROCYSBI <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Ulcers and Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration and bleeding have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. GI tract symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain, sometimes severe, have been associated with cysteamine. If severe GI tract symptoms develop, consider decreasing the dose of PROCYSBI <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Central Nervous System Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy have been associated with immediate-release cysteamine. Neurological complications have also been described in some patients with cystinosis who have not been treated with cysteamine. Carefully evaluate and monitor patients who develop CNS symptoms. Interrupt medication or adjust the dose as necessary for patients with severe symptoms or with symptoms that persist or progress. Inform patients that PROCYSBI may impair their ability to perform tasks such as driving or operating machinery.</p><h3>Leukopenia and/or Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase Levels</h3><p class="First">Cysteamine has been associated with reversible leukopenia and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Monitor white blood cell counts and alkaline phosphatase levels. If tests values remain elevated, consider decreasing the dose or discontinuing the drug until values revert to normal.</p><h3>Benign Intracranial Hypertension</h3><p class="First">Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri; PTC) and/or papilledema have been reported in patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate treatment. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of PTC, including headache, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, diplopia, blurry vision, loss of vision, pain behind the eye or pain with eye movement. If signs/symptoms persist, interrupt dosing or decrease the dose and refer the patient to an ophthalmologist. If the diagnosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue use of PROCYSBI.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ehlers-Danlos-like Syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Skin Rash <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>

<li>Benign Intracranial Hypertension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to cysteamine in 345 patients with nephropathic cystinosis (246 patients receiving immediate-release cysteamine as cysteamine hydrochloride or phosphocysteamine, and 80 patients receiving PROCYSBI) in open-label clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials Experience with PROCYSBI in Patients Switched from Immediate-Release Cysteamine Bitartrate</span></p><p>Sixty-two patients with nephropathic cystinosis (38 males and 24 females) received PROCYSBI in two clinical trials at doses ranging from 0.29 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day to 2.19 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span> All patients were switched from immediate-release cysteamine to PROCYSBI. Forty-three patients, ages 6 to 26 years old, received PROCYSBI in an 8-week, open-label, randomized, cross-over trial comparing PROCYSBI to immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Forty of 43 patients continued PROCYSBI treatment in an open-label extension trial (36 patients were treated with PROCYSBI for longer than 2 years, and 20 patients were treated for longer than 5 years). An additional 19 patients (6 renal transplanted patients and 13 patients aged 2 to 6 years) were enrolled directly into this trial (12 patients were treated with PROCYSBI for longer than 2 years, and 9 patients were treated for longer than 5 years).</p><p>In the open-label, randomized, cross-over trial, a higher incidence of adverse reactions was reported in patients during the PROCYSBI treatment period compared with the immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate treatment period (see Table 2). Other significant adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.</p><p>In the open-label extension trial (N=59), the most commonly reported adverse reactions (&gt;15%) were vomitin g, headache, diarrhea, nausea, conjunctivitis, influenza, gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, abdominal pain, dehydration, ear infection, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, arthralgia, cough, and pain in extremity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials Experience with PROCYSBI in Cysteamine-Naïve Patients</span></p><p>Seventeen cysteamine-naïve patients (fifteen patients between the ages of 1 and 5 years, one 9-year old and one 22-year old) received PROCYSBI in an open-label clinical trial <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>. Serious adverse reactions occurring in at least 2 patients (&gt;10%) were: gastroenteritis/viral gastroenteritis (n=6), vomiting (n=4), and electrolyte imbalance (n=2). Three patients with serious adverse reactions of gastroenteritis also had dehydration. Common adverse reactions reported at a frequency of &gt;10% (occurring in at least 2 patients) are shown in Table 3.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials Experience with Immediate-Release Cysteamine</span></p><p>The most frequent adverse reactions involved the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems and were especially prominent at the initiation of cysteamine therapy. Most patients were able to resume therapy at lower doses. The most common reactions (&gt;5%) were vomiting, anorexia, fever, diarrhea, lethargy, and rash. Other adverse reactions included nausea, bad breath, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and urticaria.</p><p>Withdrawals due to intolerance, vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and fever occurred more frequently in those patients receiving 1.95 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day as compared with 1.3 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs that Increase Gastric pH</h3><p class="First">Drugs that increase the gastric pH (e.g., medications containing bicarbonate or carbonate) may alter the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine due to the premature release of cysteamine from PROCYSBI and increase WBC cystine concentration. Concomitant administration of 20 mg omeprazole did not affect the pharmacokinetics of cysteamine when PROCYSBI was administered with 240 mL of orange juice or with 240 mL of water <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Monitor WBC cystine concentration when drugs that increase the gastric pH are concomitantly used <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><h3>Use with Alcohol</h3><p class="First">Consumption of alcohol with PROCYSBI may increase the rate of cysteamine release and/or adversely alter the pharmacokinetic properties, as well as the effectiveness and safety of PROCYSBI. Therefore, do not consume alcoholic beverages during treatment with PROCYSBI <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><h3>Other Medications Used for the Management of Fanconi Syndrome</h3><p class="First">PROCYSBI can be administered with other electrolyte and mineral replacements necessary for management of Fanconi syndrome, as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormone.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on PROCYSBI use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks for birth defects or miscarriage <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Cysteamine (administered as cysteamine bitartrate) was teratogenic and fetotoxic in rats at doses less than the recommended human maintenance dose.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Embryo-fetal development studies were conducted in rats using oral administration of cysteamine bitartrate, with a dose range of 37.5 to 150 mg/kg per day of cysteamine equivalent (about 0.2 to 0.7 times the recommended human maintenance dose based on body surface area). Cysteamine bitartrate was fetotoxic and produced adverse developmental effects. Observed teratogenic findings were cleft palate, kyphosis, heart ventricular septal defects, microcephaly and exencephaly.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information on the presence of cysteamine in human milk, the effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Cysteamine is present in the milk of lactating rats <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span> Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from cysteamine, breastfeeding is not recommended.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>A decrease in survival occurred in neonatal rats nursed by mothers receiving cysteamine <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of PROCYSBI have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis. Use of PROCYSBI is supported by evidence from patients switched to PROCYSBI from immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate in two trials: an open-label, randomized, cross-over trial in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older (n=43) and an open-label extension trial in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older (n=59). Another open-label trial was conducted in cysteamine naïve pediatric patients 1 year to less than 6 years of age (n=15) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Trials (14.2)]</span>. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to adults. In patients less than 6 years of age, vomiting occurred in 12/15 cysteamine treatment naïve patients compared to 11/13 patients switched from immediate-release cysteamine to PROCYSBI.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of PROCYSBI have not been established in patients less than 1 year of age.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No studies with PROCYSBI have been conducted in geriatric patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">One case of overdosing with PROCYSBI has been reported. A 16-year old male patient suffered nausea and vomiting after he mistakenly took a second dose of PROCYSBI 30 minutes after his usual dose.</p><p>Two cases of overdosing with immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate have been reported in two patients. In the first case, the patient immediately vomited after ingesting an unknown dose and did not develop any symptoms. The second case involved an accidental ingestion of a 200 to 250 mg/kg dose by a healthy 13-month-old child. Vomiting and dehydration were experienced. The child was hospitalized and fluids were administered. The patient fully recovered from the overdosing.</p><p>Should overdosing occur, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be supported appropriately. No specific antidote is known. Hemodialysis may be considered since cysteamine is poorly bound to plasma proteins.</p><h2>Procysbi Delayed Release Description</h2><p class="First">PROCYSBI, for oral administration, is a cystine-depleting agent that lowers the cystine content of cells in patients with nephropathic cystinosis, an inherited defect of lysosomal transport.</p><p>PROCYSBI contains the bitartrate salt of cysteamine.

Untreated patients with nephropathic cystinosis have elevations of WBC cystine concentration above 2 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein.</p><p>After the administration of a single dose of PROCYSBI, peak concentrations of cysteamine were observed at 3 hours post-dose. The nadir of WBC cystine closely followed the peak concentrations at 3.5 hours post-dose, and returned to baseline WBC concentrations at 12 hours-post dose. The cystine concentration in WBC lysate was measured with LC/MS/MS and total protein content in human WBC lysate was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. A correction factor was applied to the total protein content for the difference in results from the Lowry method. The cystine concentration in nmol ½ cystine/mg protein was calculated by multiplying nmol cystine/mg protein by 2 <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of cysteamine with administration of PROCYSBI were evaluated in 43 patients age ranged from 6 to 26 years (mean age 12 years) with cystinosis and with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of greater than 30 mL/minutes/1.73 m2. Table 4 shows the mean pharmacokinetic parameters for PROCYSBI and immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate at steady state. The mean (± SD) dose for PROCYSBI was 656 ± 144 mg/m2 (given every 12 hours) and for immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate was 404 ± 88 mg/m2 (given every 6 hours).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of cysteamine with administration of PROCYSBI are consistent with a delayed-release formulation; the mean T<span class="Sub">max</span> for cysteamine was 188 minutes with PROCYSBI compared with 73 minutes for immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate.</p><p>The mean plasma cysteamine peak and AUC were similar when a single PROCYSBI dose of 600 mg was administered with 240 mL orange juice or with 240 mL water. The systemic exposure to cysteamine was similar when PROCYSBI was administered with orange juice as a whole capsule and sprinkled in applesauce in the fasted state.

Cysteamine was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance at an oral dose of 75 mg/kg per day (450 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day, 0.4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area). At an oral dose of 375 mg/kg per day (2250 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day, 1.7 times the recommended human maintenance dose based on body surface area), it reduced the fertility of the adult rats and the survival of their offspring.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Clinical Trials with Immediate-Release Cysteamine</h3><p class="First">Efficacy of immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate was demonstrated in open-label clinical trials of cysteamine hydrochloride and phosphocysteamine.</p><p>An open-label clinical trial of cysteamine hydrochloride was conducted in 94 pediatric patients (mainly from the United States) with nephropathic cystinosis. Patients were treated with increasing doses of cysteamine hydrochloride (mean dose 54 mg/kg per day) to attain WBC cystine concentrations of less than 2 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose. The clinical outcomes were compared with a historical control group of 17 pediatric patients who had been in the placebo group of a randomized placebo-controlled trial of ascorbic acid. Cysteamine-treated patients had been diagnosed at a mean age of 22 months and had a mean age of 46 months old at study entry; placebo patients had been diagnosed at about 29 months and had a mean age of about 52 months old at trial entry. The principal measures of effectiveness were serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance and growth (height).</p><p>The average median WBC cystine concentration during treatment was 1.7 ± 0.2 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein. There were 70 cysteamine-treated patients with a baseline serum creatinine of less than 2 mg/dL who were followed for at least 1 year, and 17 placebo patients. Twelve of the 94 cysteamine-treated patients required early dialysis or renal transplant. Median follow-up of cysteamine patients was over 32 months, and 20% were followed more than 5 years. Median follow-up of the placebo group was 20 months; only 1 patient was followed more than 24 months. Glomerular function among cysteamine-treated patients was maintained over time. Placebo-treated patients experienced a gradual rise in serum creatinine. Renal tubular function was not affected by treatment.</p><p>Calculated creatinine clearances were evaluated for two groups of pediatric patients, one with poor WBC cystine depletion (defined as median WBC cystine concentrations greater than 3 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein or WBC cystine concentrations not measured at least 2 times per year) and one with good WBC cystine depletion. The final mean creatinine clearance of the good depletion group was 20.8 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> greater than the mean for the poor-depletion group.</p><p>Height-for-age measurements of treated patients were compared with height-for-age measurements of 143 patients initially screened for inclusion in the trial. Patients on treatment maintained growth (i.e., did not show increasing growth failure compared with normal scales) although growth velocity did not increase enough to allow patients to catch up to age norms for height.</p><p>In another open-label clinical trial, 46 patients who had completed the clinical trial of cysteamine hydrochloride (averaging 6.5 years of treatment) and 93 treatment naïve patients were treated with either cysteamine hydrochloride or phosphocysteamine (patient's choice). Patients had cystinosis diagnosed by elevated WBC cystine (mean 3.63 nmol ½ cystine/mg). Newly enrolled patients and the 46 continuing patients were required to have serum creatinine less than 3 mg/dL and 4 mg/dL, respectively. Patients were randomized to doses of 1.3 or 1.95 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day and stratified according to whether the serum creatinine was above 1.2 mg/dL or not. Doses could be raised if WBC cystine concentrations were approximately 2 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein and lowered due to intolerance. The mean age of the newly enrolled patients was about 49 months for the cysteamine group and about 34 months for the phosphocysteamine group. The mean age of the patients in the long-term follow-up group was about 9 years.</p><p>Mean doses were 1.27 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day and 1.87 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day in the two groups and WBC cystine concentrations averaged 1.72 ± 1.65 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein and 1.86 ± 0.92 nmol ½ cystine/mg protein in the 1.3 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day and 1.95 grams/m<span class="Sup">2</span> per day in the two groups, respectively. In new patients, serum creatinine was essentially unchanged over the period of follow-up (about half of the patients were followed for 24 months) and phosphocysteamine and cysteamine hydrochloride had similar effects. The long-term follow-up group also had essentially no change in renal function (almost 80% were followed at least 2 years). In four studies of patients with untreated cystinosis, renal death (need for transplant or dialysis) occurred at median age of less than 10 years. Both new patients and patients in the long-term follow-up group maintained height (although they did not catch up from baseline). There was no apparent difference in height maintenance between the two doses.</p><h3>Clinical Trials with PROCYSBI</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Multi-Center, Open-Label, Randomized Clinical Trial in Patients Receiving Immediate-Release Cysteamine Bitartrate</span></p><p>A clinical trial comparing immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate and PROCYSBI was conducted in 43 (40 pediatric and 3 adult) patients with nephropathic cystinosis (Study RP103-03; NCT01000961).
