Isavuconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. An accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane weakens the membrane structure and function.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>ss</sub>: IV: ~450 L</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Metabolism: Isavuconazonium sulfate (prodrug) is rapidly hydrolyzed in the blood by esterases to active isavuconazole and an inactive cleavage product.

Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Reconstitute 1 vial of isavuconazonium with 5 mL SWFI. Shake gently to dissolve. The reconstituted solution may be stored below 25°C for a maximum of 1 hour prior to preparation of the admixed solution. Remove 5 mL of the reconstituted solution from the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL (approximately isavuconazonium sulfate 1.5 mg/mL) of NS or D5W. The diluted solution may show visible translucent to white particulates of isavuconazole (will be removed by in-line filtration). Use gentle mixing or roll bag to minimize the formation of particulates. Avoid unnecessary vibration or vigorous shaking of the solution. Do not use a pneumatic transport system. Apply in-line filter with a microporous membrane pore size of 0.2 to 1.2 micron and in-line filter reminder sticker to the infusion bag. The IV administration should be completed within 6 hours at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). If this is not possible, immediately refrigerate (2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]) the admixed solution and complete the infusion within 24 hours.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p><b>IV:</b> Infuse over a minimum of 1 hour; must be administered via an infusion set with an in-line filter (pore size 0.2 to 1.2 micron). Flush line with NS or D5W before and after infusion. Do not administer as an IV bolus injection.</p><p><b>Oral:</b> Administer with or without food. The manufacturer recommends to swallow capsules whole; do not chew, crush, dissolve, or open. Administration of isavuconazole by opening capsules and mixing contents with saline or tube feed formulations for administration via enteral feeding tubes has resulted in comparable isavuconazole concentrations to IV administration and intact capsule formulations. If capsules are opened, consider assessing serum concentrations to ensure absorption (Adamsick 2019; McCreary 2020).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Capsules: Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) in the original packaging to protect from moisture; excursions are permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).</p><p>IV: Store intact vials at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Following reconstitution of the vial with SWFI, use the solution immediately, or stored below 25°C for a maximum of 1 hour prior to preparation of the admixed solution in NS or D5W. The admixed infusion solution should be kept for not more than 6 hours at (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]) or 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) prior to use.
