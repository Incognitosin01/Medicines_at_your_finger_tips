Hair may be shampooed at any time after treatment. Use in conjunction with an overall lice management program: wash (with hot water) or dry-clean all recently worn clothing, hats, used bedding, and towels; wash personal care items such as combs, brushes, and hair clips in hot water; and use a fine-tooth comb or special nit comb to remove dead lice and nits.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store upright at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Do not refrigerate or freeze. Discard unused product; do not flush contents down sink or toilet.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>CYP1A2 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors): Abametapir may increase the serum concentration of CYP1A2 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>CYP2B6 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors): Abametapir may increase the serum concentration of CYP2B6 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors): Abametapir may increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). <i> Avoid combination</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Dermatologic: Burning sensation of skin (3%), contact dermatitis (2%), erythema of skin (4%), hair discoloration (1%), localized erythema (scalp: ≤3%), skin rash (3%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Vomiting (2%)</p><p>Local: Localized edema (scalp: ≤3%), local pruritus (scalp: 1%)</p><p>Ophthalmic: Eye irritation (1% to 2%)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Pediatric patients: Use under direct adult supervision. Keep out of reach of children. Use is not recommended for infants &lt;6 months of age due to the potential for increased systemic absorption.</p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity ("gasping syndrome") in neonates; the "gasping syndrome" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP 1997; CDC 1982); some data suggest that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates.
