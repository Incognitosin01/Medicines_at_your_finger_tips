It is indigenous to the hills and mountains of California, Oregon, and northern Mexico and is often cultivated as an ornamental shrub. The plant grows to 2.5 m in height at elevations exceeding 1,219 m. The hairy, lance-shaped leaves are glutinous, and its flowers are white to lavender in color. Also known as Eriodictyon glutinosum Benth. and Wigandia californicum Hook. &amp; Arn.Chevalier 2001, Khan 2009, USDA 2016</p><h2>History</h2><p>The name yerba santa ("holy weed") was given by the Spanish priests who learned of the medicinal value of the shrub from the American Indians.Chevalier 2001 The plant has a long tradition of use in the United States. The thick sticky leaves, used either fresh or dried, were boiled to make a tea or taken as treatment for coughs, colds, asthma, and tuberculosis. The leaves have been powdered and used as a stimulating expectorant.Lewis 1977 A liniment was applied topically to reduce fever. A poultice of fresh leaves was used to treat bruises, and young leaves were applied to relieve rheumatism.Balls 1962, Sweet 1976 The plant is contained in a number of herbal preparations. Yerba santa has been used as a pharmaceutical flavoring, particularly to mask the flavor of bitter drugs.Khan 2009 The fluid extract is used in foods and beverages.Duke 2003</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Yerba santa contains a volatile oil, up to 6% eriodictyonine, about 0.5% eriodictyol (the aglycone of eriodictin), and several related alcoholic compounds, ericolin, and a resin.Duke 1992, Khan 2009</p><p>Spectroscopic analysis and alkaline hydrolysis resulted in the isolation of 12 flavonoids. Eight active flavanones were identified as 3′-methyl-4′-isobutyryleriodictoyol, eriodictyol, homoeriodictyol, 5,4′-dihydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone, pinocembrin, sakuranetin, 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-6,3′-dimethoxyflavanone, and naringenin 4′-methyl ether.Liu 1992</p><p>Four active flavones were also isolated: cirsimaritin, chrysoeriol, hispidulin, and chrysin.Liu 1992</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Review of the scientific literature reveals no evidence evaluating the effectiveness of yerba santa in humans or animals. Tertiary resources report that eriodictyol exerts an expectorant action.Khan 2009 The plant also has been investigated for treating xerostomia, as a substitute for tobacco use, to reduce skin or mucosal irritation, and as a moisturizer.Coy-Herbert 2002, Lewis 1977, Parnell 1993</p><p>Cirsimaritin and chrysoeriol may warrant further investigation in vivo as potential chemopreventive agents.Liu 1992</p><p>Anti-inflammatory effects have been suggested for extracts based on screening studies,Mazzio 2016, Walker 2016 and suggest that the chemical constituent eriodictyol can inhibit mast cell degranulation.Yoo 2012</p><h3>Animal/Clinical data</h3><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of yerba santa for any condition.</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There is no recent clinical evidence to support dose of recommendations for yerba santa. Classical use of the leaf as an expectorant was at 1 g doses.Duke 2003</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactations is lacking. Avoid use.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>There are no reports of significant toxicity associated with the topical or systemic use of yerba santa.</p><p>Allergic contact dermatitis has been reported for a related species Eriodictyon parryi (poodle-dog bush).Czaplicki 2013</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>There are no reports of significant toxicity associated with the topical or systemic use of yerba santa.</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Eriodictyon glutinosum</i> Benth.</li><li><i>Wigandia californicum</i> Hook. &amp; Arn.</li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
