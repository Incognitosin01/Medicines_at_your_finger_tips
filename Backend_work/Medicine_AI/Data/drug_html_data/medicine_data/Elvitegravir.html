</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Integrase Inhibitor</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for elvitegravir</h2><p>Elvitegravir is used in combination with ritonavir and another HIV medicine (eg, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir, tipranavir) to treat infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Elvitegravir is used in patients who are already taking or have received HIV medicines in the past.</p><p>Elvitegravir will not cure or prevent HIV infection or AIDS, however, it helps keep HIV from reproducing and appears to slow down the destruction of the immune system. This may help delay the development of problems that usually result from AIDS or HIV disease. Elvitegravir will not keep you from spreading HIV to other people. People who receive elvitegravir may continue to have some of the problems usually related to AIDS or HIV disease.</p><p>Elvitegravir is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using elvitegravir</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For elvitegravir, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to elvitegravir or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of elvitegravir in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of elvitegravir in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution for patients receiving elvitegravir.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking elvitegravir, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using elvitegravir with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of elvitegravir</h2><p><i>Take elvitegravir exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Also, do not change the dose or stop taking elvitegravir without checking first with your doctor. When your supply of elvitegravir is running low, contact your doctor or pharmacist ahead of time. Do not allow yourself to run out of elvitegravir.</p><p>Elvitegravir comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p><i>Keep taking elvitegravir for the full time of treatment</i>, even if you begin to feel better. It is also important that you continue taking all other medicines for HIV infection your doctor has instructed you to take. Elvitegravir will not work if it is taken alone. It must be taken with other HIV medicines.</p><p>Elvitegravir works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. <i>To help keep blood levels constant, do not miss any doses</i>. Also, it is best to take the doses at evenly spaced times during the day. For example, if you are taking one dose per day, try to take it at the same time each day. If you need help planning the best times to take your medicine, check with your doctor.</p><p>Take elvitegravir with food.</p><p>If you are also using didanosine, take it at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after taking elvitegravir. If you are also using an antacid, take it at least 2 hours before or after elvitegravir.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of elvitegravir will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of elvitegravir. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
