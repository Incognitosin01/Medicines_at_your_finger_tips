If hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria develop, discontinue treatment until parameters of calcium metabolism have normalized. The incidence of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria following calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension treatment of more than 8 weeks has not been evaluated. <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span></p><h3>Effects on Endocrine System</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression</span></p><p>Calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.</p><p>Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.</p><p>The following trials evaluated the effects of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension on HPA axis suppression:</p><p><span class="Bold">Cushing’s Syndrome and Hyperglycemia</span></p><p>Cushing’s syndrome and hyperglycemia may occur due to the systemic effects of the topical corticosteroid. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to excessively large doses, especially of high-potency topical corticosteroids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Additional Considerations for Endocrine Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios. <span class="Italics">[See Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span></p><p>Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure.</p><h3>Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Corticosteroids</h3><p class="First">Allergic contact dermatitis to a topical corticosteroid is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.</p><h3>Allergic Contact Dermatitis with Topical Calcipotriene</h3><p class="First">Allergic contact dermatitis has been observed with use of topical calcipotriene. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.</p><h3>Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Use of topical corticosteroids, including Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported with the postmarketing use of topical corticosteroid products <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> Avoid contact of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension with eyes. Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension may cause eye irritation. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials Conducted in Subjects 18 years and older with Psoriasis of the Scalp</span></p><p>The rates of adverse reactions described below were from randomized, multicenter, vehicle- and/or active controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with psoriasis of the scalp <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.

Although there are no available data on use of the calcipotriene component in pregnant women, systemic exposure to calcipotriene after topical administration of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension is likely to be low <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Observational studies suggest an increased risk of having low birth weight infants with the maternal use of potent or super potent topical corticosteroids <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Advise pregnant women that Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension may increase the potential risk of having a low birth weight infant and to use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Oral administration of calcipotriene to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis had no apparent effects on embryo-fetal development. Subcutaneous administration of betamethasone dipropionate to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and fetal malformations (cleft palate and crooked or short tail) <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Available observational studies in pregnant women did not identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, preterm delivery, or fetal mortality with the use of topical corticosteroids of any potency. However, when the dispensed amount of potent or super potent topical corticosteroids exceeded 300 grams during the entire pregnancy, maternal use was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight in infants.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Embryo-fetal development studies with calcipotriene were performed by the oral route in rats and rabbits. Pregnant rats received dosages of 0, 6, 18, or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) on days 6-15 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). There were no apparent effects on maternal survival, behavior, or body weight gain, no effects on litter parameters, and no effects on the incidence of major malformations in fetuses. Fetuses from dams dosed at 54 mcg/kg/day exhibited a significantly increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including enlarged fontanelles and extra ribs.</p><p>Pregnant rabbits were dosed daily with calcipotriene at exposures of 0, 4, 12, or 36 mcg/kg/day (0, 48, 144, and 432 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) on days 6-18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Mean maternal body weight gain was reduced in animals dosed at 12 or 36 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of fetal deaths was increased in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day; reduced fetal weight was also observed in this group. The incidence of major malformations among fetuses was not affected. An increase in the incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities, including incomplete ossification of sternebrae, pubic bones, and forelimb phalanges, was observed in the group dosed at 36 mcg/kg/day.</p><p>Embryo-fetal development studies with betamethasone dipropionate were performed via subcutaneous injection in mice and rabbits. Pregnant mice were administered doses of 0, 156, 625, or 2500 mcg/kg/day (0, 468, 1875, and 7500 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) on days 7 through 13 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, malformations (increased incidence of the cleft palate and crooked or short tail), and minor skeletal abnormalities (delayed ossification of vertebra and sternebrae). Fetal toxicity was observed at the lowest exposure that was evaluated (156 mcg/kg/day).</p><p>Pregnant rabbits were injected subcutaneously at dosages of 0, 0.625, 2.5, and 10 mcg/kg/day (0, 7.5, 30, and 120 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) on days 6 through 18 of gestation (the period of organogenesis). Betamethasone dipropionate induced fetal toxicity, including fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, external malformations (including malformed ears, cleft palate, umbilical hernia, kinked tail, club foot, and club hand), and skeletal malformations (including absence of phalanges of the first digit and cranial dysplasia) at dosages of 2.5 mcg/kg/day and above.</p><p>Calcipotriene was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 6, 18 or 54 mcg/kg/day (0, 36, 108, and 324 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) from gestation day 15 through day 20 postpartum. No remarkable effects were observed on any parameter, including survival, behavior, body weight, litter parameters, or the ability to nurse or rear pups.</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate was evaluated for effects on peri- and post-natal development when orally administered to pregnant rats at dosages of 0, 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day (0, 600, 1800, and 6000 mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively) from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Mean maternal body weight was significantly reduced on gestation day 20 in animals dosed at 300 and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean duration of gestation was slightly, but statistically significantly, increased at 100, 300, and 1000 mcg/kg/day. The mean percentage of pups that survived to day 4 was reduced in relation to dosage. On lactation day 5, the percentage of pups with a reflex to right themselves when placed on their back was significantly reduced at 1000 mcg/kg/day. No effects on the ability of pups to learn were observed, and the ability of the offspring of treated rats to reproduce was not affected.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of topically administered calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Concentrations of calcipotriene in plasma are low after topical administration, and therefore, concentrations in human milk are likely to be low <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. It is not known whether topical administration of large amounts of betamethasone dipropionate could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp have been established in pediatric patients age 12 to 17 years. The use of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and from uncontrolled trials in pediatric subjects that enrolled 109 adolescents with moderate psoriasis of the scalp. After 4 weeks of once daily treatment with calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension, HPA axis suppression was observed in 3% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and 16% of adolescents with psoriasis of the scalp and body. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and</span><span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p>Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients are, therefore, also at greater risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency with the use of topical corticosteroids including calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate topical suspension <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p>Rare systemic toxicities such as Cushing’s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients, especially those with prolonged exposure to large doses of high potency topical corticosteroids. Local adverse reactions including striae have also been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Calcipotriene and Betamethasone Dipropionate Topical Suspension in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established.</p><p><span class="Italics">Additional pediatric use information is approved for LEO Pharma A/S’s Taclonex® (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) Topical Suspension.
