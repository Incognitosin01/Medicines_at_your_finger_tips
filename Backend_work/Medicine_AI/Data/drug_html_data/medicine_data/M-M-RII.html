Measles, mumps, and rubella can cause minor symptoms such as fever, headache, sore throat, cough, swollen glands, runny nose, eye irritation, skin rash, muscle aches, and joint pain.</p><p>More serious symptoms of measles or mumps include pneumonia, hearing loss, painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely permanent brain damage or death.</p><p>Becoming infected with rubella virus (also called German Measles) during pregnancy can result in a miscarriage or serious birth defects.</p><p>The  M-M-R II is used to help prevent these diseases by causing your body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>MMR vaccine is for use in children between the ages of 12 months and 6 years old, and in adults who have never received the vaccine or had the diseases.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the MMR vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if:</p><ul>

You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or clinic setting.</p><p>In children, the first shot is usually given when the child is 12 to 15 month old. The booster shots are then given between 4 and 6 years of age, or before the child starts elementary school.</p><p>The CDC recommends an MMR vaccine for infants 6 to 11 months old who will be traveling outside the United States.</p><p>Adults who are not already immune to measles, mumps, or rubella should receive MMR vaccine in a series of 2 shots separated by at least 28 days (4 weeks).</p><p>Where there has been a measles outbreak, local health departments may recommend 1 or 2 doses of MMR vaccine for children as young as 6 months old, and for older children and adults who are not already immune to measles, mumps, and rubella.</p><p>If you have been exposed to measles, mumps, or rubella, you should receive an MMR vaccine within 72 hours after exposure.</p><p><b>A child who has received this vaccine before 12 months of age</b> should still receive an MMR vaccine at age 12 to 15 months, followed by a booster shot at the recommended ages of 4 to 6 years for long-lasting protection.</p><p>Your booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by your local health department.</p><p>This vaccine can cause false results on a skin test for tuberculosis for up to 6 weeks. Tell any doctor who treats you that you have received an MMR vaccine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor if you will miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><p>Be sure to receive all recommended doses of this vaccine or you may not be fully protected against disease.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after receiving this vaccine?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">This vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction</b> (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) <b>or a severe skin reaction</b> (fever, sore throat, burning eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash with blistering and peeling).</p><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side effects.</p><p>Becoming infected with measles, mumps, or rubella is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine.
