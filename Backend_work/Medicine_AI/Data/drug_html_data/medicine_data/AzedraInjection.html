</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Azedra Injection</h2><p class="First">AZEDRA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with iobenguane scan positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who require systemic anticancer therapy.</p><h2>Azedra Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Safety Information</h3><p class="First">AZEDRA is a radiopharmaceutical. Handle with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Use waterproof gloves and effective radiation shielding when handling AZEDRA. Radiopharmaceuticals, including AZEDRA, should be used by or under the control of physicians who are qualified by specific training and experience in the safe use and handling of radiopharmaceuticals, and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate governmental agency authorized to license the use of radiopharmaceuticals.</p><p>Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating AZEDRA <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First">Administer thyroid blockade and other pre- and concomitant medications as recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dosimetric Dose</span></p><p>The recommended AZEDRA dosimetric dose administered as an intravenous injection is:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Patients weighing greater than 50 kg: 185 to 222 MBq (5 or 6 mCi)</li>
<li>Patients weighing 50 kg or less: 3.7 MBq/kg (0.1 mCi/kg)</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Dosimetry and Biodistribution Assessment</span></p><p>Following the AZEDRA dosimetric dose:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Acquire anterior/posterior whole body gamma camera images within 1 hour of the AZEDRA dosimetric dose and prior to patient voiding (Day 0; Scan 1).</li>
<li>Acquire additional images on Day 1 or 2 following patient voiding (Scan 2).</li>
<li>Acquire additional images between Days 2-5 following patient voiding (Scan 3).</li>
</ul><p>For each individual patient, calculate the radiation dose estimates to normal organs and tissues per unit activity [D (organ)] of administered dose using data extracted from these 3 images. Calculate in accordance with the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) schema or related methodology. Whenever possible, use patient-specific organ masses (e.g., estimated from imaging).</p><p><span class="Bold">Therapeutic Dosage</span></p><p>The recommended AZEDRA therapeutic dose is based on body weight and reduced, if necessary, based on the dosimetry data. Administer a total of 2 therapeutic doses intravenously a minimum of 90 days apart.</p><p><span class="Italics">Weight Based Dose per Therapeutic Cycle</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Patients weighing greater than 62.5 kg: 18,500 MBq (500 mCi)</li>
<li>Patients weighing 62.5 kg or less: 296 MBq/kg (8 mCi/kg)</li>
</ul><p><span class="Italics">Determine if Dose Reduction Needed Based on Critical Organ Limits</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Calculate the estimated critical organ absorbed-dose by multiplying the dosimetry-derived radiation absorbed-dose per unit activity [D (organ)] by weight based therapeutic total activity (Aw).</li>
<li>If resulting estimated critical organ absorbed-dose is less than threshold absorbed-dose (T) shown in Table 1, no dose adjustment is necessary.</li>
<li>If resulting estimated critical organ absorbed-dose exceeds threshold absorbed-dose (T) shown in Table 1, calculate the reduced therapeutic total activity (i.e., the cumulative activity that would be administered in 2 therapeutic cycles) using the following equation:<br/>
           Reduced Therapeutic Total Activity= Aw ×[T ÷ {Aw × D (organ)}]</li>
<li>Example: A 75 kg patient qualifies for a therapeutic total activity of 1000 mCi (Aw). For the kidneys, the dosimetry yields an estimated critical organ absorbed dose per unit activity of 0.027 Gy/mCi [D (kidney)]. Thus, the estimated critical organ absorbed-dose to the kidney is 27 Gy [Aw x D (organ)], which exceeds the threshold absorbed-dose for the kidneys (T) of 18 Gy (Table 1). Using the equation above the reduced therapeutic total activity to be administered to this patient is 666.7 mCi.<br/>
           1000 mCi × [18 Gy ÷ {1000 mCi × 0.027 Gy/mCi}]</li>
</ul><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">*</span>Threshold of ~0.5 Gy for both heart and carotid artery, derived from experience with external-beam radiotherapy and associated with fractionated exposure, has also been proposed to support an ~1% mortality rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deaths in &gt;10-15 years; however, uncertainty is associated with the value ~ 0.5 Gy cited for vascular disease (ICRP publication 118, p.300, Table 4,5).

Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. These risks of radiation associated with the use of AZEDRA are greater in pediatric patients than in adults <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p>Minimize radiation exposure to patients, medical personnel, and household contacts during and after treatment with AZEDRA consistent with institutional good radiation safety practices and patient management procedures <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><h3>Myelosuppression</h3><p class="First">Severe and prolonged myelosuppression occurred during treatment with AZEDRA <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Among the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA, 33% experienced Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 16% experienced Grade 4 neutropenia, and 7% experienced Grade 4 anemia. Five percent of patients experienced febrile neutropenia. In Study IB12B following the first therapeutic dose, patients who experienced Grade 4 neutropenia reached neutrophil nadir at a median of 36 days (27 – 55 days) and remained at nadir for a median of 12 days (8 – 22 days) until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 3. Following the second dose, patients who experienced Grade 4 neutropenia reached nadir at a median of 43 days (38 – 47 days) and remained at nadir for a median of 18.5 days (8 – 31 days) until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 3.</p><p>Monitor blood cell counts weekly for up to 12 weeks or until levels return to baseline or the normal range. Withhold and dose reduce AZEDRA as recommended based on severity of the cytopenia <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Secondary Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Leukemia and Other Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemias were reported in 6.8% of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The time to development of MDS or acute leukemia ranged from 12 months to 7 years.</p><p>Two of the 88 patients developed a non-hematological malignancy. One patient developed colon cancer at 18 months and one patient developed lung adenocarcinoma at 27 months following the first therapeutic dose.</p><h3>Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First">Hypothyroidism was reported in 3.4% of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. The time to worsening of hypothyroidism was 4 months in one patient, and the time to development of hypothyroidism was less than one month in one patient and 18 months in one patient. Initiate thyroid-blocking medications starting at least 1 day before and continuing for 10 days after each AZEDRA dose to reduce the risk of hypothyroidism or thyroid neoplasia <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>. Evaluate for clinical evidence of hypothyroidism and measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels prior to initiating AZEDRA and annually thereafter.</p><h3>Elevations in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Eleven percent of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> experienced a worsening of pre-existing hypertension defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure to ≥160 mmHg with an increase of 20 mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure to ≥ 100 mmHg with an increase of 10 mmHg. All changes in blood pressure occurred within the first 24 hours post infusion. Monitor blood pressure frequently during the first 24 hours after each therapeutic dose of AZEDRA.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>, 7% developed renal failure or acute kidney injury and 22% demonstrated a clinically significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured at 6 or 12 months. Monitor renal function during and after treatment with AZEDRA. Patients with baseline renal impairment may be at greater risk of toxicity; perform more frequent assessments of renal function in patients with mild or moderate impairment. AZEDRA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min).</p><h3>Pneumonitis</h3><p class="First">Fatal pneumonitis occurred 9 weeks after a single dose in one patient in the expanded access program for Study IB12B (n=11). Pneumonitis was not diagnosed among the 88 patients enrolled in Study IB12 or IB12B <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span>6.1<span class="Italics">)]</span>. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and treat appropriately.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on its mechanism of action, AZEDRA can cause fetal harm. There are no available data on the use of AZEDRA in pregnant women. No animal studies using iobenguane I 131 have been conducted to evaluate its effect on female reproduction and embryo-fetal development; however, all radiopharmaceuticals, including AZEDRA, have the potential to cause fetal harm.</p><p>Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating AZEDRA <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p>Advise females and males of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AZEDRA and for 7 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the final dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), (8.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Infertility</h3><p class="First">Radiation exposure associated with AZEDRA may cause infertility in males and females. The recommended cumulative dose of 37 GBq of AZEDRA results in a radiation absorbed dose to the testes and ovaries within the range where temporary or permanent infertility can be expected following external beam radiotherapy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data in Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to AZEDRA in 88 patients with iobenguane-scan positive recurrent or unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL) who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA in one of two clinical studies (IB12 or IB12B). The Warnings and Precautions also include data from 11 patients enrolled in an expanded access program for Study IB12B <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</p><p>The safety data below was evaluated in two studies in patients with recurrent or unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL. Study IB12 was an open-label, multi-center, single-arm dose-finding study in adult patients with malignant or recurrent PPGL. The study consisted of a 12-month efficacy phase with a 1 year follow-up. Twenty-one patients received a dosimetric dose (~5 mCi), followed by one therapeutic dose (~500 mCi) of AZEDRA. Study IB12B was an open-label, multi-center, single-arm study in 68 adult and pediatric patients age 12 years and older with recurrent or unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PPGL <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>Patients with evidence of liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase ≥ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal), a history of liver disease (including hepatitis and chronic alcohol abuse), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min) were excluded. Patients who had received external beam radiation to &gt; 25% of bone marrow, received whole body radiotherapy, or who had received any systemic radiotherapy resulting in myelosuppression within 3 months of study entry, were also excluded. The safety data described below are based on pooled safety data from studies IB12 and IB12B. A total of 88 patients received at least one therapeutic dose of AZEDRA and 50 patients received two therapeutic doses (one patient received treatment in both studies).</p><p>Adverse reactions from studies IB12 and IB12B are presented in Table 5. The most common severe (Grade 3-4) adverse reactions were lymphopenia (78%), neutropenia (59%), thrombocytopenia (50%), fatigue (26%), anemia (24%), increased international normalized ratio (18%), nausea (16%), dizziness (13%), hypertension (11%), and vomiting (10%).

The drug substance iobenguane I 131 is a substituted benzylguanidine with I 131 in the meta position of the benzene ring.</p><p>Iobenguane I 131 is described as I 131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine. The molecular weight is 279.1 Daltons and the structural formula is as follows:</p><p></p><p>AZEDRA (iobenguane I 131) 555 MBq/mL (15 mCi/mL) injection is a sterile, clear, colorless to pale yellow solution. Each single-dose vial contains iobenguane (0.006 mg/mL), sodium ascorbate (58 mg/mL) and sodium gentisate (23 mg/mL) in Water for Injection, USP. The pH range of the solution is 4.5 to 5.5, with specific activity of ~2,500 mCi/mg (92,500 MBq/mg).</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><p class="First">I 131 decays with beta and gamma emissions with a physical half-life of 8.021 days. The principal beta emission has a mean energy of 191.6 keV, and the principal gamma emission has energy of 364.5 keV.</p><h3>External Radiation</h3><p class="First">The specific gamma ray constant for I 131 is 2.2 R/mCi hour at 1 cm. A 2.55 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1,000.</p><p>Table 6 summarizes radioactive decay properties of I 131.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Calibration day.</p><h2>Azedra Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">AZEDRA is an I 131 labeled iobenguane. Iobenguane is similar in structure to the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and is subject to the same uptake and accumulation pathways as NE. Iobenguane is taken up by the NE transporter in adrenergic nerve terminals and accumulates in adrenergically innervated tissues, such as the heart, lungs, adrenal medulla, salivary glands, liver, and spleen as well as tumors of neural crest origin. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are tumors of neural crest origin that express high levels of the NE transporter on their cell surfaces. Following intravenous administration, AZEDRA is taken up and accumulates within pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma cells, and radiation resulting from radioactive decay of I 131 causes cell death and tumor necrosis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The effect of AZEDRA on the QTc interval was evaluated in 74 patients with unresectable pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. At the recommended therapeutic dosage, no large mean increases from baseline in the QTc interval (i.e., &gt;20 ms) were detected.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics (PK) of iobenguane I 131 following a dosimetric dose were characterized in patients with malignant PPGL and other malignancies. The mean blood area under curve (AUC) of iobenguane I 131 at the recommended dosimetric dose is 1 µCi*h/mL (CV 33%). The mean maximum concentration (Cmax) for iobenguane I 131 is 0.06 µCi/mL (CV 36%), which generally occurred at the end of the AZEDRA infusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The volume of distribution (mean ± SD) of iobenguane I 131 is 2893 ± 592 mL/kg. The blood levels of radioactivity declined with a distribution half-life (mean ± SD) of 0.37 ± 0.22 hours. The non-radioactive form of iobenguane I 131 is 61% to 63% bound to human plasma proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The mean clearance is 62 ± 24 mL/hr/kg for iobenguane I 131 and the mean terminal blood half-life is 35 ± 14 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Iobenguane I 131 does not undergo hepatic metabolism.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Iobenguane I 131 is primarily eliminated renally with cumulative excretion of 50 ± 10% within 24 hours and 80 ± 10% within 120 hours following AZEDRA administration. Unchanged I 131 accounted for an average of 94% and 93% radioactivity excreted in urine collected at 0-6 and 6-24 hours post-dose, respectively. Minor metabolites detected in some patients included free I 131, quantifiable in 55% of 11 patients in Study IB11, as well as meta-iodohippuric acid (MIHA) and meta-iodobenzyl bisguanidine (MMIBG) quantifiable in one patient each.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Eight of 42 patients (19%) with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr ≥ 30-89 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault) required therapeutic dose reductions based on radiation dose estimates to critical organs exceeding Emami limits (absorbed renal dose exceeding 23 Gy). The pharmacokinetics of iobenguane I 131 has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt; 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span>8.6<span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In Vitro Studies</span></p><p>The non-radioactive form of iobenguane does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A. It does not induce CYP1A, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A. It is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies with iobenguane I 131 have not been conducted; however, radiation is a carcinogen and a mutagen. No animal studies were conducted to determine the effects of iobenguane I 131 on fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of AZEDRA in patients with iobenguane scan-positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL) which require systemic anticancer therapy was established in Study IB12B, an open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial (NCT00874614). Patients were at least 12 years of age and were ineligible for curative therapy. Patients also progressed on prior therapy for PPGL or were not candidates for chemotherapy. Other eligibility criteria required patients’ tumors to have definitive iobenguane avidity; at least one tumor site identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or iobenguane I 131 scan; Karnofsky performance status ≥60; absence of active central nervous system lesions, and no changes to their antihypertensive regimen in the 30 days prior to the first therapeutic dose.</p><p>The major efficacy outcome measure was the proportion of patients who experienced a 50% or greater reduction of all antihypertensive medication(s) lasting for at least six months (28 days per month). Overall tumor response measured by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0) was also evaluated. After the final 12-month assessment, patients entered into long-term follow-up for up to 4 additional years.</p><p>A total of 74 patients received the dosimetric dose of AZEDRA. Following dosimetry, 68 patients received at least one therapeutic dose and 50 patients received two therapeutic doses administered at least 90 days apart. The dosimetric dose was 185 mBq to 222 MBq (5 mCi to 6 mCi) for patients weighing &gt; 50 kg and 3.7 MBq/kg (0.1 mCi/kg) for patients weighing ≤ 50 kg. The therapeutic dose was 18,500 MBq (500 mCi) for patients weighing &gt; 62.5 kg and 296 MBq/kg (8 mCi/kg) for patients weighing ≤ 62.5 kg. Among the 68 patients, the median age was 55 years (16 to 72 years), 57% were male, 75% were White, 21% were Black, and 4% were Asian. For the primary tumor diagnosis, 78% had pheochromocytoma, 21% had paraganglioma, and 1% had both. Fifty percent (50%) of patients with evaluable imaging studies had lung or liver metastases and 61% had bone metastases at baseline. Eighty-eight percent (88%) underwent prior surgery, 50% received prior external radiation, 31% received prior I 131 MIBG, 31% received prior chemotherapy, 15% received prior kinase inhibitors and 4% received other prior systemic therapies. The median (range) of prior therapies per patient is 2 (0, 7).</p><p>The efficacy results are summarized in Table 7.
