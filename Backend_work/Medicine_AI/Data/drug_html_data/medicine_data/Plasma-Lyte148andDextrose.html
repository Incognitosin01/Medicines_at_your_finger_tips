</ul><h2>Plasma-Lyte 148 and Dextrose Description</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution for fluid and electrolyte replenishment and caloric supply in a single dose container for intravenous administration. Each 100 mL contains 5 g Dextrose Hydrous, USP*, 526 mg Sodium Chloride, USP (NaCl); 502 mg Sodium Gluconate (C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>NaO<span class="Sub">7</span>); 368 mg Sodium Acetate Trihydrate, USP (C<span class="Sub">2</span>H<span class="Sub">3</span>NaO<span class="Sub">2</span>•3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O), 37 mg Potassium Chloride, USP (KCl); and 30 mg Magnesium Chloride, USP (MgCl<span class="Sub">2</span>•6H<span class="Sub">2</span>O). It contains no antimicrobial agents. The pH is 5.0 (4.0 to 6.5). The pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid.</p><p>Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) administered intravenously has value as a source of water, electrolytes, and calories. One liter has an ionic concentration of 140 mEq sodium, 5 mEq potassium, 3 mEq magnesium, 98 mEq chloride, 27 mEq acetate and 23 mEq gluconate. The osmolarity is 547 mOsmol/L (calc). Normal physiologic osmolarity range is approximately 280 to 310 mOsmol/L. Administration of substantially hypertonic solutions (≥ 600 mOsmol/L) may cause vein damage. The caloric content is 190 kcal/L.</p><p>The Viaflex® plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride (PL 146® Plastic). The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials.</p><h2>Plasma-Lyte 148 and Dextrose - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) has value as a source of water, electrolytes, and calories. It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.</p><p>Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) produces a metabolic alkalinizing effect. Acetate and gluconate ions are metabolized ultimately to carbon dioxide and water, which requires the consumption of hydrogen cations.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Plasma-Lyte 148 and Dextrose</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) is indicated as a source of water, electrolytes, and calories, or as an alkalinizing agent.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with known allergy to corn or corn products.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention.</p><p>Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present.</p><p>Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. The administration of acetate or gluconate ions should be done with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of these ions, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><p>The intravenous administration of Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states, or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injection. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injection.</p><p>In patients with diminished renal function, administration of Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) may result in sodium or potassium retention.</p><h2>GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First">Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.</p><p>Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.</p><p>Caution must be exercised in the administration of Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.</p><p>Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) should be used with caution in patients with overt or subclinical diabetes mellitus.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP). It is also not known whether Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well controlled trials, however, the use of plasmalyte and dextrose solutions in the pediatric population is referenced in the medical literature. The warnings, precautions and adverse reactions identified in the label copy should be observed in the pediatric population.</p><p>In very low birth weight infants, excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible hemorrhage.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Studies with Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or effects on fertility.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) is administered to a nursing mother.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Plasma-Lyte® 148 and 5% Dextrose Injection (Multiple Electrolytes and Dextrose Injection, Type 1, USP) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy.</p><p>Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.</p><p>If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures, and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.</p><h2>Plasma-Lyte 148 and Dextrose Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">As directed by a physician. Dosage is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical condition of the patient as well as laboratory determinations.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p><p>All injections in Viaflex® plastic containers are intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment.</p><p>As reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia.</p><p>Additives may be incompatible.
