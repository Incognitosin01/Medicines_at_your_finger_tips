</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in Adults</span></p><p>More than 2,000 adult subjects with HIV-1 infection have been treated with emtricitabine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents for periods of 10 days to 200 weeks in clinical trials.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) identified from any of the three large, controlled clinical trials include headache, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, rash, abdominal pain, asthenia, increased cough, and rhinitis.</p><p>In Trials 301A and 303, the most common adverse reactions that occurred in subjects receiving emtricitabine with other antiretroviral agents were headache, diarrhea, nausea, and rash, which were generally mild to moderate. Approximately 1% of subjects discontinued participation in the clinical trials due to these events. All adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in emtricitabine and control treatment groups except for skin discoloration, which was reported with higher frequency in the emtricitabine treated group.</p><p>Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms or soles, was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown.</p><p>A summary of emtricitabine treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions in Trials 301A and 303 is provided in Table 2.</p><p class="First Footnote">AZT=zidovudine; d4T=stavudine; NNRTI/PI=non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor/protease inhibitor;</p><p class="First Footnote">3TC=lamivudine; EFV=efavirenz.</p><p class="First Footnote">a.

The adverse reaction profile in pediatric subjects was generally comparable to that observed in clinical trials of emtricitabine in adult subjects <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Hyperpigmentation was more frequent in children. Additional adverse reactions identified from this trial include anemia.</p><p>Selected treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of causality, reported in subjects during 48 weeks of treatment were the following: infection (44%), hyperpigmentation (32%), increased cough (28%), vomiting (23%), otitis media (23%), rash (21%), rhinitis (20%), diarrhea (20%), fever (18%), pneumonia (15%), gastroenteritis (11%), abdominal pain (10%), and anemia (7%). Treatment-emergent Grades 3-4 laboratory abnormalities were experienced by 9% of pediatric subjects, including elevated amylase (&gt;2.0 x ULN) (n=4), decreased neutrophils (&lt;750/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) (n=3), elevated ALT (&gt;5 x ULN) (n=2), elevated CPK (&gt;4 x ULN) (n=2) and one subject each with elevated bilirubin (&gt;3.0 x ULN), elevated GGT (&gt;10 x ULN), elevated lipase (&gt;2.5 x ULN), decreased hemoglobin (&lt;7 g/dL), and decreased glucose (&lt;40 mg/dL).</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">The potential for drug interactions with emtricitabine has been studied in combination with AZT, indinavir, d4T, famciclovir, and tenofovir DF (TDF). There were no clinically significant drug interactions for any of these drugs. Drug interactions trials are described elsewhere in the labeling <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to emtricitabine during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from the APR show no increase in the overall risk of major birth defects with first trimester exposure for emtricitabine (FTC) (2.3%) compared with the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in a U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. The rate of miscarriage for individual drugs is not reported in the APR. In the U.S., general population, the estimated background risk of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15–20%.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when FTC was administered at exposures ≥60 times that of the recommended daily dose of emtricitabine <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to FTC-containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 2,700 exposed in the first trimester and over 1,200 exposed in the second/third trimester), there was no increase between FTC and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in a U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2.4% (95% CI: 1.9% to 3.1%) with first trimester exposure to FTC-containing regimens and 2.3% (95% CI: 1.5% to 3.3%) with the second/third trimester exposure to FTC-containing regimens.</p><p>Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to FTC are compared with a U.S. background major birth defect rate. Methodologic limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group. Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations, as well as confounding due to the underlying disease.</p><p>Additionally, published observational studies on FTC exposure in pregnancy have not shown an increased risk for major malformations.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>FTC was administered orally to pregnant mice (at 0, 250, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day), and rabbits (at 0, 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day) through organogenesis (on gestation days 6 through 15, and 7 through 19, respectively). No significant toxicological effects were observed in embryo-fetal toxicity studies performed with FTC in mice at exposures (AUC) approximately 60 times higher and in rabbits at approximately 120 times higher than human exposures at the recommended daily dose. In a pre/postnatal development study in mice, FTC was administered orally at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day; no significant adverse effects directly related to drug were observed in the offspring exposed daily from before birth (in utero) through sexual maturity at daily exposures (AUC) of approximately 60 times higher than human exposures at the recommended daily dose.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1<span class="Bold">.</span> </p><p>Based on published data, FTC has been shown to be present in human breast milk. It is not known if FTC affects milk production or has effects on the breastfed child.</p><p>Because of the potential for: (1) HIV transmission (in HIV-negative infants); (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants); and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are taking emtricitabine.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of FTC in patients between 3 months and 21 years of age is supported by data from three open-label, nonrandomized clinical trials in which FTC was administered to 169 HIV-1 infected treatment-naive and experienced (defined as virologically suppressed on a 3TC containing regimen for which FTC was substituted for 3TC) subjects <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span>.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of FTC were studied in 20 neonates born to HIV-1 positive mothers <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span>. All neonates were HIV-1 negative at the end of the trial; the efficacy of FTC in preventing or treating HIV-1 could not be determined.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of emtricitabine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, keeping in mind the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Modify the dose or dosing interval for emtricitabine in patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min or in patients with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity, and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary.</p><p>Hemodialysis treatment removes approximately 30% of the FTC dose over a 3-hour dialysis period starting within 1.5 hours of FTC dosing (blood flow rate of 400 mL/min and a dialysate flow rate of 600 mL/min). It is not known whether FTC can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.</p><h2>Emtricitabine Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase.</p><p>The chemical name of emtricitabine is 5-fluoro-1-(2<span class="Italics">R</span>,5<span class="Italics">S</span>)-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine. Emtricitabine is the (-) enantiomer of a thio analog of cytidine, which differs from other cytidine analogs in that it has a fluorine in the 5-position.</p><p>It has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">8</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S and a molecular weight of 247.24. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Emtricitabine is a white to off-white powder with a solubility of approximately 112 mg/mL in water at 25 ºC. The log P for FTC is -0.43 and the pKa is 2.65.</p><p>Emtricitabine Capsules are for oral administration. Each capsule contains 200 mg of emtricitabine and the inactive ingredients, mannitol, hypromellose, and magnesium stearate. The capsule shell contains the following inactive ingredients and dyes: FD&amp;C blue 1, titanium dioxide, gelatin, and sodium lauryl sulfate. The capsules are printed with ink containing black iron oxide.</p><h2>Emtricitabine Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Emtricitabine is an antiretroviral drug <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of FTC were evaluated in healthy subjects and HIV- 1-infected subjects. Emtricitabine pharmacokinetics are similar between these populations.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the mean steady-state plasma FTC concentration-time profile in 20 HIV-1-infected subjects receiving Emtricitabine Capsules.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1 Mean (± 95% CI) Steady-State Plasma FTC Concentrations in HIV-1-Infected Adults (N=20)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Emtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 1-2 hours postdose. Following multiple dose oral administration of Emtricitabine Capsules to 20 HIV-1 infected subjects, the (mean ± SD) steady-state plasma FTC peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 1.8 ± 0.7 µg/mL and the area-under the plasma concentration-time curve over a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC) was 10.0 ± 3.1 µg•hr/mL. The mean steady-state plasma trough concentration at 24 hours postdose was 0.09 µg/mL. The mean absolute bioavailability of Emtricitabine Capsules was 93%, while the mean absolute bioavailability of emtricitabine oral solution was 75%. The relative bioavailability of emtricitabine oral solution was approximately 80% of Emtricitabine Capsules.</p><p>The multiple dose pharmacokinetics of FTC are dose proportional over a dose range of 25-200 mg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> binding of FTC to human plasma proteins was less than 4% and independent of concentration over the range of 0.02-200 µg/mL. At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to blood drug concentration ratio was ~1.0 and the mean semen to plasma drug concentration ratio was ~4.0.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Following administration of radiolabelled FTC, complete recovery of the dose was achieved in urine (~86%) and feces (~14%). Thirteen percent (13%) of the dose was recovered in urine as three putative metabolites. The biotransformation of FTC includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulfoxide diastereomers (~9% of dose) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (~4% of dose). No other metabolites were identifiable.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The plasma FTC half-life is approximately 10 hours. The renal clearance of FTC is greater than the estimated creatinine clearance, suggesting elimination by both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. There may be competition for elimination with other compounds that are also renally eliminated.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects of Food on Oral Absorption</span></p><p>Emtricitabine Capsules may be taken with or without food. Emtricitabine systemic exposure (AUC) was unaffected while C<span class="Sub">max</span> decreased by 29% when Emtricitabine Capsules were administered with food (an approximately 1000 kcal high-fat meal).</p><p><span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of FTC have not been fully evaluated in the elderly (65 years of age and older).</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of FTC at steady state were determined in 77 HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects, and the pharmacokinetic profile was characterized in four age groups (Table 6).

FTC did not inhibit the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation (uridine-5'-disphosphoglucuronyl transferase). Based on the results of these <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> experiments and the known elimination pathways of FTC, the potential for CYP-mediated interactions involving FTC with other medicinal products is low.</p><p>Emtricitabine has been evaluated in healthy volunteers in combination with TDF, AZT, indinavir, famciclovir, and d4T.

FTC-TP is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, ε, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.</p><p><span class="Italics">Antiviral Activity</span></p><p>The antiviral activity of FTC against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the MAGI-CCR5 cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The 50% effective concentration (EC<span class="Sub">50</span>) values for FTC were in the range of 0.0013-0.64 μM (0.0003-0.158 µg/mL). The median EC<span class="Sub">50</span>, range, and number of isolates for the laboratory isolates were 0.07, 0.009−0.62, 10; 0.011, 0.002−0.03, 12; 0.055, 0.0015−0.09, 4 respectively for lymphoblastoid, PBMC, and reporter cells. The median EC<span class="Sub">50</span>, range, and number of isolates for the clinical isolates were 0.05, 0.0105−0.64, 15; 0.015, 0.004−0.028, 6 respectively for lymphoblastoid cells and PBMCs. No antagonism was observed in drug combination studies of emtricitabine with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (abacavir, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine), and protease inhibitors (amprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir). FTC displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G (EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values ranged from 0.007-0.075 μM) and showed strain-specific activity against HIV-2 (EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values ranged from 0.007-1.5 μM in PBMCs and MAGI cells).</p><p><span class="Italics">Resistance</span></p><p>FTC-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been selected in cell culture and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>. Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed that the reduced susceptibility to FTC was associated with a valine or isoleucine (M184V/I) substitution in the HIV-1 RT.</p><p>FTC-resistant isolates of HIV-1 have been recovered from some subjects treated with FTC alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents. In a clinical trial of treatment-naive subjects treated with emtricitabine, didanosine, and efavirenz (EFV) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>, viral isolates from 37.5% of subjects with virologic failure showed reduced susceptibility to FTC. Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed that the resistance was due to M184V/I substitutions in the HIV-1 RT.</p><p>In a clinical trial of treatment-naive subjects treated with either emtricitabine, TDF, and EFV or AZT/3TC and EFV <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>, resistance analysis was performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with greater than 400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation. Development of EFV resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the treatment arms. The M184V amino acid substitution, associated with resistance to emtricitabine and 3TC, was observed in 2/19 analyzed subject isolates in the emtricitabine + TDF group and in 10/29 analyzed subject isolates in the AZT/3TC group. Through 144 weeks of Trial 934, no subjects have developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cross Resistance</span></p><p>Cross-resistance among certain NRTIs has been recognized. FTC-resistant isolates (M184V/I) were cross-resistant to 3TC but retained susceptibility in cell culture to AZT, didanosine, d4T, and tenofovir, and to NNRTIs (delavirdine, EFV, and nevirapine). HIV-1 isolates containing the K65R substitution, selected <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> by abacavir, didanosine, and tenofovir, demonstrated reduced susceptibility to inhibition by FTC. Viruses harboring substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to AZT and d4T (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219Q/E) or didanosine (L74V) remained sensitive to FTC. HIV-1 containing the K103N substitution associated with resistance to NNRTIs was susceptible to FTC.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">In long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of FTC, no drug-related increases in tumor incidence were found in mice at doses up to 750 mg/kg/day (26 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose of 200 mg/day) or in rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day (31 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose).</p><p>Emtricitabine was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test (Ames test) or mouse lymphoma or mouse micronucleus assays.</p><p>Emtricitabine did not affect fertility in male rats at approximately 140-fold or in male and female mice at approximately 60-fold higher exposures (AUC) than in humans given the recommended 200 mg daily dose. Fertility was normal in the offspring of mice exposed daily from before birth (in utero) through sexual maturity at daily exposures (AUC) of approximately 60-fold higher than human exposures at the recommended 200 mg daily dose.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Overview of Clinical Trials</h3><p class="First">The efficacy and safety of emtricitabine were evaluated in the trials summarized in Table 10.</p><p class="First Footnote">a.

From Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial, subjects received FTC/TDF fixed-dose combination with EFV in place of emtricitabine + TDF with EFV. Subjects had a mean age of 38 years (range 18-80); 86% were male, 59% were Caucasian, and 23% were Black. The mean baseline CD4<span class="Sup">+</span> cell count was 245 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> (range 2-1191) and median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 5.01 log<span class="Sub">10</span> copies/mL (range 3.56-6.54).

The difference in the proportion of subjects who achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL through 48 weeks largely results from the higher number of discontinuations due to adverse events and other reasons in the AZT/3TC group in this open-label trial. In addition, 80% and 70% of subjects in the emtricitabine + TDF group and the AZT/3TC group, respectively, achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL through Week 48 (64% and 56% through Week 144).
