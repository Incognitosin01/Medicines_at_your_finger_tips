Do not use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older. Use of enrofloxacin in this class of cattle may cause milk residues. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Swine</span>: Animals intended for human consumption must not be slaughtered within 5 days of receiving a single-injection dose.</p><h2>HUMAN WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For use in animals only. Keep out of the reach of children.</span> Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with copious amounts of water for 15 minutes. In case of dermal contact, wash skin with soap and water. Consult a physician if irritation persists following ocular or dermal exposures. Individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to quinolones should avoid this product. In humans, there is a risk of user photosensitization within a few hours after excessive exposure to quinolones. If excessive accidental exposure occurs, avoid direct sunlight.

The safety and efficacy of this formulation in species other than cattle and swine have not been determined.</p><p>Quinolone-class drugs should be used with caution in animals with known or suspected Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. In such animals, quinolones have, in rare instances, been associated with CNS stimulation which may lead to convulsive seizures. Quinolone-class drugs have been shown to produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. See Animal Safety section for additional information.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">No adverse reactions were observed during clinical trials.</p><h2>MICROBIOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Enrofloxacin is bactericidal and exerts its antibacterial effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase (a type II topoisomerase) thereby preventing DNA supercoiling and replication which leads to cell death.<span class="Sup">1</span> Enrofloxacin is active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.</p><h2>EFFECTIVENESS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cattle</span>: A total of 845 calves with naturally-occurring BRD were treated with Baytril® 100 in eight field trials located in five cattle-feeding states. Response to treatment was compared to non-treated controls. Single-dose and multiple-day therapy regimens were evaluated. BRD and mortality were significantly reduced in enrofloxacin-treated calves. No adverse reactions were reported in treated animals.</p><p><span class="Bold">Swine</span>: A total of 590 pigs were treated with Baytril®100 or saline in two separate natural infection SRD field trials. For the treatment of SRD, the success rate of enrofloxacin-treated pigs that were defined as “sick and febrile” (increased respiratoryrate, labored or dyspneic breathing, depressed attitude and a rectal temperature ≥104.0°F) was statistically significantly greater than the success rate of saline-treated “sick and febrile” pigs. For the control of SRD, mean rectal temperature, mortality (one trial) and morbidity were statistically significantly lower for enrofloxacin-treated pigs in pens containing a percentage of “sick and febrile” pigs compared to saline-treated pigs.</p><h2>TOXICOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">The oral LD50 for laboratory rats was greater than 5000 mg/kg of body weight. Ninety-day feeding studies in dogs and rats revealed no observable adverse effects at treatment rates of 3 and 40 mg/kg respectively. Chronic studies in rats and mice revealed no observable adverse effects at 5.3 and 323 mg/kg respectively. There was no evidence of carcinogenic effect in laboratory animal models. A two-generation rat reproduction study revealed no effect with 10 mg/kg treatments. No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits at doses of 25 mg/kg or in rats at 50 mg/kg.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cattle</span>: Safety studies were conducted in feeder calves using single doses of 5, 15 and 25 mg/kg for 15 consecutive days and 50 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed when a dose of 5 mg/kg was administered for 15 days. Clinical signs of depression, incoordination and muscle fasciculation were observed in calves when doses of 15 or 25 mg/kg were administered for 10 to 15 days. Clinical signs of depression, inappetance and incoordination were observed when a dose of 50 mg/kg was administered for 3 days. No drug-related abnormalities in clinical pathology parameters were identified. No articular cartilage lesions were observed after examination of stifle joints from animals administered 25 mg/kg for 15 days.</p><p>A safety study was conducted in 23-day-old calves using doses of 5, 15 and 25 mg/kgfor 15 consecutive days. No clinical signs of toxicity or changes in clinical pathology parameters were observed. No articular cartilage lesions were observed inthe stifle joints at any dose level at 2 days and 9 days following 15 days of drug administration.</p><p>An injection site study conducted in feeder calves demonstrated that the formulation may induce a transient reaction in the subcutaneous tissue and underlying muscle. No painful responses to administration were observed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Swine</span>: A safety study was conducted in 32 pigs weighing approximately 57 kg (125 lb) using single doses of 5, 15, or 25 mg/kg daily for 15 consecutive days. Incidental lameness of short duration was observed in all groups, including the saline-treated controls. Musculoskeletal stiffness was observed following the 15 and 25 mg/kg treatments with clinical signs appearing during the second week of treatment. Clinical signs of lameness improved after treatment ceased and most animals were clinically normal at necropsy.</p><p>A second study was conducted in two pigs weighing approximately 23 kg (50 lb), treated with 50 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days. There were no clinical signs of toxicity or pathological changes.</p><p>An injection site study conducted in pigs demonstrated that the formulation may induce a transient reaction in the subcutaneous tissue. No painful responses to administration were observed.</p><h2>STORAGE CONDITIONS:</h2><p class="First">Protect from direct sunlight. Do not refrigerate, freeze or store at or above 40°C (104°F).
