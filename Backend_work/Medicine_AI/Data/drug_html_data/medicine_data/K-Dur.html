Potassium levels can be low as a result of a disease or from taking certain medicines, or after a prolonged illness with diarrhea or vomiting.</p><p>K-Dur may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use K-Dur if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia), or if you also take a "potassium-sparing" diuretic.</p><p>To be sure K-Dur is helping your condition, your blood may need to be tested often. Your heart rate may also be checked using an electrocardiograph or ECG (sometimes called an EKG) to measure electrical activity of the heart. This test will help your doctor determine how long to treat you with K-dur. Do not miss any scheduled appointments.</p><p>Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.</p><p>Do not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your doctor.
