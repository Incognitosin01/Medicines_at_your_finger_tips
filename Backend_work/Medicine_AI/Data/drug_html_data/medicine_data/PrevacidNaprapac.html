Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing substances in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever. Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor. It decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach.</p><p>Prevacid NapraPAC is used to treat symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The lansoprazole in Prevacid NapraPAC helps reduce the risk of stomach ulcers in people who may be at risk for them while receiving treatment with an NSAID.</p><p>Prevacid NapraPAC may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>The naproxen in Prevacid NapraPAC may cause life-threatening heart or circulation problems such as heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term. Do not use Prevacid NapraPAC just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have chest pain, weakness, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or problems with vision or balance.</p><p>Naproxen may also cause serious effects on the stomach or intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole). These conditions can be fatal and can occur without warning while you are taking Prevacid NapraPAC, especially in older adults.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of stomach bleeding such as black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds. Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other pain or arthritis medicine. Many medicines available over the counter contain naproxen or similar medicines (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or ketoprofen). Taking naproxen during the last 3 months of pregnancy may result in birth defects. Do not take Prevacid NapraPAC during pregnancy unless your doctor has told you to.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Prevacid NapraPAC if you are allergic to lansoprazole (Prevacid) or naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn, and others), or if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to aspirin or other NSAIDs.

Follow the directions on your prescription label.</p><p>Each package of Prevacid NapraPAC contains pills for 7 days of treatment (one lansoprazole capsule and two naproxen tablets per day). In most cases, you will take one lansoprazole (Prevacid) capsule and one naproxen (Naprosyn) tablet each morning before eating. The second naproxen tablet is then taken 12 hours later, without lansoprazole. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Do not crush, chew, break, or open the lansoprazole capsule. Swallow it whole. Breaking or opening the pill may cause too much of the drug to be released at one time.</p><p>To be sure Prevacid NapraPAC is not causing harmful effects, your blood may need to be tested often.
