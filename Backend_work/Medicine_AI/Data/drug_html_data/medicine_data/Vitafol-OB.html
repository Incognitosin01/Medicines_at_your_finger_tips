High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur.</p><p>Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease.</p><p>Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><p>The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency.</p><p>Avoid Overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children.</p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First">High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs.</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones.</p><p>Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions.</p><p>Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients should be counseled to disclose all medical conditions, including use of all medications, vitamins and supplements, pregnancy, and breast-feeding.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Not for pediatric use.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals, but generally at doses substantially higher than those in Vitafol<span class="Sup">®</span>-OB.
