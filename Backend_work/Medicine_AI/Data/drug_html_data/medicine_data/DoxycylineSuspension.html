</ul><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline monohydrate and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline monohydrate should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p><h2>Doxycyline Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic synthetically derived from oxytetracycline. The chemical designation is 4-(Dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,5,10,12,12a-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide monohydrate. Doxycycline monohydrate has the following structural formula:</p><p>C <span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">8</span>• H<span class="Sub">2</span>O M.W. 462.46</p><p>Doxycycline is a light-yellow crystalline powder. Doxycycline monohydrate is very slightly soluble in water.</p><p>Doxycycline has a high degree of lipoid solubility and a low affinity for calcium binding. It is highly stable in normal human serum. Doxycycline will not degrade into an epianhydro form.</p><p>Doxycycline for Oral Suspension USP contains the following inactive ingredients: confectioner’s sugar, D&amp;C red #27 aluminum lake, ethyl acetate, maltodextrin, methylparaben, microcrystalline cellulose/sodium carboxymethylcellulose, modified cornstarch, natural flavoring; propylparaben, simethicone emulsion and sucrose.</p><p>When reconstituted as directed each teaspoonful (5 mL) contains doxycycline monohydrate equivalent to 25 mg of doxycycline.</p><h2>Doxycyline Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree. They are concentrated by the liver in the bile, and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration.</p><p>Following a 200 mg dose, normal adult volunteers averaged peak serum levels of 2.6 mcg/mL of doxycycline at 2 hours decreasing to 1.45 mcg/mL at 24 hours. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40%/72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min.). This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1 to 5%/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min.). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.</p><p>Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including doxycycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracyclines is common.</p><ul>

The precise mechanism of action of the drug is not known.</p><h3>Susceptibility Tests</h3><p class="First">Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters give the most precise estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. One such standard procedure <span class="Sup">1</span> which has been recommended for use with disks to test susceptibility of organisms to doxycycline uses the 30 mcg tetracycline-class disk or the 30 mcg doxycycline disk. Interpretation involves the correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for tetracycline or doxycycline, respectively.</p><p>Reports from the laboratory giving results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg tetracycline-class disk or the 30 mcg doxycycline disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria:</p><p>A report of “Susceptible” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited by generally achievable blood levels. A report of “Intermediate” suggests that the organism would be susceptible if a high dosage is used or if the infection is confined to tissues and fluids in which high antimicrobial levels are attained. A report of “Resistant” indicates that achievable concentrations are unlikely to be inhibitory, and other therapy should be selected.</p><p>Standardized procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms. The 30 mcg tetracycline-class disk or the 30 mcg doxycycline disk should give the following zone diameters:</p><p class="First">Use a standardized dilution method <span class="Sup">2</span> (broth, agar, microdilution) or equivalent with tetracycline powder. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria:</p><p>As with standard diffusion techniques, dilution methods require the use of laboratory control organisms. Standard tetracycline powder should provide the following MIC values:</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Doxycyline Suspension</h2><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of Doxycycline for Oral Suspension USP and other antibacterial drugs, Doxycycline for Oral Suspension USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p class="First">Doxycycline for Oral Suspension USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:</p><ul>

See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span> section and <span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span> subsection of the <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span> section.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, EXCEPT FOR ANTHRAX, INCLUDING INHALATIONAL ANTHRAX (POST-EXPOSURE), UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><p>All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p>The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.</p><p>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><p>Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension in adults have been reported in individuals receiving tetracyclines. These conditions disappeared when the drug was discontinued.</p><p>Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy, when indicated.</p><p>Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of <span class="Italics">Plasmodium</span> strains.</p><p>Doxycycline does not suppress <span class="Italics">P. falciparum</span>’s sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas.</p><p>Prescribing doxycycline in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Patients taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis should be advised:</p><p>All patients taking doxycycline should be advised:</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including doxycycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When doxycycline is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">In venereal disease, when coexistent syphilis is suspected, dark field examinations should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months.</p><p>In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies, should be performed.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.</p><p>Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.</p><p>Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations.</p><p>Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by bismuth subsalicylate.</p><p>Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.</p><p>The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.</p><p>Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibiotics, oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors), and minocycline (thyroid tumors).</p><p>Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted, positive results in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline, oxytetracycline).</p><p>Doxycycline administered orally at dosage levels as high as 250 mg/kg/day had no apparent effect on the fertility of female rats. Effect on male fertility has not been studied.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><h3>Teratogenic Effects</h3><p class="First">There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of doxycycline in pregnant women. The vast majority of reported experience with doxycycline during human pregnancy is short-term, first trimester exposure. There are no human data available to assess the effects of long-term therapy of doxycycline in pregnant women such as that proposed for treatment of anthrax exposure. An expert review of published data on experiences with doxycycline use during pregnancy by TERIS – the Teratogen Information System – concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (the quantity and quality of data were assessed as limited to fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk <span class="Sup">a</span>. A case-control study (18,515 mothers of infants with congenital anomalies and 32,804 mothers of infants with no congenital anomalies) shows a weak but marginally statistically significant association with total malformations and use of doxycycline anytime during pregnancy. Sixty-three (0.19%) of the controls and fifty-six (0.30%) of the cases were treated with doxycycline.</p><p>This association was not seen when the analysis was confined to maternal treatment during the period of organogenesis (i.e., in the second and third months of gestation) with the exception of a marginal relationship with neural tube defect based on only two exposed cases <span class="Sup">b</span>.</p><p>A small prospective study of 81 pregnancies describes 43 pregnant women treated for 10 days with doxycycline during early first trimester. All mothers reported their exposed infants were normal at 1 year of age <span class="Sup">c</span>.</p><p class="First">(see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>)</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk; however, the extent of absorption of tetracyclines, including doxycycline, by the breastfed infant is not known. Short-term use by lactating women is not necessarily contraindicated; however, the effects of prolonged exposure to doxycycline in breast milk are unknown <span class="Sup">d</span>. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from doxycycline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">(see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>)</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Due to oral doxycycline’s virtually complete absorption, side effects of the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines:</p><p>Gastrointestinal: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>Skin: maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Renal toxicity: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions: urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><p>Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported.</p><p>Other: bulging fontanels in infants and intracranial hypertension in adults (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>, <span class="Bold">General</span>).</p><p>When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. No abnormalities of thyroid function studies are known to occur.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage.</p><h2>Doxycyline Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Adults: The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours.</p><p>In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.</p><p>For children above eight years of age: The recommended dosage schedule for children weighing 100 pounds or less is 2 mg/lb of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by 1 mg/lb of body weight given as a single daily dose or divided into two doses, on subsequent days. For more severe infections up to 2 mg/lb of body weight may be used. For children over 100 lb the usual adult dose should be used.</p><p>The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage.</p><p>When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.</p><p>Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><p>If gastric irritation occurs, it is recommended that doxycycline be given with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk.</p><p>Studies to date have indicated that administration of doxycycline at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of the antibiotic in patients with renal impairment.</p><p>Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults (except anorectal infections in men): 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.

Use child-resistant closure (as required).</p><p>Store dry powder at 20° to 25° C (68° to 77° F). [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><h2>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Hyperpigmentation of the thyroid has been produced by members of the tetracycline class in the following species: in rats by oxytetracycline, doxycycline, tetracycline PO <span class="Sub">4</span>, and methacycline; in minipigs by doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline PO<span class="Sub">4</span>, and methacycline; in dogs by doxycycline and minocycline; in monkeys by minocycline.</p><p>Minocycline, tetracycline PO <span class="Sub">4</span>, methacycline, doxycycline, tetracycline base, oxytetracycline HCl, and tetracycline HCl were goitrogenic in rats fed a low iodine diet. This goitrogenic effect was accompanied by high radioactive iodine uptake. Administration of minocycline also produced a large goiter with high radioiodine uptake in rats fed a relatively high iodine diet.</p><p>Treatment of various animal species with this class of drugs has also resulted in the induction of thyroid hyperplasia in the following: in rats and dogs (minocycline); in chickens (chlortetracycline); and in rats and mice (oxytetracycline). Adrenal gland hyperplasia has been observed in goats and rats treated with oxytetracycline.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">Manufactured By: Iss. 2/2008</p><p>TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA</p><p>Sellersville, PA 18960</p><p><span class="Bold">DOXYCYCLINE</span></p><p><span class="Bold">for ORAL SUSPENSION USP</span></p><h2>PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL</h2><h3>Doxycycline for Oral Suspension USP 25 mg/5mL Label Text</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NDC</span> 0093-<span class="Bold">4170</span>-64</p><p>DOXYCYCLINE</p><p>for Oral Suspension USP</p><p><span class="Bold">25 mg/5mL*</span></p><p>When reconstituted as directed,</p><p><span class="Bold">each tablespoon (5 mL) contains doxycycline</span></p><p><span class="Bold">monohydrate equivalent to 25 mg of doxycycline.</span></p><p>RASPBERRY FLAVORED</p><p><span class="Bold">Rx only</span></p><p><span class="Bold">60 mL (when reconstituted)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">TEVA</span></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2><ul>
