Clinical Trials Experience</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">A lethal dose of gabapentin was not identified in mice and rats receiving single oral doses as high as 8000 mg/kg. Signs of acute toxicity in animals included ataxia, labored breathing, ptosis, sedation, hypoactivity, or excitation.</p><p>Acute oral overdoses of gabapentin up to 49 grams have been reported. In these cases, double vision, slurred speech, drowsiness, lethargy, and diarrhea were observed. All patients recovered with supportive care. Coma, resolving with dialysis, has been reported in patients with chronic renal failure who were treated with gabapentin.</p><p>Gabapentin can be removed by hemodialysis. Although hemodialysis has not been performed in the few overdose cases reported, it may be indicated by the patient’s clinical state or in patients with significant renal impairment.</p><p>If overexposure occurs, call your poison control center at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2>SmartRx Gaba-V Kit Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in gabapentin capsules, USP is gabapentin, USP which has the chemical name 1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid. The molecular formula of gabapentin is C 9H 17NO 2 and the molecular weight is 171.24. The structural formula of gabapentin is:</p><p>Gabapentin, USP is a white to off-white crystalline solid with a pK a1 of 3.7 and a pK a2 of 10.7. It is freely soluble in water and both basic and acidic aqueous solutions. The log of the partition coefficient (n-octanol/0.05M phosphate buffer) at pH 7.4 is –1.25.</p><p>Each gabapentin, USP capsule contains 100 mg, 300 mg, or 400 mg of gabapentin and the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch (corn), starch (corn) and talc. The 100 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide. The 300 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, and iron oxide yellow. The 400 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, FD&amp;C Yellow No.6 and FD&amp;C Blue No.1.</p><h2>SmartRx Gaba-V Kit - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Gabapentin was administered orally to mice and rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. No evidence of drug-related carcinogenicity was observed in mice treated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. At 2000 mg/kg, the plasma gabapentin exposure (AUC) in mice is approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD of 3600 mg/day. In rats, increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma and carcinoma were found in male rats receiving the highest dose (2000 mg/kg), but not at doses of 250 or 1000 mg/kg/day. At 1000 mg/kg, the plasma gabapentin exposure (AUC) in rats is approximately 5 times that in humans at the MRHD.</p><p>Studies designed to investigate the mechanism of gabapentin-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in rats indicate that gabapentin stimulates DNA synthesis in rat pancreatic acinar cells in vitro and, thus, may be acting as a tumor promoter by enhancing mitogenic activity. It is not known whether gabapentin has the ability to increase cell proliferation in other cell types or in other species, including humans.</p><p>Gabapentin did not demonstrate mutagenic or genotoxic potential in three in vitro and four in vivoassays. It was negative in the Ames test and the in vitro HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells; it did not produce significant increases in chromosomal aberrations in the in vitroChinese hamster lung cell assay; it was negative in the in vivo chromosomal aberration assay and in the in vivo micronucleus test in Chinese hamster bone marrow; it was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay; and it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in hepatocytes from rats given gabapentin.</p><p>No adverse effects on fertility or reproduction were observed in rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. At 2000 mg/kg, the plasma gabapentin exposure (AUC) in rats is approximately 8 times that in humans at the MRHD.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).</p><p>Administration Information</p><p>Inform patients that gabapentin is taken orally with or without food.</p><p>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity</p><p>Prior to initiation of treatment with gabapentin, instruct patients that a rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (such as fever or lymphadenopathy) may herald a serious medical event and that the patient should report any such occurrence to a physician immediately.</p><p>Anaphylaxis and Angioedema</p><p>Advise patients to discontinue gabapentin and seek medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema.</p><p>Dizziness and Somnolence and Effects on Driving and Operating Heavy Machinery</p><p>Advise patients that gabapentin may cause dizziness, somnolence, and other symptoms and signs of CNS depression. Other drugs with sedative properties may increase these symptoms. Accordingly, although patients’ ability to determine their level of impairment can be unreliable, advise them neither to drive a car nor to operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on gabapentin to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. Inform patients that it is not known how long this effect lasts.</p><p>Suicidal Thinking and Behavior</p><p>Counsel the patient, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including gabapentin, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Advise patients of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Instruct patients to report behaviors of concern immediately to healthcare providers.</p><p>Use in Pregnancy<br/>
<br/>
Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breast feeding or intend to breast feed during therapy.</p><p>Encourage patients to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy.
