It is known as an "essential" amino acid because the body does not produce it. Tryptophan is important to the functions of many organs in the body. When you consume tryptophan, your body absorbs it and changes it to eventually become a hormone called serotonin. Serotonin transmits signals between your nerve cells and also narrows (constricts) blood vessels. The amount of serotonin in the brain can affect mood.</p><p>Tryptophan has been used in alternative medicine as a possibly effective aid in treating symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder syndrome (such as mood swings and irritability), and to help people quit smoking.</p><p>Tryptophan has also been used to treat facial pain, to relieve bruxism (tooth grinding), and to improve athletic performance. However, research has shown that it may not be effective in treating these conditions.</p><p>Other uses not proven with research include treating sleep problems (insomnia), anxiety, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivty disorder (ADHD).</p><p>It is not certain whether tryptophan is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. It should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.</p><p>Tryptophan is often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.</p><p>It may be dangerous to purchase tryptophan on the Internet or from vendors outside of the United States. The manufacture, sale, and distribution of this products outside of the U.S. does not comply with the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the safe use of this medication.</p><p>Tryptophan may also be used for purposes not listed in this product guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on the product label and package.

All of these people had taken tryptophan distributed by a company in Japan. This product was found to contain trace levels of impure ingredients. Since that time, the FDA has limited the availability of tryptophan in the U.S. However, the increased use of the Internet has made many dietary supplements available from non-U.S. sources.</p><p><b>Although there have been no published cases of EMS within the last several years, you should be aware of the symptoms</b>.
