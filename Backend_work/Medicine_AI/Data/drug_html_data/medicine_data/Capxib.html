</ul><h2>CELECOXIB CAPSULES</h2><h2>Indications and Usage for Capxib</h2><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of celecoxib and other treatment options before deciding to use celecoxib capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals</p><h2>Capxib Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Use lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals for the individual patient.</p><p>These doses can be given without regard to timing of meals.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Capsules: 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Celecoxib capsules are contraindicated:</p><ul>
<li>In patients with known hypersensitivity to celecoxib, aspirin, or other NSAIDs.</li>
<li>In patients who have demonstrated allergic-type reactions to sulfonamides.</li>
<li>In patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe anaphylactoid reactions to NSAIDs, some of them fatal, have been reported in such patients.</li>
<li>For the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery</li>
</ul><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Of the celecoxib-treated patients in the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, approximately 4,250 were patients with OA, approximately 2,100 were patients with RA, and approximately 1,050 were patients with post-surgical pain. More than 8,500 patients received a total daily dose of celecoxib of 200 mg (100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily) or more, including more than 400 treated at 800 mg (400 mg twice daily). Approximately 3,900 patients received celecoxib at these doses for 6 months or more; approximately 2,300 of these have received it for 1 year or more and 124 of these have received it for 2 years or more.</p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">General: Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver. Co-administration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C9 should be done with caution. Significant interactions may occur when celecoxib is administered together with drugs that inhibit CYP2C9.</p><p>In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No overdoses of celecoxib were reported during clinical trials. Doses up to 2400 mg/day for up to 10 days in 12 patients did not result in serious toxicity. Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.</p><p>Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. No information is available regarding the removal of celecoxib by hemodialysis, but based on its high degree of plasma protein binding (&gt;97%) dialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><h2>Capxib Description</h2><p class="First">Celecoxib is chemically designated as 4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)- 3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl] benzenesulfonamide and is a diaryl-substituted pyrazole. The empirical formula is C17H14F3N3O2S, and the molecular weight is 381.38; the chemical structure is as follows:</p><p>Celecoxib capsules for oral administration contain either 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of celecoxib, together with inactive ingredients including: crospovidone, sodium lauryl sulphate, povidone, magnesium stearate. The capsule shell contains gelatin and titanium dioxide. The capsule imprinting ink for the 50 mg strength contains shellac, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sodium hydroxide, titanium dioxide, povidone and FD&amp;C Red #40 Aluminum Lake. The capsule imprinting ink for the 100 mg strength contains shellac, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, strong ammonia solution, and FD&amp;C Blue #2 Aluminum Lake. The capsule imprinting ink for the 200 mg strength contains shellac, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, propylene glycol, strong ammonia solution, iron oxide yellow, and dimethicone.</p><h2>Capxib - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h2>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><h2>HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First">Celecoxib capsules 50 mg are available for oral administration as hard gelatin capsules with a white opaque body and a white opaque cap. “APO C50” is imprinted on each capsule in red ink.
