If superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be initiated. Whenever clinical judgment dictates; the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, corneal staining.</p><h3>Information for patients</h3><p class="First">This product is sterile when packaged.

Statrol Ophthalmic Solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether these drugs are excreted in human milk.
