Do not take warfarin in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Take warfarin at the same time every day, with or without food. Never take a double dose.</p><p>Warfarin can make it easier for you to bleed. <b>Seek emergency help if you have any bleeding that will not stop.</b></p><p>You will need frequent "INR" or prothrombin time tests (to measure your blood-clotting time and determine your warfarin dose). You must remain under the care of a doctor while taking this medicine.</p><p>If you receive warfarin in a hospital, call or visit your doctor 3 to 7 days after you leave the hospital. Your INR will need to be tested at that time. Do not miss any follow-up appointments.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are sick with diarrhea, fever, chills, or flu symptoms, or if your body weight changes.</p><p>You may need to stop taking warfarin 5 to 7 days before having any surgery, dental work, or a medical procedure.

You may still bleed more easily for several days after you stop taking warfarin.</p><p>Avoid making any changes in your diet without first talking to your doctor. Foods that are high in vitamin K (liver, leafy green vegetables, or vegetable oils) can make warfarin less effective.

Avoid the use of these juice products while taking this medicine.</p><p>Avoid drinking alcohol.</p><p>Ask your doctor before using any medicine for pain, arthritis, fever, or swelling.
