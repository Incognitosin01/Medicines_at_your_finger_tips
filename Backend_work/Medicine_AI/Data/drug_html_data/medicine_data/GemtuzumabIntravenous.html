It is also used alone to treat CD33-positive AML that has come back (relapsed) or after other medicines did not work well (refractory).</p><p>Gemtuzumab is an antineoplastic (cancer) medicine. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by gemtuzumab, other side effects can occur. Before you begin treatment, talk to your doctor about the benefits of gemtuzumab as well as the possible risks of using it.</p><p>Gemtuzumab is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using gemtuzumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
