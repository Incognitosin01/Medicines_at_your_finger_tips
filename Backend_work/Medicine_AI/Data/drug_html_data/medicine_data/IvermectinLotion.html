</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ivermectin Lotion</h2><h3>Indication</h3><p class="First">Ivermectin Lotion is indicated for the topical treatment of head lice infestations in patients 6 months of age and older.</p><h3>Adjunctive Measures</h3><p class="First">Ivermectin Lotion should be used in the context of an overall lice management program:</p><ul>
<li>Wash (in hot water) or dry-clean all recently worn clothing, hats, used bedding and towels.</li>
<li>Wash personal care items such as combs, brushes and hair clips in hot water.</li>
<li>A fine-tooth comb or special nit comb may be used to remove dead lice and nits.</li>
</ul><h2>Ivermectin Lotion Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">For topical use only. Ivermectin Lotion is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><p>Apply Ivermectin Lotion to dry hair in an amount sufficient (up to 1 tube) to thoroughly coat the hair and scalp.</p><p>Leave Ivermectin Lotion on the hair and scalp for 10 minutes, and then rinse off with water. It is recommended to wait 24 hours before applying shampoo to hair and scalp.</p><p>The tube is intended for single use; discard any unused portion. Avoid contact with eyes.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Lotion: 0.5%; each gram of lotion contains 5 mg of ivermectin. Ivermectin Lotion is an off-white to tan lotion.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Ingestion in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">In order to prevent ingestion, Ivermectin Lotion should only be administered to pediatric patients under the direct supervision of an adult.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to a single 10 minute treatment of Ivermectin Lotion in 379 patients, ages 6 months and older, in placebo-controlled trials. Of these subjects, 47 subjects were age 6 months to 4 years, 179 subjects were age 4 to 12 years, 56 subjects were age 12 to 16 years and 97 subjects were age 16 or older. Adverse reactions, reported in less than 1% of subjects treated with Ivermectin Lotion, include conjunctivitis, ocular hyperemia, eye irritation, dandruff, dry skin, and skin burning sensation.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no studies with the use of Ivermectin Lotion in pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies with the use of oral ivermectin during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes, because either the timing of administration during gestation was not accurately ascertained or the administration occurred only during the second trimester <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. However, systemic exposure from topical use of ivermectin is much lower than that from oral use <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> In animal reproduction studies, ivermectin induced adverse developmental outcomes when orally administered to pregnant mice, rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis only at or near doses that were maternally toxic to the pregnant females <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Four published epidemiology studies, all performed in rural Africa to treat soil-transmitted helminths, evaluated pregnancy outcomes in a total of 744 women exposed to oral ivermectin in various stages of pregnancy. In the largest of these studies, 397 women in their second trimester of pregnancy were treated open-label with single doses of oral ivermectin, or ivermectin plus albendazole, for soil-transmitted helminths and compared with a pregnant, non-treated population. No differences in pregnancy outcomes were observed between treated and untreated populations. These studies cannot definitively establish or exclude the absence of any drug-associated risk during pregnancy, because either the timing of administration during gestation was not accurately ascertained or the administration occurred only during the second trimester.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>No comparisons of animal exposure with human exposure are made due to the low systemic exposure noted in the clinical pharmacokinetic study <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in mice, rats and rabbits. Oral doses of ivermectin at 0.1 mg/kg/day, 0.2 mg/kg/day, 0.4 mg/kg/day, 0.8 mg/kg/day, and 1.6 mg/kg/day were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female mice. Maternal death occurred at 0.4 mg/kg/day and above. Cleft palate occurred in the fetuses from the 0.4 mg/kg/day, 0.8 mg/kg/day, and 1.6 mg/kg/day groups. Exencephaly was seen in the fetuses from the 0.8 mg/kg group. Oral doses of ivermectin at 2.5 mg/kg/day, 5 mg/kg/day, and 10 mg/kg/day were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rats. Maternal death and pre-implantation loss occurred at 10 mg/kg/day. Cleft palate and wavy ribs were seen in fetuses from the 10 mg/kg/day group. Oral doses of ivermectin at 1.5 mg/kg/day, 3 mg/kg/day, and 6 mg/kg/day were administered during the period of organogenesis to pregnant female rabbits. Maternal toxicity and abortion occurred at 6 mg/kg/day. Cleft palate and clubbed forepaws occurred in the fetuses from the 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg groups. These teratogenic effects were found only at or near doses that were maternally toxic to the pregnant female. Therefore, ivermectin does not appear to be selectively fetotoxic to the developing fetus.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is information available on the presence of ivermectin in human milk in 4 lactating women after a single 150 mcg/kg oral dose of ivermectin. However, there is insufficient information from this study to determine the effects of ivermectin on the breastfed infant or the effects of ivermectin on milk production.</p><p>Topical ivermectin systemic exposure is much lower than that for oral ivermectin <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Furthermore, the amount of ivermectin present in human milk after topical application of ivermectin to lactating women has not been studied.</p><p>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Ivermectin Lotion and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Ivermectin Lotion or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Advise a lactating woman to avoid accidental transfer of Ivermectin Lotion to breast area where the infant might directly ingest the drug.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Ivermectin Lotion have been established for pediatric patients 6 months of age and older <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>The safety of Ivermectin Lotion has not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months. Ivermectin Lotion is not recommended in pediatric patients under 6 months of age because of the potential increased systemic absorption due to a high ratio of skin surface area to body mass and the potential for an immature skin barrier and risk of ivermectin toxicity.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Ivermectin Lotion did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In accidental or significant exposure to unknown quantities of veterinary formulations of ivermectin in humans, either by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or exposure to body surfaces, the following adverse effects have been reported most frequently: rash, edema, headache, dizziness, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects that have been reported include: seizure, ataxia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, paresthesia, urticaria, and contact dermatitis.</p><p>In case of accidental poisoning, supportive therapy, if indicated, should include parenteral fluids and electrolytes, respiratory support (oxygen and mechanical ventilation if necessary) and pressor agents if clinically significant hypotension is present. Induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage as soon as possible, followed by purgatives and other routine anti-poison measures, may be indicated if needed to prevent absorption of ingested material.</p><h2>Ivermectin Lotion Description</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin Lotion, for topical administration, is an off-white/tan lotion containing 0.5% ivermectin.</p><p>Ivermectin, the active ingredient, is a pediculicide, derived from the fermentation of a soil dwelling actinomycete, <span class="Italics">Streptomyces avermitilis.</span></p><p>Ivermectin is a mixture containing at least 90% 5-<span class="Italics">O</span>-demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A<span class="Sub">1a</span> and less than 10% 5-<span class="Italics">O</span>-demethyl-25-de(1-methylpropyl)-22,23-dihydro25-(1-methylethyl) avermectin A<span class="Sub">1a</span>, generally referred to as 22,23-dihydroavermectin B<span class="Sub">1a</span> and B<span class="Sub">1b</span>, or H<span class="Sub">2</span>B<span class="Sub">1a</span> and H<span class="Sub">2</span>B<span class="Sub">1b</span>, respectively. The respective empirical formulas are C<span class="Sub">48</span>H<span class="Sub">74</span>O<span class="Sub">14</span> and C<span class="Sub">47</span>H<span class="Sub">72</span>O<span class="Sub">14</span>, with molecular weights of 875.10 and 861.07, respectively. The structural formulas are:</p><p>Ivermectin Lotion contains the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxyanisole, castor oil, cetyl alcohol, citric acid anhydrous, crodalan AWS, cyclomethicone, glycerin, imidurea, lanolin alcohols, methylparaben, oleyl alcohol, olive oil, propylene glycol, propylparaben, purified water, shea butter, sodium citrate anhydrous, sorbitan tristearate and stearyl alcohol.</p><h2>Ivermectin Lotion - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Ivermectin, a member of the avermectin class, causes death of parasites, primarily through binding selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride channels, which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The selective activity of compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that some mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the avermectins have a low affinity for mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels, and ivermectin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier in humans.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacodynamics of Ivermectin Lotion are unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The absorption of ivermectin from Ivermectin Lotion was evaluated in a clinical study in subjects aged from 6 months to 3 years. This study evaluated pharmacokinetics in 20 lice infested subjects, and 13 of these subjects weighed 15 kg or less (overall weight range 8.5 to 23.9 kg). All enrolled subjects received a single treatment with Ivermectin Lotion. The systemic ivermectin exposure was evaluated using an assay with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.05 ng/mL. The mean (± standard deviation) plasma maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to time of last measurable concentration (AUC<span class="Sub">0-tlast</span>) were 0.24 ± 0.23 ng/mL and 6.7 ± 11.2 hr∙ng/mL, respectively. These levels are much lower than those observed following oral administration of 165 mcg/kg dose of ivermectin.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Ivermectin Lotion or ivermectin.</p><p>Ivermectin was not genotoxic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma assay, or the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in human fibroblasts.</p><p>Ivermectin had no adverse effects on fertility in rats at repeated oral doses of up to 3.6 mg/kg/day.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Two identical multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies were conducted in subjects 6 months of age and older with head lice infestation. All subjects received a single application of either Ivermectin Lotion or vehicle control with instructions not to use a nit comb. For the evaluation of efficacy, the youngest subject from each household was considered to be the index subject of the household (N=289). Other enrolled infested household members received the same treatment as the youngest subject and were evaluated for all safety parameters <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>The primary efficacy was assessed as the proportion of index subjects who were free of live lice at day 2 and through day 8 to the final evaluation 14 (+2) days following a single application. Subjects with live lice present at any time up to the final evaluation were considered treatment failures. Table 1 contains the proportion of subjects who were free of live lice in each of the two trials.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin Lotion, 0.5% is supplied in a 4 oz (117 g) white laminate tube (NDC 51672-4211-8).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F)</span> [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
