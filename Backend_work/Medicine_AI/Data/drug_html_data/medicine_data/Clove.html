When used as a food product, clove is not likely to produce health benefits or side effects. When used as a medicinal product, clove may produce both desired and unwanted effects on the body.</p><p>Clove has been used in alternative medicine as a possibly effective aid in treating premature ejaculation, when it is combined with other ingredients and applied to the outer skin of the penis before sexual intercourse.
