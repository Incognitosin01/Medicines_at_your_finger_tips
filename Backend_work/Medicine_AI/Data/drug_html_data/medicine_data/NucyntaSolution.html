</ul><h2>Nucynta Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering NUCYNTA oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. The oral solution contains 20 mg tapentadol per milliliter (mL), when writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume.</p><p>Always use the enclosed calibrated measuring syringe when administering NUCYNTA oral solution to ensure the dose is measured and administered accurately. An oral syringe is supplied with dose marks corresponding directly to 2.5 mL (equals 50 mg) oral solution, 3.75 mL (equals 75 mg) oral solution, and 5 mL (equals 100 mg) oral solution.</p><p>Do not use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure NUCYNTA oral solution, as using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon could lead to overdosage.</p><p>Inform patients of the availability of FDA-approved patient labeling, Instructions for Use, for step-by-step instructions for patients on how to use the medicine bottle and the oral syringe.</p><p>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)].</span></p><p>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with NUCYNTA and adjust the dosage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></p><h3>Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First">Initiate treatment with NUCYNTA oral solution in a dosing range of 50 mg (2.5 mL) to 100 mg (5 mL) every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain.</p><p>On the first day of dosing, the second dose may be administered as soon as one hour after the first dose, if adequate pain relief is not attained with the first dose. Subsequent dosing is 2.5 mL (equivalent to 50 mg), 3.75 mL (equivalent to 75 mg), or 5 mL (equivalent to 100 mg) every 4 to 6 hours and should be adjusted to maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable tolerability.</p><p>Daily doses greater than 700 mg on the first day of therapy and 600 mg on subsequent days have not been studied and are not recommended.</p><p>NUCYNTA oral solution may be given with or without food <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from NUCYNTA oral solution to NUCYNTA ER</span></p><p>Patients can be converted from NUCYNTA oral solution to NUCYNTA ER using the equivalent total daily dose of NUCYNTA oral solution and dividing it into two equal doses of NUCYNTA ER separated by approximately 12-hour intervals. As an example, a patient receiving 50 mg of NUCYNTA oral solution four times per day (200 mg/day) may be converted to 100 mg NUCYNTA ER twice a day.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of NUCYNTA oral solution has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score 10-15) and use in this population is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].</span></p><p>Initiate treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) with 50 mg no more frequently than once every 8 hours (maximum of three doses in 24 hours). Further treatment should reflect maintenance of analgesia with acceptable tolerability, to be achieved by either shortening or lengthening the dosing interval. Monitor closely for respiratory and central nervous system depression <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score 5 to 6) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Continually reevaluate patients receiving NUCYNTA oral solution to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span> Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.</p><p>If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the NUCYNTA oral solution dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><h3>Discontinuation of NUCYNTA oral solution</h3><p class="First">When a patient who has been taking NUCYNTA regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with NUCYNTA taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue NUCYNTA oral solution in a physically-dependent patient <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oral solution: 20 mg/mL in 100 mL and 200 mL fill bottles with child-resistant closure <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)</span> and <span class="Italics">How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">NUCYNTA oral solution is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Significant respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</li>
<li>Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
<li>Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including suspected paralytic ileus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span></li>
<li>Hypersensitivity to tapentadol (e.g. anaphylaxis, angioedema) or to any other ingredients of the product <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></li>
<li>Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. Avoid dosing errors that may result from confusion between mg and mL when prescribing, dispensing, and administering NUCYNTA oral solution. Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. Always use the <span class="Bold">enclosed</span> calibrated syringe when administering NUCYNTA to ensure the dose is measured and administered accurately. Do not use a teaspoon or a tablespoon to measure a dose. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the possibility of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, it is strongly recommended that caregivers obtain and use a calibrated measuring device. Health care providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage.</p><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">NUCYNTA oral solution contains tapentadol, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><p>As an opioid, NUCYNTA oral solution exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].</span></p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed NUCYNTA oral solution. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing NUCYNTA oral solution and monitor all patients receiving NUCYNTA oral solution for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as NUCYNTA oral solution, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of NUCYNTA oral solution along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing NUCYNTA oral solution. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span> Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Life Threatening-Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)].</span> Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of NUCYNTA oral solution, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of NUCYNTA oral solution.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of NUCYNTA oral solution are essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span> Overestimating the NUCYNTA oral solution dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of NUCYNTA oral solution, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of tapentadol.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of NUCYNTA oral solution during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of NUCYNTA oral solution with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., nonbenzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when NUCYNTA oral solution is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of NUCYNTA oral solution in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:</span> NUCYNTA oral solution-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of NUCYNTA oral solution <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:</span>Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span></p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating NUCYNTA<span class="Sup">®</span> and when NUCYNTA oral solution is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span> Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concurrent use of tapentadol with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g. mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). This may occur within the recommended dosage range.</p><p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and can be fatal <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span> The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue NUCYNTA oral solution if serotonin syndrome is suspected.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">NUCYNTA oral solution may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of NUCYNTA oral solution. In patients with circulatory shock, NUCYNTA oral solution may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of NUCYNTA oral solution in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), NUCYNTA oral solution may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with NUCYNTA oral solution.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of NUCYNTA oral solution in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">NUCYNTA oral solution is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The tapentadol in NUCYNTA oral solution may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The tapentadol in NUCYNTA oral solution may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during NUCYNTA oral solution therapy.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including NUCYNTA oral solution. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p>When discontinuing NUCYNTA oral solution in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span> Do not abruptly discontinue NUCYNTA in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].</span></p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">NUCYNTA oral solution may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of NUCYNTA oral solution and know how they will react to the medication.</p><h3>Interactions with Alcohol, Other Opioids, and Drugs of Abuse</h3><p class="First">Due to its mu-opioid agonist activity, NUCYNTA oral solution may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma or death <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol, other opioids, or drugs of abuse while on NUCYNTA oral solution therapy <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Risk of Toxicity in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">A study with NUCYNTA oral solution in subjects with hepatic impairment showed higher serum concentrations of tapentadol than in those with normal hepatic function. Avoid use of NUCYNTA oral solution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Reduce the dose of NUCYNTA oral solution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression when receiving NUCYNTA oral solution.</p><h3>Risk of Toxicity in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use of NUCYNTA oral solution in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended due to accumulation of a metabolite formed by glucuronidation of tapentadol. The clinical relevance of the elevated metabolite is not known <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed, or described in greater detail in other sections:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Based on data from nine Phase 2/3 studies that administered multiple doses (seven placebo- and/or active-controlled, one noncontrolled and one Phase 3 active-controlled safety study) the most common adverse reactions (reported by ≥10% in any NUCYNTA dose group) were: nausea, dizziness, vomiting and somnolence.</p><p>The most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions in the studies described above (reported by ≥1% in any NUCYNTA dose group) were dizziness (2.6% vs. 0.5%), nausea (2.3% vs. 0.6%), vomiting (1.4% vs. 0.2%), somnolence (1.3% vs. 0.2%) and headache (0.9% vs. 0.2%) for NUCYNTA- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Seventy-six percent of NUCYNTA-treated patients from the nine studies experienced adverse events.</p><p>NUCYNTA was studied in multiple-dose, active- or placebo-controlled studies, or noncontrolled studies (n = 2178), in single-dose studies (n = 870), in open-label study extension (n = 483) and in Phase 1 studies (n = 597). Of these, 2034 patients were treated with doses of 50 mg to 100 mg of NUCYNTA dosed every 4 to 6 hours.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to NUCYNTA in 3161 patients, including 449 exposed for 45 days. NUCYNTA was studied primarily in placebo- and active-controlled studies (n = 2266, and n = 2944, respectively).

An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. NUCYNTA oral solution is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including NUCYNTA oral solution, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions.

When tapentadol was administered twice daily by the subcutaneous route in rats at dose levels of 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day [producing up to 1 times the plasma exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 700 mg/day based on an area under the time-curve (AUC) comparison], no teratogenic effects were observed. Evidence of embryo fetal toxicity included transient delays in skeletal maturation (i.e. reduced ossification) at the 40 mg/kg/day dose which was associated with significant maternal toxicity.</p><p>Administration of tapentadol HCl in rabbits at doses of 4, 10, or 24 mg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection [producing 0.2, 0.6, and 1.85 times the plasma exposure at the MRHD based on an AUC comparison] revealed embryo fetal toxicity at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day. Findings included reduced fetal viability, skeletal delays and other variations. In addition, there were multiple malformations including gastroschisis/thoracogastroschisis, amelia/phocomelia, and cleft palate at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day and above, and ablepharia, encephalopathy, and spina bifida at the high dose of 24 mg/kg/day.

Physicochemical and available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data on tapentadol point to excretion in breast milk and risk to the breastfeeding child cannot be excluded. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for NUCYNTA oral solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NUCYNTA oral solution or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Infants exposed to NUCYNTA oral solution through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of NUCYNTA oral solution in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of patients in Phase 2/3 double-blind, multiple-dose clinical studies of NUCYNTA, 19% were 65 and over, while 5% were 75 and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. The rate of constipation was higher in subjects greater than or equal to 65 years than those less than 65 years (12% vs. 7%).</p><p>Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to tapentadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of NUCYNTA oral solution slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span></p><p>Tapentadol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Administration of tapentadol resulted in higher exposures and serum levels of tapentadol in subjects with impaired hepatic function compared to subjects with normal hepatic function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Use of NUCYNTA oral solution is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Score 10 to 15). The dose of NUCYNTA oral solution should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].</span>No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score 5 to 6) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.16), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use of NUCYNTA oral solution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute) is not recommended. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-90 mL/minute) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.17), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">NUCYNTA oral solution contains tapentadol, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">NUCYNTA oral solution contains tapentadol, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. NUCYNTA can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider (s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control..</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>NUCYNTA oral solution like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of NUCYNTA</span></p><p>NUCYNTA oral solution is for oral use only. Abuse of NUCYNTA oral solution poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of NUCYNTA oral solution with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.</p><p>Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), or mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine) or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>NUCYNTA oral solution should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].</span> If NUCYNTA oral solution is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including: irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdosage with NUCYNTA oral solution can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to severe hypoxia in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen, and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to tapentadol overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to tapentadol overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of tapentadol in NUCYNTA oral solution, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed in the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Nucynta Solution Description</h2><p class="First">NUCYNTA (tapentadol) oral solution is a mu-opioid receptor agonist, available in a liquid solution for oral administration. The chemical name is 3-[(1R,2R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-ethyl-2- methylpropyl]phenol monohydrochloride and it has the following chemical structure:</p><p></p><p>The molecular weight of tapentadol HCl is 257.80, and the molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">23</span>NO·HCl. The n-octanol:water partition coefficient log P value is 2.87. The pKa values are 9.34 and 10.45.</p><p>NUCYNTA (tapentadol) oral solution is supplied as a clear, colorless solution and contains 20 mg/mL of tapentadol (corresponding to 23 mg/mL of tapentadol hydrochloride). The inactive ingredients in NUCYNTA oral solution include: citric acid monohydrate, purified water, raspberry flavor, sodium hydroxide, and sucralose.</p><h2>Nucynta Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Tapentadol is a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI). Analgesia in animal models is derived from both of these properties.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS)</span><br/>
Tapentadol produces respiratory depression by direct effect on the brainstem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Tapentadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and on Other Smooth Muscle</span><br/>
Tapentadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span><br/>
There was no effect of therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of tapentadol on the QT interval. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover study, healthy subjects were administered five consecutive doses of NUCYNTA 100 mg every 6 hours, NUCYNTA 150 mg every 6 hours, placebo and a single oral dose of moxifloxacin. Similarly, NUCYNTA had no relevant effect on other ECG parameters (heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, T-wave or U-wave morphology).</p><p>Tapentadol produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span><br/>
Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span> They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span><br/>
Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration-Efficacy Relationships</span><br/>
The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of tapentadol for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration-Adverse Experience Relationships</span><br/>
There is a relationship between increasing tapentadol plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/>
The mean absolute bioavailability after single-dose administration (fasting) of NUCYNTA is approximately 32% due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Maximum serum concentrations of tapentadol are typically observed at around 1.25 hours after dosing.</p><p>Dose-proportional increases in the Cmax and AUC values of tapentadol have been observed over the 50 to 150 mg dose range.</p><p>A multiple (every 6 hour) dose study with doses ranging from 75 to 175 mg tapentadol showed a mean accumulation factor of 1.6 for the parent drug and 1.8 for the major metabolite tapentadol-O-glucuronide, which are primarily determined by the dosing interval and apparent half-life of tapentadol and its metabolite.</p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span><br/>
The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased by 25% and 16%, respectively, when NUCYNTA was administered after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. NUCYNTA may be given with or without food.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
Tapentadol is widely distributed throughout the body. Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution (Vz) for tapentadol is 540 +/- 98 L. The plasma protein binding is low and amounts to approximately 20%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span><br/>
In humans, about 97% of the parent compound is metabolized. Tapentadol is mainly metabolized via Phase 2 pathways, and only a small amount is metabolized by Phase 1 oxidative pathways. The major pathway of tapentadol metabolism is conjugation with glucuronic acid to produce glucuronides. After oral administration approximately 70% (55% O-glucuronide and 15% sulfate of tapentadol) of the dose is excreted in urine in the conjugated form. A total of 3% of drug was excreted in urine as unchanged drug. Tapentadol is additionally metabolized to N-desmethyl tapentadol (13%) by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and to hydroxy tapentadol (2%) by CYP2D6, which are further metabolized by conjugation. Therefore, drug metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 system is of less importance than phase 2 conjugation.</p><p>None of the metabolites contribute to the analgesic activity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span><br/>
Tapentadol and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively (99%) via the kidneys. The terminal half-life is on average 4 hours after oral administration. The total clearance is 1530 +/- 177 mL/min.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Age: Geriatric Population</span><br/>
The mean exposure (AUC) to tapentadol was similar in elderly subjects compared to young adults, with a 16% lower mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> observed in the elderly subject group compared to young adult subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span><br/>
Administration of NUCYNTA resulted in higher exposures and serum levels to tapentadol in subjects with impaired hepatic function compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The ratio of tapentadol pharmacokinetic parameters for the mild hepatic impairment group (Child- Pugh Score 5 to 6) and moderate hepatic impairment group (Child-Pugh Score 7 to 9) in comparison to the normal hepatic function group were 1.7 and 4.2, respectively, for AUC; 1.4 and 2.5, respectively, for C<span class="Sub">max</span>; and 1.2 and 1.4, respectively, for t<span class="Sub">1/2</span>. The rate of formation of tapentadol-O-glucuronide was lower in subjects with increased liver impairment.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span><br/>
AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of tapentadol were comparable in subjects with varying degrees of renal function (from normal to severely impaired). In contrast, increasing exposure (AUC) to tapentadol-O-glucuronide was observed with increasing degree of renal impairment. In subjects with mild (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> = 50 to &lt;80 mL/min), moderate (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> = 30 to &lt;50 mL/min), and severe (CL<span class="Sub">CR</span> = &lt;30 mL/min) renal impairment, the AUC of tapentadol-O-glucuronide was 1.5-, 2.5-, and 5.5- fold higher compared with normal renal function, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions</span><br/>
Tapentadol is mainly metabolized by Phase 2 glucuronidation, a high capacity/low affinity system; therefore, clinically relevant interactions caused by Phase 2 metabolism are unlikely to occur. Naproxen and probenecid increased the AUC of tapentadol by 17% and 57%, respectively. These changes are not considered clinically relevant and no change in dose is required.</p><p>No changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of tapentadol were observed when acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid were given concomitantly.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies did not reveal any potential of tapentadol to either inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes. Furthermore, a minor amount of NUCYNTA is metabolized via the oxidative pathway. Thus, clinically relevant interactions mediated by the cytochrome P450 system are unlikely to occur.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of tapentadol were not affected when gastric pH or gastrointestinal motility were increased by omeprazole and metoclopramide, respectively.</p><p>Plasma protein binding of tapentadol is low (approximately 20%). Therefore, the likelihood of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions by displacement from the protein binding site is low.</p><h2>NON-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span><br/>
Tapentadol was administered to rats (diet) and mice (oral gavage) for two years.</p><p>In mice, tapentadol HCl was administered by oral gavage at dosages of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day for 2 years (up to 0.2 times the plasma exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] on an area under the time-curve [AUC] basis). No increase in tumor incidence was observed at any dose level.</p><p>In rats, tapentadol HCl was administered in diet at dosages of 10, 50, 125 and 250 mg/kg/day for two years (up to 0.2 times in the male rats and 0.6 times in the female rats the MRHD on an AUC basis). No increase in tumor incidence was observed at any dose level.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span><br/>
Tapentadol did not induce gene mutations in bacteria, but was clastogenic with metabolic activation in a chromosomal aberration test in V79 cells. The test was repeated and was negative in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. The one positive result for tapentadol was not confirmed <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in rats, using the two endpoints of chromosomal aberration and unscheduled DNA synthesis, when tested up to the maximum tolerated dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span><br/>
Tapentadol HCl was administered intravenously to male or female rats at dosages of 3, 6, or 12 mg/kg/day (representing exposures of up to approximately 0.4 times the exposure at the MRHD on an AUC basis, based on extrapolation from toxicokinetic analyses in a separate 4-week intravenous study in rats). Tapentadol did not alter fertility at any dose level. Maternal toxicity and adverse effects on embryonic development, including decreased number of implantations, decreased numbers of live conceptuses, and increased pre- and post-implantation losses occurred at dosages ≥6 mg/kg/day.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">In toxicological studies with tapentadol, the most common systemic effects of tapentadol were related to the mu-opioid receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition pharmacodynamic properties of the compound. Transient, dose-dependent and predominantly CNS-related findings were observed, including impaired respiratory function and convulsions, the latter occurring in the dog at plasma levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) which are in the range associated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy and safety of NUCYNTA in the treatment of acute pain has been established in two randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled studies of moderate to severe pain from first metatarsal bunionectomy and end-stage degenerative joint disease.</p><h3>Orthopedic Surgery – Bunionectomy</h3><p class="First">A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study demonstrated the efficacy of 50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg NUCYNTA given every 4 to 6 hours for 72 hours in patients aged 18 to 80 years experiencing moderate to severe pain following unilateral, first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery. Patients who qualified for the study with a baseline pain score of ≥4 on an 11-point rating scale ranging from 0 to 10 were randomized to 1 of 5 treatments. Patients were allowed to take a second dose of study medication as soon as 1 hour after the first dose on study Day 1, with subsequent dosing every 4 to 6 hours. If rescue analgesics were required, the patients were discontinued for lack of efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing the sum of pain intensity difference over the first 48 hours (SPID48) versus placebo. NUCYNTA at each dose provided a greater reduction in pain compared to placebo based on SPID48 values.</p><p>For various degrees of improvement from baseline to the 48-hour endpoint, Figure 1 shows the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figures are cumulative, such that every patient that achieves a 50% reduction in pain from baseline is included in every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the 48-hour observation period in the study were assigned 0% improvement.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Percentage of Patients Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief as Measured by Pain Severity at 48 Hours Compared to Baseline- Post Operative Bunionectomy</span></p><p></p><p>The proportions of patients who showed reduction in pain intensity at 48 hours of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater were significantly higher in patients treated with NUCYNTA at each dose versus placebo.</p><h3>End-Stage Degenerative Joint Disease</h3><p class="First">A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 50 mg and 75 mg NUCYNTA given every 4 to 6 hours during waking hours for 10 days in patients aged 18 to 80 years, experiencing moderate to severe pain from end stage degenerative joint disease of the hip or knee, defined as a 3-day mean pain score of ≥5 on an 11-point pain intensity scale, ranging from 0 to 10. Pain scores were assessed twice daily and assessed the pain the patient had experienced over the previous 12 hours. Patients were allowed to continue non-opioid analgesic therapy for which they had been on a stable regimen before screening throughout the study. Eighty-three percent (83%) of patients in the tapentadol treatment groups and the placebo group took such analgesia during the study. The 75 mg treatment group was dosed at 50 mg for the first day of the study, followed by 75 mg for the remaining nine days. Patients requiring rescue analgesics other than study medication were discontinued for lack of efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing the sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) versus placebo over the first five days of treatment. NUCYNTA 50 mg and 75 mg provided improvement in pain compared with placebo based on the 5-Day SPID.</p><p>For various degrees of improvement from baseline to the Day 5 endpoint, Figure 2 shows the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figures are cumulative, such that every patient that achieves a 50% reduction in pain from baseline is included in every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the 5-day observation period in the study were assigned 0% improvement.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2: Percentage of Patients Achieving Various Levels of Pain Relief as Measured by Average Pain Severity for the Previous 12 hours, Measured on Study Day 5 Compared to Baseline -- End Stage Degenerative Joint Disease</span></p><p></p><p>The proportions of patients who showed reduction in pain intensity at 5 days of 30% or greater, or 50% or greater were significantly higher in patients treated with NUCYNTA<span class="Sup">®</span> at each dose versus placebo.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">NUCYNTA oral solution, 20 mg/mL, is available as a clear, colorless solution.
