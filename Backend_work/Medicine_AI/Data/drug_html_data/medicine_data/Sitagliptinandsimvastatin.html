</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Sitagliptin</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for sitagliptin and simvastatin</h2><p>Sitagliptin and simvastatin combination is used together with a proper diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. It is also used together with a proper diet to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride (fats) levels in the blood. Sitagliptin and simvastatin may help prevent medical problems caused by clogged blood vessels such as heart attacks and strokes.</p><p>Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. It helps to control blood sugar levels by increasing substances in the body that make the pancreas release more insulin. It also signals the liver to stop producing sugar (glucose) when there is too much sugar in the blood.</p><p>Simvastatin belongs to the group of medicines called statins. It works to reduce the amount of cholesterol in the blood by blocking the production of cholesterol.</p><p>Sitagliptin and simvastatin was available only with your doctor's prescription. The Juvisync™ product will no longer be marketed in the United States as of September 26, 2013, but may be available in other countries.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using sitagliptin and simvastatin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For sitagliptin and simvastatin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to sitagliptin and simvastatin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of sitagliptin and simvastatin combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sitagliptin and simvastatin combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney or muscle problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving sitagliptin and simvastatin combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using sitagliptin and simvastatin.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking sitagliptin and simvastatin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using sitagliptin and simvastatin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using sitagliptin and simvastatin while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant. If you think you have become pregnant while using the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Do not use sitagliptin and simvastatin if you are also taking any of the following medicines: boceprevir (Victrelis®), cobicistat-containing products (Stribild®), cyclosporine (Gengraf®, Neoral®, Sandimmune®), danazol (Danocrine®), gemfibrozil (Lopid®), nefazodone (Serzone®), telaprevir (Incivek®), certain antibiotics (such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, telithromycin, voriconazole, Nizoral®), or medicines to treat HIV/AIDS (such as atazanavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, Crixivan®, Kaletra®, Lexiva®, Norvir®, Prezista®, Reyataz®). <i>Using these medicines together with sitagliptin and simvastatin combination may increase your risk of muscle injury and could result in kidney problems</i>.</p><p>Chinese patients who are taking large amounts of niacin (greater than or equal to 1 gram or 1000 milligrams per day) together with sitagliptin and simvastatin may have an increased risk for muscle injury. Talk to your doctor if you are Chinese or have Chinese ancestry and take large amounts of niacin (Niacor®, Niaspan®). You may need a different dose of sitagliptin and simvastatin.</p><p>Call your doctor right away if you have unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, especially if you also have unusual tiredness or a fever. These could be symptoms of serious muscle problems, such as myopathy or immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). Myopathy is more common when high doses of simvastatin (eg, 80 milligrams) are used, but some people get myopathy with lower doses.</p><p>Call your doctor right away if you have dark-colored urine, diarrhea, a fever, muscle cramps or spasms, muscle pain or stiffness, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These could be symptoms of a serious muscle problem called rhabdomyolysis, which can cause kidney problems.</p><p>Call your doctor right away if you have dark-colored urine, a general feeling of tiredness or weakness, a headache, light-colored stools, loss of appetite, stomach pain, upper right stomach pain, vomiting, weight loss, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of liver damage.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if you have sudden and severe stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, or lightheadedness. These may be symptoms of pancreatitis (swelling and inflammation of the pancreas).</p><p>Sitagliptin and simvastatin may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, or certain skin conditions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). These reactions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, fever or chills, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using sitagliptin and simvastatin.</p><p>Sitagliptin and simvastatin may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Low blood sugar can also occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting, take certain medicines, or take sitagliptin with another type of diabetes medicine (eg, insulin, glimepiride, metformin, or pioglitazone). <i>Symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they cause you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms with low blood sugar</i>. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly.</p><p><i>Symptoms of low blood sugar</i> include anxiety, behavior changes similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, cool, pale skin, difficulty with thinking, drowsiness, excessive hunger, a fast heartbeat, headaches that continue, nausea, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level. If you have low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes, or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drinks, or sugar dissolved in water. Glucagon is a medicine that is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms, such as seizures (convulsions) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. The members of your family should also know how to use glucagon.</p><p>There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes with a list of all your medicines.</p><p>Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using sitagliptin and simvastatin. You may need to stop using sitagliptin and simvastatin if you have major surgery, a major injury, or you develop other serious health problems.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
