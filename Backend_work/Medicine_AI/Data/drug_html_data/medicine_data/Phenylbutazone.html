</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span>: Phenylbutazone 20% Injection (Phenylbutazone) is a synthetic, nonhormonal anti-inflammoatory, antipyretic compound useful in the management of inflammaotry conditions. The apparent analgesic effect is probably related mainly to the compound's anti-inflammatory properties.  Chemically, Phenylbutazone is 4-butyl-1,2-diphenyl-3,5-pyrazolidinedione. It is a pyrazolon derivative entirely unrelated to the steroid hormones, and has the following structural formula:</p><p></p><h2>BACKGROUND PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Kuzell, <span class="Sup">1, 2, 3</span> Payne,<span class="Sup">4</span> Fleming,<span class="Sup">5</span> and Denko<span class="Sup">6</span> demonstrated clinical effectiveness of Phenylbutazone in acute clinical effectiveness of Phenylbutazone in acute rheumatism, gout, gouty arthritis and various other rheumatoid disorders in man. Anti-rheumatic and anti-inflammatory activity has been well established by Fabre,<span class="Sup">7</span> Domenjoz,<span class="Sup">8</span> Wilhelmi,<span class="Sup">9</span> and Yourish.<span class="Sup">10</span>  Lieberman <span class="Sup">11</span> reported on the effective use of phnylbutazone in the treatment of painful conditions of the musculosketal system in dogs; including posterior paralysis associated with intervertebral disc syndrome, painful fractures, arthritis, and painful injuries to the limbs and joints. Joshua<span class="Sup">12</span> observed objective improvement without toxidity following long-term therapy of two aged arthritic dogs. Ogilvie and Sutter<span class="Sup">13</span> reported rapid response to Phenylbutazone therapy in a review of 19 clinical cases including posterior paralysis, posterior weakness, arthritis, rheumatism, and other conditions associated with lameness and musculoskeletal weakness.<br/></p><p>Camberos<span class="Sup">14</span> reported favorable results with Phenylbutazone following intermittent treatment of Thoroughbred horses for arthritis and chronic arthrosis (e.g., osteoarthritis of medial and distal bones of the hock, arthritis of stifle and hip, arthrosis of the spine, chronic hip pains, achronic pain in the trapezius muscles, and generalized arthritis). Results were less favorable in cases of traumatism, muscle rupture, strains and inflammations of the third phalanx. Sutter<span class="Sup">15</span> reported favorable response in chronic equine arthritis, fair results in a severely bruised mare, and poor results in two cases where the condition was limited to the third phalanx<br/></p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">    For relief of inflammatory conditions associated with the musculockeletal system in horses.<br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Treated animals should not be slaughtered for food purposes. Parenteral injections should be made intravenously only; do not inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Use with caution in patients who have a history of drug allergy.<br/></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First">Stop medication at the first sign of gastrointestinal upset, jaundice, or blood dyscrasia. Authenticated cases of agranulocytosis associated with the drug have occurred in man. To guard against this possibility, conduct routine blood counts at weekly intervals of two weeks thereafter. Any significant fall in th total white count, relative decrease in granulocytes, or black or tarry stools, should be regarded as a signal for immediate cessation of therapy and institution of appropriate counter measures. In the treatment of inflammatory conditions associated with infections, specific anti-infective therapy is required.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Store in refrigerator between 2<span class="Sup">o</span> - 8<span class="Sup">o</span>C (36<span class="Sup">o</span> - 46<span class="Sup">o</span>F)</span><br/></p><h2>Phenylbutazone Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HORSES</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">INTRAVENOUSLY</span><span class="Bold">:</span> 1 to 2 g per 1,000 lbs of body weight (5 to 10 mL/1,000 lbs) daily. Injection should be given slowly and with care. Limit intravenous administration to a maximum of 5 successive days, which may be followed by oral Phenylbutazone dosage forms.</p><p><span class="Bold">GUIDELINES TO SUCCESSFUL THERAPY</span><br/>
1.  Use a relatively high dose for the first 48 hours, then reduce gradually to a maintenance dose. Maintain lowest dose capable of producing desired clinical response.<br/>
2.  Response to Phenylbutazone therapy is prompt, usually occurring within 24 hours. If no significant clinical response is evident after 5 days, reevaluate diagnosis and therapeutic approach.<br/>
3.  In animals, Phenylbutazone is largely metabolized in 8 hours. It is recommended that a third of the daily dose be administered at 8 hour intervals. Reduce dosage as symptoms regress. In some cases, treatment may be given only when symptoms appear with no need for continuous medication. If long-term therapy is planned, oral administration is suggested.<br/>
4.  Many chronic conditions will respond to Phenylbutazone therapy, but discontinuance of treatment may result in recurrence of symptoms.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>How is Phenylbutazone Supplied</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INJECTABLE</span>: <span class="Bold">For Horses only: 100 mL vials, 200 mg/mL (1 g/5 mL)</span> Each mL contians 200 mg of Phenylbutazone, 10.45 mg of benzyl alcohol as preservative, sodium hydroxide to adjust pH to 9.5 to 10.0, and water for injection, Q.S.</p><p class="First">1.
