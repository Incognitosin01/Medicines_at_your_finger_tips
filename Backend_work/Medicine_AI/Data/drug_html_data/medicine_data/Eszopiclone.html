Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Eszopiclone may be habit-forming. <b>Misuse can cause addiction, overdose, or death.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away  eszopiclone is against the law.</p><p>Eszopiclone will make you fall asleep. Never take this medicine during your normal waking hours, unless you have at least 7 to 8 hours to dedicate to sleeping.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 7 to 10 days of treatment, or if they get worse.</p><p>Do not stop using eszopiclone suddenly after taking it over several days in a row, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.
