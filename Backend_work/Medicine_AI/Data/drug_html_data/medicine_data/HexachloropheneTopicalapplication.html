</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for hexachlorophene</h2><p>Hexachlorophene is a topical antibacterial cleanser. It is used to clean the skin before surgery to prevent the spread of infection. It works like a detergent to cleanse the skin by killing or preventing the growth of bacteria.</p><p>Hexachlorophene is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using hexachlorophene</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For hexachlorophene, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to hexachlorophene or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Because of hexachlorophene's potential for the risk of increased drug absorption, use in infants and premature babies is not recommended.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hexachlorophene in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have skin diseases, circulation problems, delayed wound healing, and age-related liver, kidney, and heart problems, which may require caution in patients receiving hexachlorophene.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of hexachlorophene. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Broken or burned skin—Should not be used in patients with this condition.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Ichthyosis congenita (genetic skin disorder) or</li>
<li>Letterer-Siwe disease (a rare disease) or</li>
<li>Other skin diseases—Use with caution. May increase the risk for serious side effects.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of hexachlorophene</h2><p><i>It is very important that you use hexachlorophene only as directed</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>Hexachlorophene should only be used on the skin. Do not swallow it or use it in the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, genital area (sex organs), or anal area. If it does get on these areas, rinse it right away with water.</p><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about how to clean and care for your skin before and after you use hexachlorophene.
