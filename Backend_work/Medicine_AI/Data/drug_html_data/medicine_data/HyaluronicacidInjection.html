It works by acting like a lubricant and shock absorber in the joints and helps the joints to work properly.</p><p>Hyaluronic acid is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using hyaluronic acid</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For hyaluronic acid, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to hyaluronic acid or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of hyaluronic acid injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of hyaluronic acid injection in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of hyaluronic acid.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of hyaluronic acid</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is given as a shot into your knee joint. It may take more than one injection for the pain to go away.</p><p>You will receive a series of shots of hyaluronic acid one week apart for a total of three or four injections.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using hyaluronic acid</h2><p><i>Your doctor will check your progress closely while you are receiving hyaluronic acid</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it.</p><p>Do not strain your knee joint for two days after receiving hyaluronic acid. Avoid activities such as jogging, soccer, tennis, heavy lifting, or standing on your feet for a long time.</p><p>Temporary pain or swelling in the knee joint may occur after receiving hyaluronic acid injection. Call your doctor if the pain or swelling in the knee persists or becomes worse after receiving hyaluronic acid.</p><p>Do not use hyaluronic acid with disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., benzalkonium chloride). This may prevent hyaluronic acid injection from working properly.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Hyaluronic acid side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
