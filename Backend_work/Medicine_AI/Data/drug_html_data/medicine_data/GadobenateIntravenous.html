Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. NSF may result in fatal or debilitating systemic fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs.The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) or acute kidney injury.Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (eg, age greater than 60 years, hypertension or diabetes), estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended gadobenate dimeglumine dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug from the body prior to re-administration</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

MRI scans are a special kind of diagnostic procedure. They use magnets and computers to create images or “pictures” of certain areas inside the body. Unlike x-rays, they do not involve ionizing radiation. Gadobenate is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA).</p><p>Gadobenate is given by injection before an MRI scan to help find problems in the brain, spine, and other parts of your body.</p><p>Gadobenate is to be used only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using gadobenate</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. Also, other things may affect test results. For this test, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to gadobenate or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadobenate injection in the pediatric population. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in preterm babies.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of gadobenate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving gadobenate.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this diagnostic test. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Anemia or any other blood disorder or</li>
<li>Asthma or allergies, history of or</li>
<li>Heart disease, history of or</li>
<li>Heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia) or</li>
<li>Kidney problems, severe (recent or long-term) or</li>
<li>Liver disease or</li>
<li>Patients who have recently received a GBCA or</li>
<li>Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May cause side effects to become worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure)—Use with caution. May increase risk for more serious side effects.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Dubin-Johnson syndrome (an inherited disorder)—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of gadobenate</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you gadobenate. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins just before you have an MRI scan.</p><p>Gadobenate comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using gadobenate</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check the progress of you or your child while you are receiving gadobenate and during the MRI scan</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have burning or itching of the skin, red or dark patches on the skin, skin swelling, hardening, or tightening, joint stiffness, limited range of motion in the arms and legs, pain that is deep in the hip bone or ribs, or muscle weakness</i>. These may be symptoms of a very serious disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).</p><p>Gadobenate may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Gadobenate is a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Gadolinium may be stored in the brain, bone, skin, and other organs of the body in patients with a normal kidney function. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have mild, burning pain, feeling of warmth or coldness, or redness or swelling at the injection site.</p><p>Gadobenate can cause changes in heart rhythm, such as a condition called QT prolongation. It may change the way your heart beats and cause fainting or serious side effects in some patients. Contact your doctor right away if you or your child have any symptoms of heart rhythm problems, such as a fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat.</p><p>Before you have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you or your child are receiving gadobenate. The results of some tests may be affected by gadobenate.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Gadobenate side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
