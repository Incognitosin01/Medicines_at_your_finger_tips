Your doctor may occasionally change your dose to make sure you get the best results. Do not take  treprostinil in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>This medicine should be used only with a Tyvaso inhalation system. The inhalation system comes with patient instructions for safe and effective use. Do not use this medicine at home if you do not fully understand how to use the inhalation system and properly clean it daily. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>Treprostinil inhalation is usually given 4 times per day at evenly spaced intervals during waking hours. Each time you use the medicine, you will inhale up to 9 breaths of the medication. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Do not mix other inhalation medicines with treprostinil in the Tyvaso inhalation system.</p><p>Wash your hands before preparing your treprostinil doses in the inhalation system.</p><p>Before your first dose of each day, twist off the top of one ampule and empty the contents into the medicine cup of the inhalation system. One ampule of treprostinil inhalation contains enough medicine for all 4 of a day's doses.</p><p>To keep the medicine in the cup from spilling, store the inhalation system upright and tightly capped with the plugs when not in use.</p><p>At the end of the day after your last dose, empty and rinse out the medicine cup, even if there is still some medicine left in it.</p><p>The effects of treprostinil inhalation will lessen over time between doses. Talk with your doctor if you need to time your dosing around any planned activities.</p><p>Do not use more than 9 breaths per treatment session, 4 times per day.</p><p>Use treprostinil regularly to get the most benefit. You should not reduce your dose or stop using treprostinil suddenly. Stopping suddenly may make your condition worse. Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely. Make sure you have a backup inhalation system available so as not to interrupt your treatment if one system stops working.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse while using treprostinil inhalation.</p><p>Store treprostinil ampules in their foil pouch at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light. Once you have opened a foil pouch, the ampules in it should be used within 7 days.</p><p>Any treprostinil placed into the medicine cup of the inhalation system must be used within 24 hours. Throw away any unused medicine at the end of the day after your last dose.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention if you think you have used too much of  treprostinil.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include warmth or tingling, vomiting, or fainting.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using treprostinil inhalation?</h2><p>Do not swallow treprostinil inhalation. The medication should be inhaled using only the Tyvaso inhalation system.</p><p>Rinse with water if this medication gets in your eyes.</p><p>If this medication gets on your skin, wash the area with soap and water.</p><p>Avoid getting up too fast from a sitting or lying position, or you may feel dizzy.
