The pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid prior to lyophilization. The contents of the vial are lyophilized and sealed under nitrogen at the time of manufacture.</p><p>The pH of the reconstituted product is 4.2 to 5.7.</p><p>The structure of mebrofenin (2,2'-[[2-[(3-Bromo-2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-amino]-2-oxoethyl]imino] bisacetic acid) is shown below:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Molecular Weight = 387.23</p><p>Molecular Weight = 387.23</p><p>When sterile, pyrogen-free sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m injection is added to the vial, the diagnostic agent Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin is formed for administration by intravenous injection.</p><p><span class="Bold">PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span></p><p>Technetium Tc 99m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half-life of 6.02 hours.<span class="Sup">1</span> The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is listed in Table 1.</p><p class="First">Principal Radiation Emission Data</p><p class="First">Radiation</p><p class="First">Mean % per Disintegration</p><p class="First">Mean Energy (keV)</p><p class="First">Gamma-2</p><p class="First">89.07</p><p class="First">140.5</p><p><span class="Sup">1</span>Kocher, David C., "Radioactive Decay Data Tables", DOE/TIC-11026, (1981) p. 108.</p><p><span class="Bold">External Radiation</span></p><p>The specific gamma ray constant for Tc 99m is 0.78 R/hour-millicurie at 1 cm.

The mean percent injected dose remaining in the blood at 10 minutes was 17%. The injected activity was cleared through the hepatobiliary system with visualization of the liver by 5 minutes and maximum liver uptake occurring at 11 minutes post-injection. Hepatic duct and gallbladder visualization occurred by 10 to 15 minutes and intestinal activity was visualized by 30 to 60 minutes in subjects with normal hepatobiliary function. The mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during the first 3 hours was 1% (0.4 to 2.0%).</p><p>Elevated serum bilirubin levels increase renal excretion of Tc 99m HIDA agents. In two studies in which Tc 99m Mebrofenin was administered to patients having mean elevated serum bilirubin levels of 9.8 mg/dL (1.7 to 46.3 mg/dL), the mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during the first 3 hours was 3% (0.2 to 11.5%). The mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during 3-24 hours was 14.9% (0.4 to 34.8%).</p><p>In jaundiced patients, the percent injected dose remaining in the blood at 10 minutes may be twice as high or more than the level in normals. Hepatobiliary transit may be delayed and visualization times increased. As a consequence, the quality of the images obtained frequently diminishes.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin</h2><p class="First">Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin is indicated as a hepatobiliary imaging agent.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to this compound.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">The theoretical possibility of allergic reactions should be considered in patients who receive multiple doses.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Contents of the reaction vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin and are not to be administered directly to the patient.</p><p>Delayed or non-visualization of the gallbladder may occur in the immediate post-prandial period or after prolonged fasting or parenteral feeding. Functional biliary obstruction may accompany chronic cholecystitis or pancreatitis. In addition, patients with hepatocellular disease may show nonvisualization or delayed visualization of the gallbladder. Delayed intestinal transit may also be noted in such patients. Juvenile hepatitis may be associated with gallbladder nonvisualization and the failure to visualize activity in the intestine. Administration of meperidine or morphine may delay intestinal transit of the imaging agent and may result in nonvisualization. Septic patients may show absent or delayed hepatobiliary clearance. Thus, a positive finding does not of itself permit a differential diagnosis of any of the above conditions and should be evaluated in the light of the total clinical picture and results of other diagnostic modalities.</p><p>The components of the kit are supplied sterile and non-pyrogenic. Aseptic procedures normally employed in making additions and withdrawals from sterile, non-pyrogenic containers should be used during the addition of the pertechnetate solution and the withdrawal of doses for patient administration.</p><p>The Technetium Tc 99m labeling reactions involved in preparing the agent depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state. Any oxidant present in the sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m supply may, thus, adversely affect the quality of the radiopharmaceutical. Hence, sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m containing oxidants should not be employed.</p><p>Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides.</p><p>As in the use of any radioactive material, care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the patient consistent with proper patient management and to ensure minimum radiation exposure to occupational workers.</p><p>Tc 99m Mebrofenin should be formulated no more than 18 hours prior to clinical use.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No long term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or whether Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin may affect fertility in males or females.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin. It is also not known whether Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin should be given to a pregnant woman only if the expected benefits to be gained clearly outweigh the potential hazards.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Technetium Tc 99m is excreted in human milk during lactation. Therefore, formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 18 have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Urticaria and rash have been rarely reported with the use of Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin since market introduction. Rare cases of chills and nausea have been reported with related compounds. Infrequently, death has been reported in association with the use of this class of agents.</p><h2>Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The suggested intravenous dose range of Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin in the average patient (70 kg) is:</p><p>The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration.</p><p>The patient should be in a fasting state, 4 hours is preferable. False positives (non-visualization) may result if the gallbladder has been emptied by ingestion of food.</p><p>An interval of at least 24 hours should be allowed before repeat examination.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p><p><span class="Bold">RADIATION DOSIMETRY</span></p><p>The estimated absorbed radiation doses<span class="Sup">1,2</span> to organs and tissues of an average subject (70 kg) from an intravenous injection of 370 MBq (10 millicuries) of Technetium TC 99M Mebrofenin are shown in Table 4.</p><p class="First">Estimated Absorbed Radiation Doses†</p><p class="First">Normal Subjects*</p><p class="First">Severely Jaundiced</p><p>Patients**</p><p class="First">Tissue</p><p class="First">mGy/</p><p>370 MBq</p><p class="First">rads/</p><p>10 mCi</p><p class="First">mGy/</p><p>370 MBq</p><p class="First">rads/</p><p>10 mCi</p><p class="First">Total Body</p><p class="First">2.0</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">1.7</p><p class="First">0.17</p><p class="First">Liver</p><p class="First">4.7</p><p class="First">0.47</p><p class="First">8.1</p><p class="First">0.81</p><p class="First">Gallbladder Wall</p><p class="First">13.7</p><p class="First">1.37</p><p class="First">12.5</p><p class="First">1.25</p><p class="First">Small Intestine</p><p class="First">29.9</p><p class="First">2.99</p><p class="First">16.0</p><p class="First">1.60</p><p class="First">Upper Large</p><p>Intestine Wall</p><p class="First">47.4</p><p class="First">4.74</p><p class="First">24.8</p><p class="First">2.48</p><p class="First">Lower Large</p><p>Intestine Wall</p><p class="First">36.4</p><p class="First">3.64</p><p class="First">19.7</p><p class="First">1.97</p><p class="First">Kidney</p><p class="First">2.2</p><p class="First">0.22</p><p class="First">1.9</p><p class="First">0.19</p><p class="First">Urinary Bladder Wall</p><p class="First">2.9</p><p class="First">0.29</p><p class="First">24.2</p><p class="First">2.42</p><p class="First">Ovaries</p><p class="First">10.1</p><p class="First">1.01</p><p class="First">6.4</p><p class="First">0.64</p><p class="First">Testes</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.05</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">0.11</p><p class="First">Red Marrow</p><p class="First">3.4</p><p class="First">0.34</p><p class="First">2.5</p><p class="First">0.25</p><p>†Method of Calculation:</p><p>(1) Loberg, M.D., Buddemeyer, E.V.: Application of pharmacokinetic modeling to the radiation dosimetry of hepatobiliary agents.
