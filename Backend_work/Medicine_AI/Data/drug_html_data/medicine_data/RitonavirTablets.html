</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Co-administration of ritonavir</span> <span class="Bold">with several classes of drugs including sedative hypnotics, antiarrhythmics, or ergot alkaloid preparations may result in potentially serious and/or life-threatening adverse events due to possible effects of ritonavir on the hepatic metabolism of certain drugs. Review medications taken by patients prior to prescribing ritonavir or when prescribing other medications to patients already taking ritonavir <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ritonavir Tablets</h2><p class="First">Ritonavir Tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.</p><h2>Ritonavir Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Administration Recommendations</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ritonavir Tablets must be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents.</li>
<li>Ritonavir Tablets are administered orally. Ritonavir Tablets should be swallowed whole, and not chewed, broken or crushed. Take Ritonavir Tablets with meals.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General Dosing Guidelines</span></p><p>Patients who take the 600 mg twice daily soft gel capsule ritonavir dose may experience more gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea when switching from the soft gel capsule to the tablet formulation because of greater maximum plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) achieved with the tablet formulation relative to the soft gel capsule <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Patients should also be aware that these adverse events (gastrointestinal or paresthesias) may diminish as therapy is continued.</p><h3>Dosage Recommendations in Adults</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Recommended Dosage for Treatment of HIV-1:</span></p><p>The recommended dosage of Ritonavir Tablets are 600 mg twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals. Use of a dose titration schedule may help to reduce treatment-emergent adverse events while maintaining appropriate ritonavir plasma levels. Ritonavir Tablets should be started at no less than 300 mg twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 100 mg twice daily. The maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily should not be exceeded upon completion of the titration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnant Women</span></p><p>Ritonavir oral solution is not recommended during pregnancy due to its alcohol content. Ritonavir oral solution contains the excipients alcohol and propylene glycol <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Recommendations in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Ritonavir Tablets must be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. The recommended dosage of Ritonavir Tablets in pediatric patients older than 1 month is 350 mg to 400 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily. Ritonavir Tablets should be started at 250 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily. If patients do not tolerate 400 mg per m<span class="Sup">2</span> twice daily due to adverse events, the highest tolerated dose may be used for maintenance therapy in combination with other antiretroviral agents, however, alternative therapy should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Dosage Guidelines for Oral Solution</span></p><p>Ritonavir oral solution should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age (first day of the mother’s last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth) of 44 weeks has been attained <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>Ritonavir oral solution contains alcohol and propylene glycol. Special attention should be given to accurate calculation of the dose of ritonavir oral solution, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors, and overdose. This is especially important for young children. Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to pediatric patients 1 to 6 months of age should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)]</span>.

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Initiation of ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.</li>
<li>Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of ritonavir.</li>
<li>Loss of therapeutic effect of ritonavir and possible development of resistance.</li>
</ul><p>When co-administering ritonavir with other protease inhibitors, see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important Warnings and Precautions.</p><p>See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during ritonavir therapy; review concomitant medications during ritonavir therapy, and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4) </span>and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Toxicity in Preterm Neonates</h3><p class="First">Ritonavir oral solution contains the excipients alcohol and propylene glycol. When administered concomitantly with propylene glycol, ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations. Preterm neonates may be at an increased risk of propylene glycol-associated adverse events due to diminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol, thereby leading to accumulation and potential adverse events. Postmarketing life-threatening cases of cardiac toxicity (including complete AV block, bradycardia, and cardiomyopathy), lactic acidosis, acute renal failure, CNS depression and respiratory complications leading to death have been reported, predominantly in preterm neonates receiving lopinavir/ritonavir oral solution which also contains the excipients ethanol and propylene glycol.</p><p>Ritonavir oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities. However, if the benefit of using ritonavir oral solution to treat HIV infection in infants immediately after birth outweighs the potential risks, infants should be monitored closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine, and for toxicity related to ritonavir oral solution including: hyperosmolality, with or without lactic acidosis, renal toxicity, CNS depression (including stupor, coma, and apnea), seizures, hypotonia, cardiac arrhythmias and ECG changes, and hemolysis. Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to infants should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Hepatic transaminase elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Table 3). There may be an increased risk for transaminase elevations in patients with underlying hepatitis B or C. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering ritonavir to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in these patients, especially during the first three months of ritonavir treatment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction, including some fatalities. These have generally occurred in patients taking multiple concomitant medications and/or with advanced AIDS.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy, including those who developed hypertriglyceridemia. In some cases fatalities have been observed. Patients with advanced HIV disease may be at increased risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>. Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) or abnormalities in laboratory values (such as increased serum lipase or amylase values) suggestive of pancreatitis should occur. Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and ritonavir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made.</p><h3>Allergic Reactions/Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Allergic reactions including urticaria, mild skin eruptions, bronchospasm, and angioedema have been reported. Cases of anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reactions develop.</p><h3>PR Interval Prolongation</h3><p class="First">Ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in some patients. Post marketing cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported in patients.</p><p>Ritonavir should be used with caution in patients with underlying structural heart disease, preexisting conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, as these patients may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities.</p><p>The impact on the PR interval of co-administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval (including calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, digoxin and atazanavir) has not been evaluated. As a result, co-administration of ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution, particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A. Clinical monitoring is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)</span> and<span class="Italics"> Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Lipid Disorders</h3><p class="First">Treatment with ritonavir therapy alone or in combination with saquinavir has resulted in substantial increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating ritonavir therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate, taking into account any potential drug-drug interactions with ritonavir and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia</h3><p class="First">New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established. Consider monitoring for hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes mellitus, or an exacerbation of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with ritonavir.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including ritonavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci</span> pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Fat Redistribution</h3><p class="First">Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.</p><h3>Patients with Hemophilia</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis, in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established.</p><h3>Resistance/Cross-resistance</h3><p class="First">Varying degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed. Continued administration of ritonavir 600 mg twice daily following loss of viral suppression may increase the likelihood of cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Ritonavir has been shown to increase triglycerides, cholesterol, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), GGT, CPK, and uric acid. Appropriate laboratory testing should be performed prior to initiating ritonavir therapy and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms occur during therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling.</p><ul class="Disc">

Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC (greater than 3-fold) when co-administered with ritonavir. Thus, co-administration of ritonavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 4.</p><p>Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 to a lesser extent. Co-administration of substrates of CYP2D6 with ritonavir could result in increases (up to 2-fold) in the AUC of the other agent, possibly requiring a proportional dosage reduction. Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 as well as other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase.</p><p>These examples are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with ritonavir. The healthcare provider should consult appropriate references for comprehensive information.</p><h3>Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Table 4 provides a list of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions.

Ingestion of the product over the recommended dose by a young child could result in significant toxicity and could potentially be lethal.</p><p>Treatment of overdose with ritonavir consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose with ritonavir. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed drug. Since ritonavir is extensively metabolized by the liver and is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the drug. However, dialysis can remove both ethanol and propylene glycol in the case of overdose with ritonavir oral solution.

Inhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor which leads to production of non-infectious immature HIV particles.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture</span></p><p>The activity of ritonavir was assessed in acutely infected lymphoblastoid cell lines and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The concentration of drug that inhibits 50% (EC<span class="Sub">50</span>) value of viral replication ranged from 3.8 to 153 nM depending upon the HIV-1 isolate and the cells employed. The average EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value for low passage clinical isolates was 22 nM (n = 13). In MT<span class="Sub">4</span> cells, ritonavir demonstrated additive effects against HIV-1 in combination with either didanosine (ddI) or zidovudine (ZDV). Studies which measured cytotoxicity of ritonavir on several cell lines showed that greater than 20 microM was required to inhibit cellular growth by 50% resulting in a cell culture therapeutic index of at least 1000.</p><p><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to ritonavir have been selected in cell culture. Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed mutations in the HIV-1 protease gene leading to amino acid substitutions I84V, V82F, A71V, and M46I. Phenotypic (n = 18) and genotypic (n = 48) changes in HIV-1 isolates from selected patients treated with ritonavir were monitored in phase I/II trials over a period of 3 to 32 weeks. Substitutions associated with the HIV–1 viral protease in isolates obtained from 43 patients appeared to occur in a stepwise and ordered fashion at positions V82A/F/T/S, I54V, A71V/T, and I36L, followed by combinations of substitutions at an additional 5 specific amino acid positions (M46I/L, K20R, I84V, L33F and L90M). Of 18 patients for whom both phenotypic and genotypic analysis were performed on free virus isolated from plasma, 12 showed reduced susceptibility to ritonavir in cell culture. All 18 patients possessed one or more substitutions in the viral protease gene. The V82A/F substitution appeared to be necessary but not sufficient to confer phenotypic resistance. Phenotypic resistance was defined as a greater than or equal to 5-fold decrease in viral sensitivity in cell culture from baseline.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cross-Resistance to Other Antiretrovirals</span></p><p>Among protease inhibitors variable cross-resistance has been recognized. Serial HIV-1 isolates obtained from six patients during ritonavir therapy showed a decrease in ritonavir susceptibility in cell culture but did not demonstrate a concordant decrease in susceptibility to saquinavir in cell culture when compared to matched baseline isolates. However, isolates from two of these patients demonstrated decreased susceptibility to indinavir in cell culture (8-fold). Isolates from 5 patients were also tested for cross-resistance to amprenavir and nelfinavir; isolates from 3 patients had a decrease in susceptibility to nelfinavir (6- to 14-fold), and none to amprenavir. Cross-resistance between ritonavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors is unlikely because of the different enzyme targets involved. One ZDV-resistant HIV-1 isolate tested in cell culture retained full susceptibility to ritonavir.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been carried out on ritonavir. In male mice, at levels of 50, 100 or 200 mg per kg per day, there was a dose dependent increase in the incidence of both adenomas and combined adenomas and carcinomas in the liver. Based on AUC measurements, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 0.3-fold for males that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose (600 mg twice-daily). There were no carcinogenic effects seen in females at the dosages tested. The exposure at the high dose was approximately 0.6-fold for the females that of the exposure in humans. In rats dosed at levels of 7, 15 or 30 mg per kg per day there were no carcinogenic effects. In this study, the exposure at the high dose was approximately 6% that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose. Based on the exposures achieved in the animal studies, the significance of the observed effects is not known.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>However, ritonavir was found to be negative for mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using <span class="Italics">S. typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">E. coli</span>, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Ritonavir produced no effects on fertility in rats at drug exposures approximately 40% (male) and 60% (female) of that achieved with the proposed therapeutic dose. Higher dosages were not feasible due to hepatic toxicity.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The activity of ritonavir as monotherapy or in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been evaluated in 1446 patients enrolled in two double-blind, randomized trials.</p><h3>Advanced Patients with Prior Antiretroviral Therapy</h3><p class="First">Study 247 was a randomized, double-blind trial (with open-label follow-up) conducted in HIV-infected patients with at least nine months of prior antiretroviral therapy and baseline CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts less than or equal to 100 cells per μL. Ritonavir 600 mg twice-daily or placebo was added to each patient's baseline antiretroviral therapy regimen, which could have consisted of up to two approved antiretroviral agents. The study accrued 1,090 patients, with mean baseline CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell count at study entry of 32 cells per μL. After the clinical benefit of ritonavir therapy was demonstrated, all patients were eligible to switch to open-label ritonavir for the duration of the follow-up period. Median duration of double-blind therapy with ritonavir and placebo was 6 months. The median duration of follow-up through the end of the open-label phase was 13.5 months for patients randomized to ritonavir and 14 months for patients randomized to placebo.</p><p>The cumulative incidence of clinical disease progression or death during the double-blind phase of Study 247 was 26% for patients initially randomized to ritonavir compared to 42% for patients initially randomized to placebo. This difference in rates was statistically significant.</p><p>Cumulative mortality through the end of the open-label follow-up phase for patients enrolled in Study 247 was 18% (99/543) for patients initially randomized to ritonavir compared to 26% (142/547) for patients initially randomized to placebo. This difference in rates was statistically significant. However, since the analysis at the end of the open-label phase includes patients in the placebo arm who were switched from placebo to ritonavir therapy, the survival benefit of ritonavir cannot be precisely estimated.</p><p>During the double-blind phase of Study 247, CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts increases from baseline for patients randomized to ritonavir at Week 2 and Week 4 were observed. From Week 4 and through Week 24, mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts for patients randomized to ritonavir appeared to plateau. In contrast, there was no apparent change in mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts for patients randomized to placebo at any visit between baseline and Week 24 of the double-blind phase of Study 247.</p><h3>Patients without Prior Antiretroviral Therapy</h3><p class="First">In Study 245, 356 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients (mean baseline CD<span class="Sub">4</span> = 364 cells per μL) were randomized to receive either ritonavir 600 mg twice-daily, zidovudine 200 mg three-times-daily, or a combination of these drugs.</p><p>During the double-blind phase of study 245, greater mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell count increases were observed from baseline to Week 12 in the ritonavir-containing arms compared to the zidovudine arms. Mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell count changes subsequently appeared to plateau through Week 24 in the ritonavir arm, whereas mean CD<span class="Sub">4</span> cell counts gradually diminished through Week 24 in the zidovudine and ritonavir plus zidovudine arms.</p><p>Greater mean reductions in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were observed from baseline to Week 2 for the ritonavir-containing arms compared to the zidovudine arm. After Week 2 and through Week 24, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA levels either remained stable in the ritonavir and zidovudine arms or gradually rebounded toward baseline in the ritonavir plus zidovudine arm.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ritonavir Tablets USP, 100 mg</span></p><p>Ritonavir Tablets USP, <span class="Bold">100 mg</span> are supplied as white to off-white, oval, film-coated, unscored tablets debossed with "AN61" on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>They are available as follows:</p><p>Bottles of 60:              NDC 65162-061-06<br/>
