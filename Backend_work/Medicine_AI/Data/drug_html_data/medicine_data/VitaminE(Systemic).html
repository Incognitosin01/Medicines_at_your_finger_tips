Management: Administer oral fat soluble vitamins at least 2 hours before or after the administration of orlistat.  Similar precautions do not apply to parenterally administered fat soluble vitamins.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Selumetinib: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vitamin E (Systemic). Management: If selumetinib is combined with additional vitamin E supplements, ensure that the total daily intake of vitamin E (including the amount of vitamin E in selumetinib and the supplement) does not exceed the recommended or safe limits.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Tipranavir: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vitamin E (Systemic). Management: Patients taking tipranavir oral solution are advised to avoid taking additional vitamin E, beyond the amounts contained in a multivitamin product.  This interaction does not apply to tipranavir capsules.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>There are no adverse reactions listed in the manufacturer’s labeling.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Vitamin K deficiency: May induce vitamin K deficiency (Corkins 2010).</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Low birth weight infants: Necrotizing enterocolitis has been associated with oral administration of large dosages (eg, &gt;200 units/day) of a hyperosmolar vitamin E preparation in low birth weight infants.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens).  Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Plasma tocopherol concentrations</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Vitamin E crosses the placenta. Maternal serum concentrations of α tocopherol increase with lipid concentrations as pregnancy progresses; however, placental transfer remains constant. Additional supplementation is not needed in pregnant women without deficiency (IOM 2000).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• Vitamins are needed for growth and good health.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
