This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For sodium thiosulfate, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to sodium thiosulfate or any other medicines.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of sodium thiosulfate in children with use in other age groups, sodium thiosulfate is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing the use of sodium thiosulfate in the elderly with use in other age groups, sodium thiosulfate is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of sodium thiosulfate.
