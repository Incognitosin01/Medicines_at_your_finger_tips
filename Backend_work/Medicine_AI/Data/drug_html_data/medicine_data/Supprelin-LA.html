Histrelin overstimulates the body's own production of certain hormones, which causes that production to shut down temporarily.</p><p>Supprelin LA implants are used to treat precocious puberty in both male and female children who are at least 2 years old.</p><p>Supprelin LA may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Supprelin LA can harm an unborn baby or cause a miscarriage. <b>Do not use if you are pregnant.</b></p><p>Supprelin LA can cause side effects such as crying spells, anger, aggression, and feeling restless or irritable. Call your doctor if you have any new or worsening mental problems.</p><p>Before you receive Supprelin LA, tell your doctor if you have painful or difficult urination, diabetes, heart disease, coronary artery disease, liver disease, a history of heart attack or stroke, osteoporosis, or a condition affecting your spine.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have a serious side effect such as severe numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, muscle weakness, problems with balance or coordination, loss of bladder or bowel control, urinating more or less than usual, sudden numbness or severe headache, problems with speech or vision, increased thirst or urination, excessive hunger, or chest pain spreading to the arm or shoulder.</p><p>A Supprelin LA implant is usually left in place for 12 months and then removed. Your doctor will determine at that time whether you need to receive another implant for treatment of your symptoms.</p><h2>Before I receive this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with Supprelin LA if you are allergic to histrelin or to similar hormone medications such as leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard, Viadur), nafarelin (Synarel), or ganirelix (Antagon).</p><p><b>Do not use Supprelin LA if you are pregnant.</b> It could harm the unborn baby or cause a miscarriage. Use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy and tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.</p><p>To make sure Supprelin LA is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

<li>

</ul><p>mental illness or psychosis;</p><p>epilepsy or other seizure disorder;</p><p>a tumor or blood vessel disorder in your brain; or</p><p>if you take a medicine that can cause seizures (such as an antidepressant).</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using histrelin. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p><b>Supprelin LA</b> should not be used in a child younger than 2 years old.</p><h2>How is Supprelin LA given?</h2><p>Supprelin LA is given in a tiny implant inserted under the skin on the inside of your upper arm. You will receive this implant with a minor surgical procedure in a clinic or doctor's office.</p><p>It is best to place the implant into your non-dominant arm (your left arm if you are right-handed). Be sure to tell your doctor which arm you use most often.</p><p>While lying on your back, your arm will be positioned with your elbow bent and held still while the implant is inserted. The skin of your upper arm will be treated with a numbing medicine to keep you from feeling pain during the insertion. Once your arm is numb, your doctor will use a scalpel to cut a small incision where the implant will be inserted.</p><p>The Supprelin LA implant is inserted using a special tool that pushes the implant into place through the incision in your skin. After injecting the implant and removing the insertion tool, your doctor will then feel your arm to make sure the implant has been correctly placed.</p><p>The incision in your skin may be closed with stitches or surgical strips. Follow your doctor's instructions about caring for the incision and keeping it bandaged and clean until it heals completely. Keep your arm dry for at least 24 hours.</p><p>You will most likely be able to feel the implant through your skin, but it should not cause pain or discomfort.</p><p>Call your doctor if you have any pain, swelling, tenderness, itching, tingling, bruising, or redness where the implant was inserted, or if the implant comes through the skin or falls out.</p><p>A Supprelin LA implant is usually left in place for 12 months and then must be removed through a surgical incision. Do not try to remove the implant yourself. Your doctor will determine whether you need another implant for continued treatment.</p><p>You may have a temporary increase in precocious puberty symptoms for a week or so after you have received the Supprelin LA implant.</p><p>To be sure this medicine is helping your condition, you may need frequent blood tests. Your blood work will help your doctor determine how long to treat you with Supprelin LA.</p><p>Histrelin can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using Supprelin LA.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Pediatric Dose for Precocious Puberty:</b></p><p>One 50 mg implant inserted subcutaneously in the inner aspect of the upper arm<br/>
