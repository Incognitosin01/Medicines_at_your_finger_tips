It works by blocking nerve signals in your body.</p><p>Lidoderm is used to relieve post-shingles pain. Apply Lidoderm only to intact skin with no blisters.</p><p>Lidocaine topical in other formulations is used to reduce pain or discomfort caused by skin irritations such as sunburn, insect bites, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and minor cuts, scratches, hemorrhoids, and burns. Lidocaine topical can also be used to treat sores inside the mouth, during dental procedures to numb the gums, and to numb the skin for a medical procedure (such as getting stiches).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>An overdose of Lidoderm can cause fatal side effects if too much lidocaine is absorbed through your skin and into your blood. This is more likely to occur when using a numbing medicine without the advice of a medical doctor (such as during a cosmetic procedure like laser hair removal). Overdose symptoms may include uneven heartbeats, seizure (convulsions), coma, slowed breathing, or respiratory failure (breathing stops). Your body may absorb more lidocaine if you use too much, if you apply it over large skin areas, or if you apply heat, bandages, or plastic wrap to treated skin areas. Skin that is cut or irritated may also absorb more topical medication than healthy skin.</p><p>Use the smallest amount of Lidoderm needed to numb the skin or relieve pain. Do not use large amounts of Lidoderm, or cover treated skin areas with a bandage or plastic wrap without medical advice. Be aware that many cosmetic procedures are performed without a medical doctor present.</p><h2>Before using Lidoderm</h2><p>An overdose of numbing medications can cause fatal side effects if too much of the medicine is absorbed through your skin and into your blood.</p><p>Overdose is more likely to occur when using a numbing medicine without the advice of a medical doctor (such as during a cosmetic procedure like laser hair removal). Symptoms may include uneven heartbeats, seizure (convulsions), coma, slowed breathing, or respiratory failure (breathing stops).</p><p>Do not use Lidoderm if you are allergic to any other type of numbing medicine.</p><p>Before using Lidoderm, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any drugs, or if you have liver disease, or broken, swollen, or damaged skin. You may not be able to use Lidoderm, or you may need dosage adjustments or special tests during treatment.</p><p>FDA pregnancy category B. Lidoderm is not expected to be harmful to an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment. Lidocaine can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby.

Do not use the medication in larger amounts, or use it for longer than recommended.</p><p>Your body may absorb more lidocaine if you use too much, if you apply it over large skin areas, or if you apply heat, bandages, or plastic wrap to treated skin areas.

If you are using the medication regularly, use the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and use the medicine at your next regularly scheduled time. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention if you think you have used too much of this medicine.
