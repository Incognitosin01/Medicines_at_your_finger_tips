Some people lack this enzyme because of a genetic disorder. Vvelaglucerase alfa is used as an enzyme replacement in people with Type I Gaucher disease.</p><p>Gaucher disease is a genetic condition in which the body lacks the enzyme needed to break down certain fatty materials (lipids). Lipids can build up in the body, causing symptoms such as easy bruising or bleeding, weakness, anemia, bone or joint pain, enlarged liver or spleen, or weakened bones that are easily fractured.</p><p>VPRIV may improve the condition of the liver, spleen, bones, and blood cells in people with Type I Gaucher disease, however, VPRIV is not a cure for this condition.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Some people receiving a VPRIV injection have had a reaction to the infusion (when the medicine is injected into the vein). Most infusion reactions have been mild. However, tell your caregiver right away if you experionce any of the following symptoms; headache, dizziness, fever, nausea, feeling weak or tired, and feeling like you might pass out. VPRIV is not a cure for Gaucher disease.</p><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.

However, having untreated Type I Gaucher disease during pregnancy may cause complications such as miscarriage or stillbirth. Type I Gaucher disease also can get worse during pregnancy and may cause medical problems in both mother and baby. The benefit of treating this disease with velaglucerase alfa may outweigh any risks to the baby</p><p>VPRIV is not approved for use by anyone younger than 4 years old.</p><h2>How is VPRIV given?</h2><p>VPRIV is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>VPRIV is usually given every other week.
