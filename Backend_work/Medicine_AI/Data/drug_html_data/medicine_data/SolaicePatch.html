The size of the patch is approximately 3.3in x 4.9in.</p><p>Menthol is chemically designated as 2-Isopropyl-5- methylcyclohexanol. It is colorless, hexagonal crystals, usually needle-like; fused masses or crystalline powder with a pleasant, peppermint-like odor. If has a melting point between 31°C to 36° C.</p><p></p><p>Capsaicin is chemically designated as (6E)-N-(4-Hydroxy-3- methoxybenzyl)-8-methyl-6-nonenamide. It is a crystalline white powder. It has a melting point of 65° C.</p><p></p><p>Each adhesive patch contains 750 mg of menthol and 7.5mg of capsaicin. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: aqua (Deionized Water), aloe barbadensis (Aloe Vera Gel) diazolidinyl urea, glycerin, Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, methyl paraben, polysorbate-80, propyl paraben, sodium polyacrylate, tetrasodium EDTA.</p><p><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span></p><p>Menthol works by targeting the k-opiod receptor on the TRPM8 neuron. The TRPM8 neuron is normallyactivated at temperatures between (8° - 28° C). Menthol causes the neuron to fire at temperatures above normal activation which triggers the characteristic cooling sensation. Also because of menthol's specific targeting of the k-opiod receptor, it is endowed with analgesic properties. Capsaicin is a naturally occurring compound. It is found in chili peppers and is what gives is "heat". Capsaicin has been found to be effective in reducing inflammation and pain. When capsaicin enters the body it binds with the protein TRPV1 which is located on pain and heat neurons. When the TRPV1 proton is activated (between 37° - 45° C) it opens the calcium ion channel and give the sensation of pain and heat. When capsaicin binds to the TRPV1 proton it forces the ion channel to open below its normal activation temperature which is why it gives the distinct heating sensation. It is thought that prolonged activation of these neurons by capsaicin depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter for pain and heat. the end result appears that the nerves are overwhelmed by the influx and unable to report pain for an extended period of time.</p><p><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span></p><p>Solaice is indicated for the temporary relief of minor aches and muscle pains associated with arthritis, simple backache, strains, muscles soreness and stiffness.</p><p><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p>Solaice is contraindicated in patients with a known history of sensitivity to any component of the product, including dietary intolerance of foods containing capsaicin.</p><p><span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">External Use Only</span></span><br/>
Solaice is intended only for topical application. Solaice may be harmful if chewed, swallowed, or otherwise ingested, or if used other than as directed. If you have taken Solaice by mouth contact 1 -800-222-1222 (the American Association of Poison Control Centers), your local poison control center, or emergency room immediately.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Eye, Mucous Membrane, and Sensitive Skin Exposure</span></span><br/>
Solaice should not come into direct or indirect contact with eyes, mucous membranes, genitals, or other sensitive areas. If eyes or mucous membranes comes into direct or indirect contact with Solaice, flush with cool water. If skin not intended to be treated comes into direct or indirect contact with Solaice, wash the affected area with soap and cool water. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS – <span class="Italics">Allergic Reaction</span></span>)</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Heat-Induced Chemical Burns</span></span><br/>
Areas treated with Solaice should not be exposed to heat or direct sunlight due to findings in studies of other products containing menthol and capsaicin (similar to Solaice) indicating the potential for serious skin injuries ranging from first- to third-degree chemical burns. Solaice should not be used for 1 hour before or after bathing, showering, swimming, sunbathing, using a hot tub, steam bath, sauna, or heating pad, or other heat or sunlight exposure to the treated area. Stop using Solaice and seek immediate medical attention if serious skin injury occurs from using Solaice in combination with heat.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Aerosolization of Capsaicin and Menthol</span></span><br/>
Aerosolization of capsaicin and menthol can occur on rapid removal of Solaice Patches, particularly in patients and bystanders with a previously unknown sensitivity to these ingredients, possibly resulting in airway irritation (usually coughing and/or sneezing), or other reaction. If irritation of eyes, mucous membranes, or airways occurs without physical contact with Solaice immediately remove the affected individual from the vicinity of Solaice, and flush eyes and mucous membranes with cool water. Seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or persist. (See also <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS – <span class="Italics">Allergic Reaction</span></span>)</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Accidental Exposure in Children</span></span><br/>
The potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used Solaice Patch, although the risk with this formulation has not been quantified. It is important for patients to store and dispose of Solaice out of the reach of children, pets and others. (See <span class="Bold">HANDLING AND DISPOSAL</span>)</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Excessive Dosing</span></span><br/>
Excessive dosing by applying Solaice to larger than recommended areas, or for longer than the recommended time, could result in increased absorption and higher blood concentrations. Longer duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller patients (especially children), or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration.</p><p><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">General</span></span><br/>
