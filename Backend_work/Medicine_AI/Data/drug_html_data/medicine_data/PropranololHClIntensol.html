High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure may reduce the risk of stroke and heart attacks.</p><p>Propranolol is also used to treat severe chest pain (angina), migraine headaches, or hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (thickened heart muscle).</p><p>This medicine may also be used to treat irregular heartbeats, tremors, or pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland tumor). It may also be used to reduce the risk of death in patients who have heart attacks.</p><p>Propranolol <i>oral solution</i> is used to treat proliferating infantile hemangioma.</p><p>This medicine is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Propranolol HCl Intensol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of propranolol <i>capsules, extended-release capsules, and tablets</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol <i>oral solution</i> in children.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol <i>oral solution</i> to treat proliferating infantile hemangioma in children 5 weeks to 5 months of age. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children older than 1 year of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of propranolol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving propranolol.</p><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>propranolol oral solution</i> in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
