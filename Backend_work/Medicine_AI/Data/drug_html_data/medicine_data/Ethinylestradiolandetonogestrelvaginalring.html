Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p><b>The vaginal ring will not prevent pregnancy if you wear it only during intercourse.</b> You must wear the ring around-the-clock for 3 full weeks (21 days). <b>Do not wear more than one ring at a time.</b></p><p>For 7 days after inserting your first vaginal ring, you may need to use back-up birth control (condoms or spermicide, but not a diaphragm or female condom).</p><p>After 21 days, remove the ring and wait 7 full days before inserting a new ring. Avoid leaving the ring in place for longer than 3 weeks. <b>Call your doctor if you get off schedule, or if you have trouble removing a vaginal ring.</b></p><p>You may have breakthrough bleeding. Tell your doctor if this bleeding continues or is very heavy.</p><p><b>If you need major surgery or will be on long-term bed rest,</b> you may need to stop using this medicine for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you are using the vaginal ring.</p><p>Store unused vaginal rings at room temperature for up to 4 months. Protect from heat and light. Dispose of a used vaginal ring in the foil pouch it came in and throw it away where children and pets cannot get to it. Do not flush the ring down a toilet.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If a ring falls out, rinse it with warm water and reinsert it. If the ring is lost or broken, insert a new ring and stay on the same schedule you started. Carefully follow the Patient Instructions about how to replace a ring that has been out of the vagina for more than 3 hours.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel is not expected to be dangerous, but may cause nausea or vaginal bleeding. A broken vaginal ring will not cause an overdose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel?</h2><p><b>Do not smoke while using the vaginal ring,</b> especially if you are older than 35 years of age.</p><p>Grapefruit may interact with ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel and lead to unwanted side effects.
