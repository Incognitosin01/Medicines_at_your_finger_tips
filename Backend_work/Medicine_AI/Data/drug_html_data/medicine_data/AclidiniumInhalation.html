</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Bronchodilator</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Aclidinium</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for aclidinium</h2><p>Aclidinium is used as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease that also includes chronic bronchitis (swelling of the tubes leading to the lungs) or emphysema (damage to the air sacs in the lungs). Aclidinium will not relieve a COPD attack that has already started.</p><p>Aclidinium belongs to the family of medicines known as bronchodilators. These are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to help open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>Aclidinium is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using aclidinium</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For aclidinium, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to aclidinium or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of inhaled aclidinium in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of inhaled aclidinium in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of aclidinium than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking aclidinium, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using aclidinium with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Amifampridine</li>
<li>Bupropion</li>
<li>Clozapine</li>
<li>Donepezil</li>
<li>Glycopyrrolate</li>
<li>Glycopyrronium Tosylate</li>

<li>Quetiapine</li>
<li>Revefenacin</li>
<li>Scopolamine</li>
<li>Secretin Human</li>
<li>Tiotropium</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of aclidinium. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Allergy to atropine, or history of or</li>
<li>Enlarged prostate or</li>
<li>Glaucoma, narrow angle or</li>
<li>Problems passing urine or</li>
<li>Urinary bladder blockage—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Allergy to milk proteins, or history of or</li>
<li>Bronchospasm (difficulty with breathing), acute—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.</li>
</ul><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of aclidinium</h2><p>Inhaled aclidinium is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is not used to relieve a COPD attack that has already started. For relief of an COPD attack that has already started, you should use another medicine. If you do not have another medicine to use for an attack or if you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p><i>Use aclidinium only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop using aclidinium without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>Aclidinium is used with a special inhaler that comes with a patient information leaflet and patient instructions. Read the directions carefully before using the medicine. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor to show you what to do. Also, ask your doctor to check regularly how you use the inhaler to make sure you are using it properly.</p><p>Use aclidinium at the same time each day.</p><p>Do not stop using aclidinium or other breathing medicines that your doctor has prescribed for you unless you have discussed this with your doctor.</p><p>To use the inhaler:</p><ul>
<li>Aclidinium comes in a sealed pouch. Do not open the pouch until you are ready to use it. Do not press the green button until you are ready to take a dose.</li>
<li>Remove the cap by squeezing and pulling it off the mouthpiece. Check the mouthpiece to make sure it is clear.</li>
<li>Hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece facing you and the green button is on top. Press the green button all the way down and release it. Do not tilt the inhaler.</li>
<li>Check the control window to make sure your dose is ready for inhalation. Look if the colored control window changed from red to green. If it is still red, repeat the steps to prepare your dose.</li>
<li>To inhale aclidinium, breathe out fully and try to get as much air out of your lungs as possible. Put your lips tightly around the mouthpiece and breathe in quickly and deeply until you hear a "click" sound. Keep breathing in, even after you hear the "click" sound to be sure you get the full dose.</li>
<li>Do not hold the green button while you are breathing in.</li>
<li>Remove the inhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for as long as is comfortable, and then breathe out slowly through your nose. You may have a grainy feeling or a slightly sweet or bitter taste in your mouth after inhalation. Do not take an extra dose if you do not taste or feel anything after inhaling.</li>
<li>Check the colored control window if it has turned to red. This means you have inhaled the full dose of aclidinium.</li>
<li>If the control window is still colored green, repeat the steps above. If you are unable to inhale correctly after several attempts, call your doctor.</li>
<li>Once the window has turned red, place the cap back by pressing it back into the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>If you want to clean the inhaler, wipe the mouthpiece with a dry tissue or towel. Do not use water to clean the inhaler, as this may damage the medicine.</li>
<li>The inhaler has a window that shows the number of doses that are left. This tells you when you are getting low on medicine. A red band will appear in the window to remind you to refill your prescription.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of aclidinium will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of aclidinium. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Paradoxical bronchospasm may be life-threatening. <i>Check with your doctor right away if you have coughing, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, or wheezing after using aclidinium</i>.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have any changes to your vision, such as eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos, or colored images with red eyes while you are using aclidinium.
