</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Memantine ER Tablets</h2><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.</p><h2>Memantine ER Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended starting dose of memantine hydrochloride is 5 mg once daily. The dose should be increased in 5 mg increments to 10 mg/day (5 mg twice daily), 15 mg/day (5 mg and 10 mg as separate doses), and 20 mg/day (10 mg twice daily). The minimum recommended interval between dose increases is one week. The dosage shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials is 20 mg/day.</p><p>Memantine hydrochloride can be taken with or without food. If a patient misses a single dose of memantine hydrochloride, that patient should not double up on the next dose. The next dose should be taken as scheduled. If a patient fails to take memantine hydrochloride for several days, dosing may need to be resumed at lower doses and retitrated as described above.</p><p class="First">Special Populations</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>A target dose of 5 mg twice daily is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 5-29 mL/min based on the Cockroft-Gault equation).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Memantine hydrochloride should be administered with caution to patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride 5 mg tablet: Orange, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘C’ on one side and ‘331’ on other side.</p><p>Memantine hydrochloride 10 mg tablet: Grey, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘C’ on one side and ‘332’ on other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to memantine hydrochloride or to any excipients used in the formulation.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Genitourinary Conditions</h3><p class="First">Conditions that raise urine pH may decrease the urinary elimination of memantine resulting in increased plasma levels of memantine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride was evaluated in eight double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving a total of 1862 dementia (Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia) patients (940 patients treated with memantine hydrochloride and 922 patients treated with placebo) for a treatment period up to 28 weeks.</p><p>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation<br/></span> In placebo-controlled trials in which dementia patients received doses of memantine hydrochloride up to 20 mg/day, the likelihood of discontinuation because of an adverse reaction was the same in the memantine hydrochloride group (10.1%) as in the placebo group (11.5%). No individual adverse reaction was associated with the discontinuation of treatment in 1% or more of memantine hydrochloride-treated patients and at a rate greater than placebo.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Most Common Adverse Reactions<br/></span> In double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving dementia patients, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5% and higher than placebo) in patients treated with memantine hydrochloride were dizziness, headache, confusion and constipation. Table 1 lists all adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with memantine hydrochloride and at an incidence greater than placebo.</p><p>The overall profile of adverse reactions and the incidence rates for individual adverse reactions in the subpopulation of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease were not different from the profile and incidence rates described above for the overall dementia population.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Seizures</span></p><p>Memantine hydrochloride has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. In clinical trials of memantine hydrochloride, seizures occurred in 0.2% of patients treated with memantine hydrochloride and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of memantine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include:</p><p>Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders - agranulocytosis, leukopenia (including neutropenia), pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.</p><p>Cardiac Disorders - cardiac failure congestive.</p><p>Gastrointestinal Disorders - pancreatitis.</p><p>Hepatobiliary Disorders - hepatitis.</p><p>Psychiatric Disorders - suicidal ideation.</p><p>Renal and Urinary Disorders - acute renal failure (including increased creatinine and renal insufficiency).</p><p>Skin Disorders - Stevens Johnson syndrome.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs that Make the Urine Alkaline</h3><p class="First">The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8. Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g. renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions.</p><h3>Use with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists</h3><p class="First">The combined use of memantine hydrochloride with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category B</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of memantine in pregnant women. Memantine hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Memantine given orally to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic up to the highest doses tested (18 mg/kg/day in rats and 30 mg/kg/day in rabbits, which are 9 and 30 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis).</p><p>Slight maternal toxicity, decreased pup weights and an increased incidence of non-ossified cervical vertebrae were seen at an oral dose of 18 mg/kg/day in a study in which rats were given oral memantine beginning pre-mating and continuing through the postpartum period. Slight maternal toxicity and decreased pup weights were also seen at this dose in a study in which rats were treated from day 15 of gestation through the postpartum period. The no-effect dose for these effects was 6 mg/kg, which is 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when memantine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">The majority of people with Alzheimer’s disease are 65 years and older. In the clinical studies of memantine hydrochloride the mean age of patients was approximately 76; over 90% of patients were 65 years and older, 60% were 75 years and older, and 12% were at or above 85 years of age. The efficacy and safety data presented in the clinical trial sections were obtained from these patients. There were no clinically meaningful differences in most adverse events reported by patient groups ≥65 years old and &lt;65 year old.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. A dosage reduction is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Memantine hydrochloride should be administered with caution to patients with severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Signs and symptoms most often accompanying memantine overdosage in clinical trials and from worldwide marketing experience, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, include agitation, asthenia, bradycardia, confusion, coma, dizziness, ECG changes, increased blood pressure, lethargy, loss of consciousness, psychosis, restlessness, slowed movement, somnolence, stupor, unsteady gait, visual hallucinations, vertigo, vomiting, and weakness. The largest known ingestion of memantine worldwide was 2.0 grams in a patient who took memantine in conjunction with unspecified antidiabetic medications. The patient experienced coma, diplopia, and agitation, but subsequently recovered. Fatal outcome has been very rarely reported with memantine, and the relationship to memantine was unclear.</p><p>Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug. As in any cases of overdose, general supportive measures should be utilized, and treatment should be symptomatic. Elimination of memantine can be enhanced by acidification of urine.</p><h2>Memantine ER Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride, USP is an orally active NMDA receptor antagonist. The chemical name for memantine hydrochloride, USP  is 1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane hydrochloride with the following structural formula:</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">12</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>N•HCl and the molecular weight is 215.76. Memantine HCl, USP occurs as a fine white to off-white powder and is soluble in water.</p><p>Memantine hydrochloride, USP  is available as tablets. Memantine hydrochloride, USP  is available for oral administration as capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets containing 5 mg and 10 mg of memantine hydrochloride, USP. The tablets also contain the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide, and talc. In addition the following inactive ingredients are also present as components of the film coat: FD&amp;C blue #2, FD&amp;C yellow #6, hypromellose, macrogol/polyethylene glycol 400, and titanium dioxide (5 mg tablets), and hypromellose, iron oxide black, macrogol/polyethylene glycol 400, and titanium dioxide (10 mg tablets).</p><h2>Memantine ER Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Persistent activation of central nervous system N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer’s disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. There is no evidence that memantine prevents or slows neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Memantine showed low to negligible affinity for GABA, benzodiazepine, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine and glycine receptors and for voltage-dependent Ca<span class="Sup">2+</span>, Na<span class="Sup">+</span>or K<span class="Sup">+</span>channels. Memantine also showed antagonistic effects at the 5HT<span class="Sub">3</span> receptor with a potency similar to that for the NMDA receptor and blocked nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with one-sixth to one-tenth the potency.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have shown that memantine does not affect the reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by donepezil, galantamine, or tacrine.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral administration memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrations reached in about 3 to 7 hours. Memantine has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. Food has no effect on the absorption of memantine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution of memantine is 9 to 11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Memantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. The hepatic microsomal CYP450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of memantine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>Memantine is excreted predominantly (about 48%) unchanged in urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60 to 80 hours.</p><p>The remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy memantine, and 1-nitroso-deaminated memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. Renal clearance involves active tubular secretion moderated by pH dependent tubular reabsorption.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Gender</span></p><p>Following multiple dose administration of memantine hydrochloride 20 mg daily, females had about 45% higher exposure than males, but there was no difference in exposure when body weight was taken into account.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Elderly</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of memantine hydrochloride in young and elderly subjects are similar.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following single oral administration of 20 mg memantine HCl in 8 subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance, CL<span class="Sub">cr</span>, &gt;50 to 80 mL/min), 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> 30 to 49 mL/min), 7 subjects with severe renal impairment (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> 5 to 29 mL/min) and 8 healthy subjects (CL<span class="Sub">cr</span> &gt; 80 mL/min) matched as closely as possible by age, weight and gender to the subjects with renal impairment. Mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> increased by 4%, 60%, and 115% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The terminal elimination half-life increased by 18%, 41%, and 95% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.</p><p>No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. Dosage should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following the administration of single oral doses of 20 mg in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7 to 9) and 8 subjects who were age-, gender-, and weight-matched to the hepatically-impaired subjects. There was no change in memantine exposure (based on C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects. However, terminal elimination half-life increased by about 16% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. Memantine should be administered with caution to patients with severe hepatic impairment as the pharmacokinetics of memantine have not been evaluated in that population.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Drug-Drug Interactions</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use with Cholinesterase Inhibitors</span></p><p>Coadministration of memantine with the AChE inhibitor donepezil HCl did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either compound. Furthermore, memantine did not affect AChE inhibition by donepezil. In a 24-week controlled clinical study in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, the adverse event profile observed with a combination of memantine hydrochloride and donepezil was similar to that of donepezil alone.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effect of</span> <span class="Bold">Memantine Hydrochloride on the Metabolism of Other Drugs</span> </p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies conducted with marker substrates of CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, -2A6, -2C9, -2D6, -2E1, -3A4) showed minimal inhibition of these enzymes by memantine. In addition, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies indicate that at concentrations exceeding those associated with efficacy, memantine does not induce the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP1A2, -2C9, -2E1 and -3A4/5. No pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes are expected.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of memantine for interaction with warfarin, and buproprion. Memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2B6 substrate buproprion or its metabolite hydroxybuproprion. Furthermore, memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin as assessed by the prothrombin INR.</p><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">Effect of Other Drugs on</span> <span class="Bold">Memantine Hydrochloride</span> </p><p>Memantine is predominantly renally eliminated, and drugs that are substrates and/or inhibitors of the CYP450 system are not expected to alter the metabolism of memantine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs Eliminated via Renal Mechanisms</span></p><p>Because memantine is eliminated in part by tubular secretion, coadministration of drugs that use the same renal cationic system, including hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), triamterene (TA), metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, quinidine, and nicotine, could potentially result in altered plasma levels of both agents. However, coadministration of memantine hydrochloride and HCTZ/TA did not affect the bioavailability of either memantine or TA, and the bioavailability of HCTZ decreased by 20%. In addition, coadministration of memantine with the antihyperglycemic drug Glucovance<span class="Sup">®</span> (glyburide and metformin HCl) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of memantine, metformin and glyburide. Furthermore, memantine did not modify the serum glucose lowering effect of Glucovance<span class="Sup">®</span>, indicating the absence of a pharmacodynamic interaction.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins</span></p><p>Because the plasma protein binding of memantine is low (45%), an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to plasma proteins, such as warfarin and digoxin, is unlikely.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in a 113-week oral study in mice at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (10 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). There was also no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats orally dosed at up to 40 mg/kg/day for 71 weeks followed by 20 mg/kg/day (20 and 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis, respectively) through 128 weeks.</p><p>Memantine produced no evidence of genotoxic potential when evaluated in the <span class="Italics">in vitro S. typhimurium</span> or <span class="Italics">E. coli</span> reverse mutation assay, an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> cytogenetics assay for chromosome damage in rats, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse micronucleus assay. The results were equivocal in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> gene mutation assay using Chinese hamster V79 cells.</p><p>No impairment of fertility or reproductive performance was seen in rats administered up to 18 mg/kg/day (9 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis) orally from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and lactation in females, or for 60 days prior to mating in males.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Memantine induced neuronal lesions (vacuolation and necrosis) in the multipolar and pyramidal cells in cortical layers III and IV of the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial neocortices in rats, similar to those which are known to occur in rodents administered other NMDA receptor antagonists. Lesions were seen after a single dose of memantine. In a study in which rats were given daily oral doses of memantine for 14 days, the no-effect dose for neuronal necrosis was 6 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis.</p><p>In acute and repeat-dose neurotoxicity studies in female rats, oral administration of memantine and donepezil in combination resulted in increased incidence, severity, and distribution of neurodegeneration compared with memantine alone. The no-effect levels of the combination were associated with clinically relevant plasma memantine and donepezil exposures.</p><p>The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of memantine hydrochloride as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2) conducted in the United States that assessed both cognitive function and day-to-day function. The mean age of patients participating in these two trials was 76 with a range of 50 to 93 years. Approximately 66% of patients were female and 91% of patients were Caucasian. A third study (Study 3), carried out in Latvia, enrolled patients with severe dementia, but did not assess cognitive function as a planned endpoint. Study Outcome Measures: In each U.S. study, the effectiveness of memantine hydrochloride was determined using both an instrument designed to evaluate overall function through caregiver-related assessment, and an instrument that measures cognition. Both studies showed that patients on memantine hydrochloride experienced significant improvement on both measures compared to placebo.</p><p>Day-to-day function was assessed in both studies using the modified Alzheimer’s disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living inventory (ADCS-ADL). The ADCS-ADL consists of a comprehensive battery of ADL questions used to measure the functional capabilities of patients. Each ADL item is rated from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss. The investigator performs the inventory by interviewing a caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient. A subset of 19 items, including ratings of the patient’s ability to eat, dress, bathe, telephone, travel, shop, and perform other household chores has been validated for the assessment of patients with moderate to severe dementia. This is the modified ADCS-ADL, which has a scoring range of 0 to 54, with the lower scores indicating greater functional impairment.</p><p>The ability of memantine hydrochloride to improve cognitive performance was assessed in both studies with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), a multi-item instrument that has been validated for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. The SIB examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of attention, orientation, language, memory, visuospatial ability, construction, praxis, and social interaction. The SIB scoring range is from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 1 (Twenty-Eight-Week Study)</span></p><p>In a study of 28 weeks duration, 252 patients with moderate to severe probable Alzheimer’s disease (diagnosed by DSM-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores ≥ 3 and ≤ 14 and Global Deterioration Scale Stages 5-6) were randomized to memantine hydrochloride or placebo. For patients randomized to memantine hydrochloride, treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily and increased weekly by 5 mg/day in divided doses to a dose of 20 mg/day (10 mg twice a day).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the ADCS-ADL</span></p><p>Figure 1 shows the time course for the change from baseline in the ADCS-ADL score for patients in the two treatment groups completing the 28 weeks of the study.

For patients randomized to memantine hydrochloride, treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily and increased to 10 mg once daily after 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the care dependency subscale of the Behavioral Rating Scale for Geriatric Patients (BGP), a measure of day-to-day function, and a Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), a measure of overall clinical effect. No valid measure of cognitive function was used in this study. A statistically significant treatment difference at 12 weeks that favored memantine hydrochloride over placebo was seen on both primary efficacy measures. Because the patients entered were a mixture of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, an attempt was made to distinguish the two groups and all patients were later designated as having either vascular dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, based on their scores on the Hachinski Ischemic Scale at study entry. Only about 50% of the patients had computerized tomography of the brain. For the subset designated as having Alzheimer’s disease, a statistically significant treatment effect favoring memantine hydrochloride over placebo at 12 weeks was seen on both the BGP and CGI-C.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Memantine hydrochloride tablets, USP 5 mg: Orange, capsule-shaped, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘C’ on one side and ‘331’ on other side.<br/>
