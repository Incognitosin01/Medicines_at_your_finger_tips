It will not work for other infections or for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Cinoxacin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using cinoxacin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For cinoxacin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to cinoxacin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Since cinoxacin has been shown to cause bone development problems in young animals, its use is not recommended in children up to 18 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of cinoxacin in the elderly with use in other age groups, cinoxacin is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking cinoxacin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using cinoxacin with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Cholera Vaccine, Live</li>
</ul><p>Using cinoxacin with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Aminolevulinic Acid</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of cinoxacin. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Brain and spinal cord disorders</li>
<li>Convulsions</li>
<li>Tendinitis—Cinoxacin may make these conditions worse</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease—Patients with kidney disease may have an increased risk of side effects</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of cinoxacin</h2><p>Cinoxacin may be taken with food, unless you are otherwise directed by your doctor.</p><p>Do not give cinoxacin to infants or children under 18 years of age, unless otherwise directed by your doctor. It has been shown to cause bone development problems in young animals.</p><p>To help clear up your infection completely, keep taking cinoxacin for the full time of treatment, even if you begin to feel better after a few days. If you stop taking cinoxacin too soon, your symptoms may return.</p><p>Cinoxacin works best when there is a constant amount in the urine. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to take the doses at evenly spaced times, day and night. For example, if you are to take 4 doses a day, the doses should be spaced about 6 hours apart. If this interferes with your sleep or other daily activities, or if you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, check with your health care professional.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of cinoxacin will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of cinoxacin. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
