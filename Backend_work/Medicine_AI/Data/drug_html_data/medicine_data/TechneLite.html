</ul><p class="First">FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection, as eluted according to the elution instructions with Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc. TechneLite<span class="Sup">速</span>, Technetium Tc 99m Generator, is in Sodium Chloride 0.9% as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, diagnostic radiopharmaceutical suitable for intravenous injection and direct instillation. The pH is 4.5-7.5. The eluate should be clear, colorless, and free from visible foreign material. Each eluate of the TechneLite<span class="Sup">速</span>, Technetium Tc 99m Generator should not contain more than 0.0056MBq (0.15 microcuries) of Molybdenum Mo99 per 37MBq (1 millicurie) of Technetium Tc 99m per administered dose at the time of administration, and not more than 10 micrograms of aluminum per milliliter of the Technetium Tc 99m Generator eluate, both of which must be determined by the user before administration. Since the eluate does not contain an antimicrobial agent, it should not be used later than one (1) working day after the elution (12 hours).</p><p>Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc. TechneLite<span class="Sup">速</span>, Technetium Tc 99m Generator consists of a column containing fission produced Molybdenum Mo99 adsorbed on alumina. The terminally sterilized and sealed column is enclosed in a lead shield; the shield and other components are sealed in a cylindrical plastic container with an attached handle. Built into the top surface are two recessed wells marked SALINE CHARGE and COLLECT. Needles protruding from these two wells accommodate supplied sterile eluant charge vials and sterile eluate collection vials. The eluting solvent consists of Sodium Chloride 0.9%, prepacked into septum-sealed vials.</p><p>The eluate collection vial is evacuated, sterile and non-pyrogenic. A sterile 0.22 micrometer bacteriological filter is incorporated between the column outlet and the collection vials. During and subsequent to elution, the eluate collection vial should be kept in a radiation shield. The Generator is shipped with a silicone needle seal over the charge needle and a vented needle cover over the collect needle. A sterile vial containing bacteriostat is supplied for the customer to aseptically reseal the collect needle after each elution.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><p class="First">Technetium Tc 99m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half-life of 6.02 hours.<span class="Sup">1</span> Photons that are useful for imaging studies are listed in Table 1.</p><h3>External Radiation</h3><p class="First">The specific gamma ray constant for Technetium Tc 99m is 5.4 microcoulombs/Kg-MBq-hr (0.795 R/mCi-hr) at 1cm. The first half-value thickness is 0.023cm of lead (Pb). To facilitate control of radiation exposure from millicurie amounts of Technetium Tc 99m, for example, the use of a 0.27 cm thick standard radiation elution lead shield will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1000. A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of lead is shown in Table 2.</p><p><span class="Italics">NOTE</span>: Because the generator is well contained and essentially dry, there is little likelihood of contamination due to damage in transit.</p><p>Molybdenum Mo99 decays to Technetium Tc 99m with a Molybdenum Mo99 half-life of 66 hours. This means that only 78% of the activity remains after 24 hours; 60% remains after 48 hours, etc. (see Table 3). All units have a minimum of 38 mm, 1.5 inches (~ 6 half-value layers) of lead surrounding the activity. (See Table 3.)</p><p>The physical decay characteristics of Molybdenum Mo99 are such that approximately 88% of the decaying Molybdenum Mo99 atoms form Technetium Tc 99m. Since the Molybdenum Mo99 is constantly decaying to fresh Technetium Tc 99m, it is possible to elute the generator at any time. However, the total amount of Technetium Tc 99m available will depend on the time interval from the previous elution, the quantity of Molydenum Mo99 remaining and the efficiency of the elution. Approximately 47% of maximum Technetium Tc 99m is reached after 6 hours and 95% after 23 hours.</p><p>The elution vial shield has a wall thickness of 7.9 mm, 0.31 inches, and reduces transmitted Technetium Tc 99m radiation essentially to zero. To correct for physical decay of Tc 99m, the fractions that remain at selected intervals of time are shown in Table 4.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</span> The pertechnetate ion distributes in the body similarly to the iodide ion but is not organified when trapped in the thyroid gland. It also concentrates in the choroid plexus, thyroid gland, salivary glands, and stomach. However, in contrast to the iodide ion, the pertechnetate ion is released unchanged from the thyroid gland.</p><p>After intravascular administration the pertechnetate ion gradually equilibrates with the extracellular space. A fraction is promptly excreted via the kidneys.</p><p>Following the administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection as an eye drop, the drug mixes with tears within the conjunctival space. Within seconds to minutes it leaves the conjunctival space and escapes into the inferior meatus of the nose through the nasolacrimal drainage system. During this process the pertechnetate ion passes through the canaliculi, the lacrimal sac and the nasolacrimal duct. In the event of any anatomical or functional blockage of the drainage system there will be a backflow resulting in tearing (epiphora). Thus the pertechnetate escapes the conjunctival space in the tears.</p><p>While the major part of the pertechnetate escapes within a few minutes of normal drainage and tearing, it has been documented that there is some degree of transconjunctival absorption with a fractional turnover rate of 0.015/min in normal individuals, 0.021/min in patients without any sac and 0.027/min in patients with inflamed conjunctiva due to chronic dacryocystitis. Individual values may vary but these rates are probably representative and indicate that the maximum possible pertechnetate absorbed will remain below one thousandth of that used in other routine diagnostic procedures.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">The TechneLite generator is a source of sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m for use in the preparation of FDA-approved diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, as described in the labeling of these diagnostic radiopharmaceutical kits.</p><p>Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is used IN ADULTS as an agent for:</p><p>Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is used IN CHILDREN as an agent for:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> None known.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Radiation risks associated with the use of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection are greater in children than in adults and, in general, the younger the child, the greater the risk owing to greater absorbed radiation doses and longer life-expectancy. These greater risks should be taken firmly into account in all benefit-risk assessments involving children.</p><p>Long-term cumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">As in the use of any radioactive material, care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the patient consistent with proper patient management and to ensure minimum radiation exposure to occupational workers.</p><p>Since the eluate does not contain an antimicrobial agent, it should not be used after 12 hours from the time of TechneLite<span class="Sup">速</span>, Technetium Tc 99m Generator elution.</p><p>After the termination of the nasolacrimal imaging procedure, blowing the nose and washing the eyes with sterile distilled water or an isotonic sodium chloride solution will further minimize the radiation dose.</p><p>Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential or whether Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m affects fertility in males or females.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m. It is also not known whether Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p>Ideally examinations using radiopharmaceuticals, especially those elective in nature, of a woman of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few (approximately 10) days following the onset of menses.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m is excreted in human milk during lactation; therefore formula feedings should be substituted for breast feeding.</p><p>This radiopharmaceutical preparation should not be administered to pregnant or lactating women unless expected benefits to be gained outweigh the potential risks.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">See INDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections. Also see the description of additional risks under WARNINGS.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of TechneLite速 did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported infrequently following the administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</span> Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is usually administered by intravascular injection. For imaging the urinary bladder and ureters (direct isotopic cystography), the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection is administered by direct instillation aseptically into the bladder via a urethral catheter, following which the catheter is flushed with approximately 200 mL of sterile saline directly into the bladder. The dosage employed varies with each diagnostic procedure. When imaging the nasolacrimal drainage system, instill the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection by the use of a device such as a micropipette or similar method which will ensure the accuracy of the dose.</p><p>The suggested dose range employed for various diagnostic indications in the average ADULT PATIENT (70kg) is:</p><p>The recommended dosage range in PEDIATRIC PATIENTS is:</p><p>The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration of the dose.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. The solution to be administered as the patient dose should be clear and contain no particulate matter. Do not use an eluate of the TechneLite<span class="Sup">速</span>, Technetium Tc 99m Generator later than one (1) working day after elution (12 hours).</p><h3>Radiation Dosimetry</h3><p class="First">The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average ADULT and Pediatric patient from an intravenous injection of a maximum dose of 1110MBq (30 millicuries) of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection distributed uniformly in the total body are shown in Tables 5 and 6.</p><p>The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average ADULT from the instillation of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection for imaging the nasolacrimal drainage system are shown in Table 7.</p><p>In pediatric patients, an average 30 minute exposure to 37MBq (1 millicurie) of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection following instillation for direct cystography, results in an estimated absorbed radiation dose shown in Table 8.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED:</span> Lantheus Medical Imaging TechneLite<span class="Sup">速</span>, Technetium Tc 99m Generator is available in the following quantities of radioactivity of Mo99 on the calibration date (date of manufacture) as specified on the product lot identification label affixed to the generator:</p><p>Each generator is supplied with the following standard components:</p><p>First order generators are shipped with the following accessory components:</p><p>Additional quantities of these components may be obtained at the customer's request.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">STORAGE:</span> Controlled room temperature 20属 to 25属C (68属 to 77属F) [See USP].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EXPIRATION:</span> The expiration time of the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m solution is not later than 12 hours after elution. If the eluate is to be used to reconstitute a kit for the preparation of a Technetium Tc 99m radiopharmaceutical, the kit should not be used after 12 hours from time of Generator elution or after the expiration time stated on the labeling for the prepared drug, whichever is earlier.</p><p>The generator should not be used after the expiration date stated on the label.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ELUTION INSTRUCTIONS - TOTAL ELUTION METHOD</span></p><h3>ASSAY INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TechneLite速, TECHNETIUM Tc 99m GENERATOR ELUATE</h3><p class="First">The TechneLite<span class="Sup">速</span>, Technetium Tc 99m Generator Eluate may be assayed using an ionization chamber dose calibrator. The manufacturer's instructions for operation of the dose calibrator should be followed for measurement of Technetium Tc 99m and Molybdenum Mo99 activity in the generator eluate. The Molybdenum 99/Technetium 99m ratio is to be determined at the time of each elution prior to administration, and from that ratio, the expiration time (up to 12 hours) of the eluate mathematically determined. Each eluate must meet or exceed the purity requirements of the current United States Pharmacopeia; that is, not more than 0.0056MBq (0.15 microcurie) of Molybdenum 99 per 37MBq (1 millicurie) of Technetium 99m per administered dose at the time of administration.</p><h3>RADIOMETRIC MOLYBDENUM TEST PROCEDURE</h3><p class="First">This method is based on the fact that most Technetium Tc 99m radiation can be readily shielded and only the more energetic gamma rays from Molybdenum Mo99 (739KeV and 778KeV) are counted in the 550-850KeV energy range. The entire eluate may be assayed for Molybdenum Mo99 activity as follows:</p><p>Divide this number by the mCi of Technetium Tc 99m. This result (袖Ci Mo99/mCi Tc 99m) can be converted to MBq Mo99/MBq Tc 99m by multiplying by 10<span class="Sup">-3</span>. The U.S. Pharmacopeia and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission or equivalent Agreement State regulations specify a limit of 0.00015MBq Molybdenum Mo99 per MBq of Technetium Tc 99m (0.15袖Ci Mo99/mCi Tc 99m) at the time of administration to each patient. If this limit is exceeded, the eluate should not be used. Discard the eluate and contact Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc.</p><h3>COLORIMETRIC ALUMINUM ION TEST PROCEDURE</h3><p class="First">Obtain an aluminum ion indicator kit and determine the aluminum ion concentration of the eluate per the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration must not exceed 10 micrograms per milliliter of eluate.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DISPOSAL:</span> All components shipped with the TechneLite<span class="Sup">速</span>, Technetium Tc 99m Generator should be monitored for contamination prior to disposing into routine trash systems. The Technetium Tc 99m should not be disposed of into routine trash systems. The generator should be disposed through a USNRC or Agreement State licensed disposal agency or by a method approved by the appropriate regulatory authority. Spent generators may be returned; <span class="Bold">complete return instructions are available on request.</span></p><p>This radioactive drug is approved for distribution to persons licensed pursuant to the Code of Massachusetts Regulations 105 CMR 120.100 for the uses listed in 105 CMR 120.547 or 120.552 or under equivalent regulations of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commision, an Agreement State or a Licensing State.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lantheus<br/>
