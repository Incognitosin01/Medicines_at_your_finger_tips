It works by decreasing cell activity in the body's immune system which helps to slow down the growth of atopic dermatitis (eczema) on your skin.</p><p>Protopic is used to treat severe atopic dermatitis (eczema).</p><p>Protopic may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Protopic if you are allergic to tacrolimus.</p><p>Before using Protopic, tell your doctor if you have skin cancer or a skin infection (including herpes or chickenpox), any genetic skin disorder (such as Netherton's syndrome), a weak immune system, kidney disease, or swelling, redness, or irritation of large areas of your skin.</p><p>Protopic can lower the blood cells that help your body fight infections.

Tell your doctor if you have been exposed to any illness.</p><p>Avoid sunlight, sun lamps, tanning beds, and phototherapy treatments with UVA or UVB light. If you must be outdoors, wear loose clothing over the skin areas treated with Protopic.
