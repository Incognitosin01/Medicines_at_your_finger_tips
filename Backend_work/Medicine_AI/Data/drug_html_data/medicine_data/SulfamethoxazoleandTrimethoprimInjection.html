</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection</h2><h2 class="Italics">1.1 Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia</h2><p class="First"> Limitation of Use:</p><p> Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors. (1.3)</p><p><span class="Bold"> To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria</span></p><h3>Shigellosis</h3><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection is indicated in the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Shigella flexneri</span> and <span class="Italics">Shigella sonnei</span> in adults and pediatric patients two months of age and older.</p><h3>Urinary Tract Infections</h3><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection is indicated in the treatment of severe or complicated urinary tract infections in adults and pediatric patients two months of age and older due to susceptible strains of <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Klebsiella</span> species, <span class="Italics">Enterobacter</span> species, <span class="Italics">Morganella morganii</span> and <span class="Italics">Proteus</span> species when oral administration of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection is not feasible and when the organism is not susceptible to single-agent antibacterials effective in the urinary tract.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>Although appropriate culture and susceptibility studies should be performed, therapy may be started while awaiting the results of these studies.</p><h2>Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients (Two Months of Age and Older)</h3><p class="First">The maximum recommended daily dose is 60 mL (960 mg trimethoprim) per day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients (Two Months of Age and Older) by Indication:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">*</span> A total daily dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg was sufficient in 10 adult patients with normal renal function in a published literature.<span class="Sup">1</span> </p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Impaired Renal Function</h3><p class="First">When renal function is impaired, a reduced dosage should be employed, as shown in Table 2.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Impaired Renal Function Dosage Guidelines  </span></p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Administer the solution by intravenous infusion over a period of 60 to 90 minutes. Avoid administration by rapid infusion or bolus injection. Do <span class="Bold">NOT</span> administer Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection intramuscularly.</p><p>Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.</p><h3>Method of Preparation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dilution of Single- and Multiple-Dose Vials</span></p><p>Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection must be diluted. Each 5 mL should be added to 125 mL of 5% dextrose in water. After diluting with 5% dextrose in water, the solution should not be refrigerated and should be used within 6 hours.</p><p>If a dilution of 5 mL per 100 mL of 5% dextrose in water is desired, it should be used within 4 hours. In those instances where fluid restriction is desirable, each 5 mL may be added to 75 mL of 5% dextrose in water. Under these circumstances the solution should be mixed just prior to use and should be administered within 2 hours.</p><p>If upon visual inspection there is cloudiness or evidence of crystallization after mixing, the solution should be discarded and a fresh solution prepared.</p><p>Do <span class="Bold">NOT</span> mix Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in 5% dextrose in water with drugs or solutions in the same container.</p><p><span class="Bold">Multiple-dose Vials (Handling)</span></p><p>After initial entry into the vial, the remaining contents must be used within 48 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infusion Systems for Intravenous Administration</span> </p><p>The following infusion systems have been tested and found satisfactory: unit-dose glass containers; unit-dose polyvinyl chloride and polyolefin containers. No other systems have been tested and therefore no others can be recommended.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection, USP is available as an injection containing 80 mg/mL of sulfamethoxazole and 16 mg/mL of trimethoprim in 5 mL single-dose, 10 mL single-dose and 30 mL multiple-dose vials.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection is contraindicated in the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>History of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia with use of trimethoprim and/or sulfonamides <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Patients with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span></li>
<li>Pediatric patients less than two months of age <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span></li>
<li>Marked hepatic damage <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10, 5.13)]</span></li>
<li>Severe renal insufficiency when renal function status cannot be monitored <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10, 5.13)]</span></li>
<li>Concomitant administration with dofetilide<span class="Sup">2,3</span><span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Embryo-fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Some epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. If Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be advised of the potential hazards to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><h3>Hypersensitivity and Other Fatal Reactions</h3><p class="First">Fatalities associated with the administration of sulfonamides, have occurred due to severe reactions, including, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias.</p><p>Sulfonamides, including sulfonamide-containing products such as Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection, should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction. Clinical signs, such as rash, sore throat, fever, arthralgia, cough, shortness of breath, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions. A skin rash may be followed by more severe reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis or serious blood disorder. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfonamides. Cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates are hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract that have been reported in association with sulfonamide treatment.</p><h3>Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicity. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection.</p><h3>Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever</h3><p class="First">Avoid use of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. Clinical studies have documented that patients with group A β-hemolytic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis have a greater incidence of bacteriologic failure when treated with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection than do those patients treated with penicillin, as evidenced by failure to eradicate this organism from the tonsillopharyngeal area. Therefore, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Sulfite Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.</p><h3>Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity in Pediatric Patients ("Gasping Syndrome")</h3><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved formulations in infusion solutions, including Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than two months of age <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>When prescribing Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in pediatric patients (two months of age and older), consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection (contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>Risk Associated with Concurrent Use of Leucovorin for Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia</h3><p class="First">Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in a randomized placebo controlled trial.<span class="Sup">4</span> Avoid coadministration of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection and leucovorin during treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia.</p><h3>Propylene Glycol Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection contains propylene glycol as a solvent (40% v/v). When administered at high doses as for the treatment of <span class="Italics">P. jirovecii</span> pneumonia and concomitantly with other products that contain propylene glycol, hyperosmolarity with anion gap metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis can occur. Propylene glycol toxicity can lead to acute kidney injury, CNS toxicity, and multi-organ failure. Monitor for the total daily intake of propylene glycol from all sources and for acid-base disturbances. Discontinue Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection if propylene glycol toxicity is suspected <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Folate Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Avoid use of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, in those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma.</p><p>Hematologic changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span> </p><h3>Hemolysis</h3><p class="First">In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related.</p><h3>Infusion Reactions</h3><p class="First">Local irritation and inflammation due to extravascular infiltration of the infusion have been observed with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection. If these occur the infusion should be discontinued and restarted at another site.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection have been seen, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection are particularly at risk.</p><h3>Impaired Phenylalanine Metabolism</h3><p class="First">Trimethoprim, component of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection, has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.</p><h3>Porphyria and Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First">Like other drugs containing sulfonamides, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection can precipitate porphyria crisis and hypothyroidism. Avoid use of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in patients with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction.</p><h3>Potential Risk in the Treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)</h3><p class="First">AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of adverse reactions, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in non-AIDS patients. If a patient develops skin rash or any sign of an adverse reaction, reevaluate therapy with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><p>Avoid coadministration of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection and leucovorin during treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span></p><h3>Electrolyte Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with <span class="Italics">P. jirovecii</span> pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.</p><p>Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection, particularly for the treatment of <span class="Italics">P. jirovecii</span> pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.</p><p>During treatment, ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.</p><h3>Monitoring of Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection. Discontinue Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, and anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria).</p><p>Local reaction, pain and slight irritation on intravenous (IV) administration are infrequent. Thrombophlebitis has been observed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection</span></p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:</p><p>          Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura</p><p>          Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</p><p>          QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia and <span class="Italics">torsade</span> <span class="Italics">de pointes</span></p><p>          Metabolic acidosis</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Potential for Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection to Affect Other Drugs</span></p><p>Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Drug Interactions with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection</span></p><h3>Interactions with Laboratory or Diagnostic Testing</h3><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA).</p><p>The presence of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection may also interfere with the Jaff¡SR alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal values.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection may cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant woman. Some epidemiologic studies suggest that exposure to Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot <span class="Italics">[see Human Data].</span></p><p>One of 3 rat studies showed cleft palate at doses approximately 5 times the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis; the other 2 studies did not show teratogenicity at similar doses. Studies in pregnant rabbits showed increased fetal loss at approximately 6 times the human dose on a body surface area basis <span class="Italics">[see Animal Data].</span></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential harm of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations].</span> </p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Urinary tract infection in pregnancy is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and pre-eclampsia, and increased mortality to the pregnant woman. <span class="Italics">P. jirovecii</span> pneumonia in pregnancy is associated with preterm birth and increased morbidity and mortality for the pregnant woman. Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>While there are no large, prospective, well-controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons and confounders. These studies are further limited by recall, selection, and information biases, and by limited generalizability of their findings. Lastly, outcome measures varied between studies, limiting cross-study comparisons.</p><p>Alternatively, other epidemiologic studies did not detect statistically significant associations between Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection exposure and specific malformations. Brumfitt and Pursell,<span class="Sup">10</span> in a retrospective study, reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4.5% (3 of 66) in those who received placebo and 3.3% (4 of 120) in those receiving trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first trimester. In a separate survey, Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole at the time of conception or shortly thereafter.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Levels of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in breast milk are approximately 2 to 5% of the recommended daily dose for pediatric patients over two months of age. There is no information regarding the effect of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection on the breastfed infant or the effect on milk production. Because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus on the breastfed child <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>, advise women to avoid breastfeeding during treatment with Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection is contraindicated in pediatric patients younger than two months of age because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the "gasping syndrome" occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received benzyl alcohol as a preservative in infusion solutions. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol.</p><p>When prescribing Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in pediatric patients consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection (Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><p>There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10), Adverse Reactions (6.1)],</span> a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients.</p><p>In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p>Hematologic changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><p>The trimethoprim component of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Acute</span></p><p>Since there has been no extensive experience in humans with single doses of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection in excess of 25 mL (400 mg trimethoprim and 2000 mg sulfamethoxazole), the maximum tolerated dose in humans is unknown.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of overdosage reported with sulfonamides include anorexia, colic, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, drowsiness and unconsciousness. Pyrexia, hematuria and crystalluria may be noted. Blood dyscrasias and jaundice are potential late manifestations of overdosage.</p><p>Signs of acute overdosage with trimethoprim include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, mental depression, confusion and bone marrow depression.</p><p>General principles of treatment include the administration of intravenous fluids if urine output is low and renal function is normal. Acidification of the urine will increase renal elimination of trimethoprim. The patient should be monitored with blood counts and appropriate blood chemistries, including electrolytes. If a significant blood dyscrasia or jaundice occurs, specific therapy should be instituted for these complications. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective and hemodialysis is only moderately effective in eliminating trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole.</p><p><span class="Bold">Chronic</span></p><p>Use of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection at high doses and/or for extended periods of time may cause bone marrow depression manifested as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and/or megaloblastic anemia. If signs of bone marrow depression occur, the patient should be given leucovorin 5 to 15 mg daily until normal hematopoiesis is restored.</p><h2>Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection, a sterile solution for intravenous infusion only, is a combination of sulfamethoxazole, a sulfonamide antimicrobial, and trimethoprim, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor antibacterial. Each mL contains Sulfamethoxazole, USP 80 mg; trimethoprim, USP 16 mg; benzyl alcohol 10 mg (1.0% v/v and 1.0% w/v) as preservatives; diethanolamine 3 mg (0.3% v/v and 0.3% w/v); ethyl alcohol 100 mg (12.3%v/v and 10.0% w/v); propylene glycol 400 mg (38.6% v/v and 40.0% w/v); sodium metabisulfite 1 mg as an antioxidant; water for injection q.s.; air replaced with nitrogen; pH adjusted with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid if necessary.</p><p>Trimethoprim is 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine.

Following repeated intravenous administration of the same dose at 8-hour intervals, the mean plasma concentrations just prior to and immediately after each infusion at steady state were 5.6 ± 0.6 μg/mL and 8.8 ± 0.9 μg/mL for trimethoprim and 70.6 ± 7.3 μg/mL and 105.6 ± 10.9 μg/mL for sulfamethoxazole. The mean plasma half-life was 11.3 ± 0.7 hours for trimethoprim and 12.8 ± 1.8 hours for sulfamethoxazole. All of these 11 patients had normal renal function, and their ages ranged from 17 to 78 years (median, 60 years).<span class="Sup">11</span></p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies in children and adults suggest an age-dependent half-life of trimethoprim, as indicated in <span class="Bold">Table 5</span>.<span class="Sup">12</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5: Half-life of Trimethoprim (TMP) in Pediatric Patients and Adults</span></p><p>Patients with severely impaired renal function exhibit an increase in the half-lives of both components, requiring dosage regimen adjustment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole exist in the blood as unbound, protein-bound and metabolized forms; sulfamethoxazole also exists as the conjugated form.</p><p>Approximately 44% of trimethoprim and 70% of sulfamethoxazole are bound to plasma proteins. The presence of 10 mg percent sulfamethoxazole in plasma decreases the protein binding of trimethoprim by an insignificant degree; trimethoprim does not influence the protein binding of sulfamethoxazole.</p><p>Both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole distribute to sputum and vaginal fluid; trimethoprim also distributes to bronchial secretions, and both pass the placental barrier and are excreted in breast milk.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p>Metabolism</p><p>Sulfamethoxazole is metabolized in humans to at least 5 metabolites: the N<span class="Sub">4</span>-acetyl-, N4-hydroxy-, 5methylhydroxy-, N<span class="Sub">4</span>-acetyl-5-methylhydroxy- sulfamethoxazole metabolites, and an N-glucuronide conjugate. The formation of N<span class="Sub">4</span>-hydroxy metabolite is mediated via CYP2C9.</p><p>Trimethoprim is metabolized in vitro to 11 different metabolites, of which, five are glutathione adducts and six are oxidative metabolites, including the major metabolites, 1- and 3-oxides and the 3- and 4hydroxy derivatives.</p><p>The free forms of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are considered to be the therapeutically active forms. In vitro studies suggest that trimethoprim is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, OCT1 and OCT2, and that sulfamethoxazole is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Excretion of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is primarily by the kidneys through both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Urine concentrations of both trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are considerably higher than are the concentrations in the blood. The percent of dose excreted in urine over a 12-hour period following the intravenous administration of the first dose of 240 mg of trimethoprim and 1200 mg of sulfamethoxazole on day 1 ranged from 17% to 42.4% as free trimethoprim; 7% to 12.7% as free sulfamethoxazole; and 36.7% to 56% as total (free plus the N4-acetylated metabolite) sulfamethoxazole. When administered together as Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection, neither trimethoprim nor sulfamethoxazole affects the urinary excretion pattern of the other.</p><p><span class="Italics">Specific Populations</span></p><p>Geriatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg were studied in six geriatric subjects (mean age: 78.6 years) and six young healthy subjects (mean age: 29.3 years) using a non-US approved formulation. Pharmacokinetic values for sulfamethoxazole in geriatric subjects were similar to those observed in young adult subjects. The mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was significantly lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects (19 mL/h/kg vs. 55 mL/h/kg). However, after normalizing by body weight, the apparent total body clearance of trimethoprim was on average 19% lower in geriatric subjects compared with young adult subjects.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with <span class="Italics">para</span>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA).
