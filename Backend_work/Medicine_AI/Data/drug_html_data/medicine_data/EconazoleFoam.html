</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Econazole Foam</h2><p class="First">Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1%, is indicated for the treatment of interdigital tinea pedis caused by <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes,</span> and <span class="Italics">Epidermophyton floccosum</span> in patients 12 years of age and older.</p><h2>Econazole Foam Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% is for topical use only. Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><p>Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% should be applied to cover affected areas once daily for 4 weeks.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Foam, 1%. Each gram of Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1%, contains 10 mg of econazole nitrate in a white to off-white foam.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Flammability</h3><p class="First">Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% is flammable. Avoid heat, flame, and smoking during and immediately following application. Contents under pressure. Do not puncture and/or incinerate the containers. Do not expose containers to heat and/or store at temperatures above 120°F (49°C) even when empty. Do not store in direct sunlight.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In two double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, 495 subjects were exposed to Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% or vehicle (246 subjects were exposed to Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% and 249 were exposed to vehicle). Subjects with interdigital tinea pedis applied foam or vehicle once daily for approximately 28 days. During clinical trials with Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1%, the most common adverse reactions were application site reactions which occurred in less than 1% of subjects in both the Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% and vehicle arms. </p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of econazole and warfarin has resulted in enhancement of anticoagulant effect. Most cases reported product application with use under occlusion, genital application, or application to a large body surface area which may increase the systemic absorption of econazole nitrate. Monitoring of International Normalized Ratio (INR) and/or prothrombin time may be indicated especially for patients who apply econazole to large body surface areas, in the genital area, or under occlusion.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled trials with Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% in pregnant women. Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>Econazole nitrate has not been shown to be teratogenic when administered orally to mice, rabbits or rats. Fetotoxic or embryotoxic effects were observed in Segment I oral studies with rats receiving 10 to 40 times the human dermal dose. Similar effects were observed in Segment II or Segment III studies with mice, rabbits and/or rats receiving oral doses 80 or 40 times the human dermal dose.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether econazole nitrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when econazole nitrate is administered to a nursing woman. Following oral administration of econazole nitrate to lactating rats, econazole and/or metabolites were excreted in milk and were found in nursing pups.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 173 subjects treated with Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% in the clinical trials, 2 subjects were 12-17 years old.  In a pediatric maximal use trial, Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% was applied once daily to eighteen subjects aged 12 to 17 years with interdigital tinea pedis for 28 days [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. The safety findings for subjects 12 to 17 years were similar to those in adult population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 173 subjects treated with Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% in the adult clinical trials, 6 subjects were 65 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.</p><h2>Econazole Foam Description</h2><p class="First">Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% contains the azole antifungal agent, econazole nitrate in an oil-in-water emulsion base consisting of the following inactive ingredients: dimethicone, glycerin, polysorbate 20, povidone, propylene glycol, stearic acid, trolamine, purified water and butane as a propellant. Each gram of Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% contains 10 mg of econazole nitrate, USP, in a white to off-white foam. Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% is alcohol (ethanol)-free and for topical use only.</p><p>Chemically, econazole nitrate is 1-[2-{(4-chloro-phenyl)methoxy}-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole mononitrate. Econazole nitrate has the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">15</span>Cl<span class="Sub">3</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O.HNO<span class="Sub">3</span> and a molecular weight of 444.70. Its molecular structure is as follows:</p><p></p><h2>Econazole Foam - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% is an azole antifungal [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)</span>]<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">.</span></span></p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacodynamics of Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% have not been established<span class="Bold">.</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The systemic absorption of Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% following topical application was studied in one clinical trial in adults and one clinical study in pediatric subjects.</p><p>In the adult trial, 19 subjects (male and female) with tinea pedis applied Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% once daily for 29 days.  Subjects applied a mean daily amount of 2.4 g of Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% to soles, toes, interdigital spaces and tops of both feet up to the ankles. Blood samples were obtained on Day 29 at pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after application.  Results (mean ± SD) showed the time to reach peak plasma concentrations (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 6.8 ± 5.1 h with maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of 417 ± 218 pg/ml. The area under the concentration time curve for the first 12 hours post application on Day 29 (AUC<span class="Sub">(0-12)</span>) was 3440 ± 1920 pg-h/ml. </p><p>In the pediatric trial, 18 subjects (male and female ages 12 - 17) with interdigital tinea pedis and positive fungal cultures were treated with Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% once daily for 4 weeks.  Subjects applied a mean daily amount of 3.2 g of Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% to soles, toes, interdigital spaces and tops of both feet up to the ankles.  Blood samples were obtained on Day 28 at pre-dose and 7 h and 11 h post-dose. The mean ± SD econazole plasma concentration was 397 ± 289, 534 ± 745 and 575 ± 638 pg/mL at pre-dose and 7 h and 11 h post-dose, respectively.   </p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></span></p><p>Econazole nitrate, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the fungistatic activity of econazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to econazole inhibition.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Activity in vitro and in clinical infections</span></span></p><p>Econazole nitrate has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [<span class="Italics">see Indications and Usage (1)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum<br/></span> <span class="Italics">Epidermophyton floccosum<br/></span> <span class="Italics">Trichophyton mentagrophytes</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% have not been performed.</p><p>Oral administration of econazole nitrate in rats has been reported to produce prolonged gestation.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In two multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials a total of 505 subjects with interdigital tinea pedis were randomized 1:1 to Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% or vehicle; subjects applied the assigned medication once daily for 4 weeks. The severity of erythema, scaling, fissuring, maceration, vesiculation, and pruritus were graded using a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe). Subjects had KOH examination and fungal cultures taken to confirm eligibility. A total of 339 subjects with positive fungal cultures were evaluated for efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated on Day 43, 2 weeks post-treatment with treatment success being defined as complete cure (negative KOH and fungal culture and no evidence of clinical disease). The study population ranged in age from 12 to 71 years with 3 subjects less than 18 years of age at baseline. The subjects were 71% male and 52% Caucasian. Table 1 presents the efficacy results for each trial.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED/ STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First">Econazole Nitrate Topical Foam, 1% is white to off-white foam supplied in 70 g (NDC 70700-100-70) aluminum pressurized canister.</p><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) with excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).
