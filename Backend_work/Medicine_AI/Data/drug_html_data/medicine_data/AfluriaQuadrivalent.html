</ul><p>The dose and schedule for Afluria Quadrivalent are presented in Table 1.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span>1 or 2 doses depends on vaccination history as per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices annual recommendations on prevention and control of influenza with vaccines.</p><p>Immediately before use, shake thoroughly and inspect visually. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever suspension and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.</p><p>When using the single-dose pre-filled syringe, shake the syringe thoroughly and administer the dose immediately.</p><p>When using the multi-dose vial, shake the vial thoroughly before withdrawing each dose, and administer the dose immediately. The number of needle punctures should not exceed 20 per multi-dose vial.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Needle and Syringe: Draw up the exact dose using a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual patient. It is recommended that small syringes (0.5 mL or 1 mL) be used to minimize any product loss.</li>
<li>PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System: For instructions on withdrawal of a 0.5 mL dose and use of the PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System, refer to the Instructions For Use for the PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System.</li>
</ul><p>The preferred sites for intramuscular injection are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants 6 months through 11 months of age, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm if muscle mass is adequate) in persons 12 months through 35 months of age, or the deltoid muscle of the upper arm in persons ≥ 36 months of age.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Afluria Quadrivalent is a sterile suspension for intramuscular injection (<span class="Italics">see Description [11])</span>.</p><p>Afluria Quadrivalent is supplied in three presentations:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>0.25 mL pre-filled syringe (single dose, for persons 6 months through 35 months of age)</li>
<li>0.5 mL pre-filled syringe (single dose, for persons 36 months of age and older).</li>
<li>5 mL multi-dose vial (for persons 6 months of age and older).</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Afluria Quadrivalent is contraindicated in individuals with known severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine including egg protein, or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (<span class="Italics">see Description [11])</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h3><p class="First">If Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) has occurred within 6 weeks of previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give Afluria Quadrivalent should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.</p><p>The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an increased frequency of GBS. Evidence for a causal relation of GBS with subsequent vaccines prepared from other influenza viruses is unclear. If influenza vaccine does pose a risk, it is probably slightly more than one additional case per 1 million persons vaccinated.</p><h3>Preventing and Managing Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine.</p><h3>Altered Immunocompetence</h3><p class="First">If Afluria Quadrivalent is administered to immunocompromised persons, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the immune response may be diminished.</p><h3>Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness</h3><p class="First">Vaccination with Afluria Quadrivalent may not protect all individuals.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In adults 18 through 64 years of age, the most commonly reported injection-site adverse reaction observed in clinical studies with Afluria Quadrivalent administered by needle and syringe was pain (≥ 40%).

The most common systemic adverse event observed was myalgia (≥ 10%).</p><p>The safety experience with AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) is relevant to Afluria Quadrivalent because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions (see <span class="Italics">Description [11]</span>).</p><p>In adults 18 through 64 years of age, the most commonly reported injection-site adverse reactions observed in a clinical study with AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) using the PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System were tenderness (≥ 80%), swelling, pain, redness (≥ 60%), itching (≥ 20%) and bruising (≥ 10%). The most common systemic adverse events were myalgia, malaise (≥ 30%) and headache (≥ 20%).</p><p>In children 5 through 8 years, the most commonly reported injection-site adverse reactions when Afluria Quadrivalent was administered by needle and syringe were pain (≥ 50%) and redness and swelling (≥ 10%). The most common systemic adverse event was headache (≥ 10%).</p><p>In children 9 through 17 years, the most commonly reported injection-site adverse reactions when Afluria Quadrivalent was administered by needle and syringe were pain (≥ 50%) and redness and swelling (≥ 10%). The most common systemic adverse events were headache, myalgia, and malaise and fatigue (≥ 10%).</p><p>In children 6 months through 35 months of age, the most frequently reported injection site reactions in the clinical study with Afluria Quadrivalent administered by needle and syringe were pain and redness (≥ 20%). The most common systemic adverse events were irritability (≥ 30%), diarrhea and loss of appetite (≥ 20%).</p><p>In children 36 through 59 months of age, the most commonly reported injection site reactions were pain (≥ 30%) and redness (≥ 20%). The most commonly reported systemic adverse events were malaise and fatigue, and diarrhea (≥ 10%).</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Adults</span></p><p>Clinical safety data for Afluria Quadrivalent in adults have been collected in one clinical trial, Study 1, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in the U.S. in 3449 subjects ages 18 years and older. Subjects in the safety population received one dose of either Afluria Quadrivalent (N=1721) or one of two formulations of comparator trivalent influenza vaccine (AFLURIA, TIV-1 N=864 or TIV-2 N=864) each containing an influenza type B virus that corresponded to one of the two B viruses in Afluria Quadrivalent (a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage or a type B virus of the Victoria lineage), respectively. The mean age of the population was 58 years, 57% were female, and racial groups consisted of 82% White, 16% Black, and 2% other; 5% of subjects were Hispanic/Latino.

Afluria Quadrivalent is prepared from influenza virus propagated in the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs. Following harvest, the virus is purified in a sucrose density gradient using continuous flow zonal centrifugation. The purified virus is inactivated with beta-propiolactone, and the virus particles are disrupted using sodium taurodeoxycholate to produce a “split virion”. The disrupted virus is further purified and suspended in a phosphate buffered isotonic solution.</p><p>Afluria Quadrivalent is standardized according to USPHS requirements for the 2020-2021 influenza season and is formulated to contain 60 mcg hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose in the recommended ratio of 15 mcg HA for each of the four influenza strains recommended for the 2020-2021 Northern Hemisphere influenza season:</p><p>A/Victoria/2454/2019 IVR-207 (an A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus), A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 IVR-208 (an A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2)-like virus), B/Victoria/705/2018 BVR-11 (a B/Washington/02/2019-like virus) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 BVR-1B (a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus). A 0.25 mL dose contains 7.5 mcg HA of each of the same four influenza strains.</p><p>Thimerosal, a mercury derivative, is not used in the manufacturing process for the single dose presentation. This presentation does not contain preservative. The multi-dose presentation contains thimerosal added as a preservative; each 0.5 mL dose contains 24.5 mcg of mercury and each 0.25 mL dose contains 12.25 mcg of mercury.</p><p>A single 0.5 mL dose of Afluria Quadrivalent contains sodium chloride (4.1 mg), monobasic sodium phosphate (80 mcg), dibasic sodium phosphate (300 mcg), monobasic potassium phosphate (20 mcg), potassium chloride (20 mcg), and calcium chloride (0.5 mcg). From the manufacturing process, each 0.5 mL dose may also contain residual amounts of sodium taurodeoxycholate (≤ 10 ppm), ovalbumin (&lt; 1 mcg), sucrose (&lt; 10 mcg), neomycin sulfate (≤ 81.8 nanograms [ng]), polymyxin B (≤ 14 ng), beta-propiolactone (≤ 1.5 ng) and hydrocortisone (≤ 0.56 ng). A single 0.25 mL dose of Afluria Quadrivalent contains half of these quantities.</p><p>The rubber tip cap and plunger used for the preservative-free, single-dose syringes and the rubber stoppers used for the multi-dose vial were not made with natural rubber latex.</p><h2>Afluria Quadrivalent - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Influenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. For example, since 1977 antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Since 2001, two distinct lineages of influenza B (Victoria and Yamagata lineages) have co-circulated worldwide. Specific levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers post-vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus. In some human studies, antibody titers of 1:40 or greater have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects.<span class="Sup">2,3</span></p><p>Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual change to one or more new strains in each year's influenza vaccine. Therefore, inactivated influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the HA of four strains (i.e., typically two type A and two type B) representing the influenza viruses likely to be circulating in the U.S. during the upcoming winter.</p><p>Annual revaccination with the current vaccine is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Afluria Quadrivalent has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or male infertility in animals. A developmental toxicity study conducted in rats vaccinated with AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) revealed no impact on female fertility (see <span class="Italics">Pregnancy [8.1]</span>).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Efficacy Against Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) is relevant to Afluria Quadrivalent because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions (<span class="Italics">see Description [11]</span>).</p><p>The efficacy of AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) was demonstrated in Study 5, a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 15,044 subjects. Healthy subjects 18 through 64 years of age were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single dose of AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) (enrolled subjects: 10,033; evaluable subjects: 9,889) or placebo (enrolled subjects: 5,011; evaluable subjects: 4,960). The mean age of all randomized subjects was 35.5 years. 54.4% were female and 90.2% were White. Laboratory-confirmed influenza was assessed by active and passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) beginning 2 weeks post-vaccination until the end of the influenza season, approximately 6 months post-vaccination. ILI was defined as at least one respiratory symptom (e.g., cough, sore throat, nasal congestion) and at least one systemic symptom (e.g., oral temperature of 100.0ºF or higher, feverishness, chills, body aches). Nasal and throat swabs were collected from subjects who presented with an ILI for laboratory confirmation by viral culture and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Influenza virus strain was further characterized using gene sequencing and pyrosequencing.</p><p>Attack rates and vaccine efficacy, defined as the relative reduction in the influenza infection rate for AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) compared to placebo, were calculated using the per protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza infection due to influenza A or B virus strains contained in the vaccine was 60% with a lower limit of the 95% CI of 41% (Table 6).</p><p class="First Footnote">Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> NCT00562484</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">b</span> The Per Protocol Population was identical to the Evaluable Population in this study.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">c</span> Vaccine efficacy = 1 minus the ratio of AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) /placebo infection rates. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that the lower limit of the CI for vaccine efficacy was greater than 40%.</p><h3>Immunogenicity of Afluria Quadrivalent in Adults and Older Adults Administered by Needle and Syringe</h3><p class="First">Study 1 was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in the U.S. in adults aged 18 years of age and older. Subjects received one dose of either Afluria Quadrivalent (N=1691) or one of two formulations of comparator trivalent influenza vaccine (AFLURIA, TIV-1 N=854 or TIV-2 N=850) each containing an influenza type B virus that corresponded to one of the two B viruses in Afluria Quadrivalent (a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage or a type B virus of the Victoria lineage, respectively).</p><p>Post-vaccination immunogenicity was evaluated on sera obtained 21 days after administration of a single dose of Afluria Quadrivalent or TIV comparator. The co-primary endpoints were HI Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) ratios (adjusted for baseline HI titers) and the difference in seroconversion rates for each vaccine strain, 21 days after vaccination. Pre-specified non-inferiority criteria required that the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio (TIV/Afluria Quadrivalent) did not exceed 1.5 and the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the seroconversion rate difference (TIV minus Afluria Quadrivalent) did not exceed 10.0% for each strain.</p><p>Serum HI antibody responses to Afluria Quadrivalent were non-inferior to both TIVs for all influenza strains for subjects 18 years of age and older. Additionally, non-inferiority was demonstrated for both endpoints in both age sub-groups, adults aged 18 through 64 years and 65 years and older, for all strains (Table 7). Superiority of the immune response to each of the influenza B strains contained in Afluria Quadrivalent was shown relative to the antibody response after vaccination with TIV formulations not containing that B lineage strain for subjects 18 years of age and older. Superiority against the alternate B strain was also demonstrated for each of the influenza B strains in both age sub-groups; 18 through 64 years and 65 years and older. Post-hoc analyses of immunogenicity endpoints by gender did not demonstrate meaningful differences between males and females. The study population was not sufficiently diverse to assess differences between races or ethnicities.</p><p class="First Footnote">Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; GMT, geometric mean titer.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> NCT02214225</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">b</span> GMT ratio was computed after fitting a multi-variable model on the post-vaccination titers including sex, vaccination history, pre-vaccination HI titers and other factors.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">c</span> Seroconversion rate is defined as a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI antibody titer from pre-vaccination titer <span class="Bold">≥</span> 1:10 or an increase in titer from &lt; 1:10 to ≥ 1:40.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">d</span> Non-inferiority (NI) criterion for the GMT ratio: upper bound of 2-sided 95% CI on the GMT ratio of Pooled TIV or TIV-1 (B Yamagata) or TIV-2 (B Victoria)/Afluria Quadrivalent should not exceed 1.5.

This study compared the immune response following administration of AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) when delivered intramuscularly using either the PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System or needle and syringe. Immunogenicity assessments were performed prior to vaccination and at 28 days after vaccination in the immunogenicity population (1130 subjects, 562 PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System group, 568 needle and syringe group). The co-primary endpoints were HI GMT ratios for each vaccine strain and the absolute difference in seroconversion rates for each vaccine strain 28 days after vaccination. As shown in Table 8, non-inferiority of administration of AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) by the PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System compared to administration of AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) by needle and syringe was demonstrated in the immunogenicity population for all strains. Post-hoc analyses of immunogenicity by age showed that younger subjects (18 through 49 years) elicited higher immunological responses than older subjects (50 through 64 years). Post-hoc analyses of immunogenicity according to sex and body mass index did not reveal significant influences of these variables on immune responses. The study population was not sufficiently diverse to assess immunogenicity by race or ethnicity.</p><p class="First Footnote">Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; GMT, geometric mean titer.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> NCT01688921</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">b</span> GMT ratio is defined as post-vaccination GMT for Needle and Syringe/PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">c</span> Seroconversion rate is defined as a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI antibody titer from pre-vaccination titer <span class="Bold">≥</span> 1:10 or an increase in titer from &lt; 1:10 to ≥ 1:40.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">d</span> Non-inferiority (NI) criterion for the GMT ratio: upper bound of 2-sided 95% CI on the GMT ratio of Needle and Syringe/PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System should not exceed 1.5.

Subjects 5 through 8 years of age were eligible to receive a second dose at least 28 days after the first dose depending on their influenza vaccination history, consistent with the 2015-2016 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines. Approximately 25% of subjects in each treatment group in the 5 through 8 years of age sub-group received two vaccine doses.</p><p>Baseline serology for HI assessment was collected prior to vaccination.
