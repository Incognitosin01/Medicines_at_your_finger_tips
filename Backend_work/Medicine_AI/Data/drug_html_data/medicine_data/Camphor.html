Although toxicity most often results from oral ingestion of topical or inhalation products, combined dermal and inhalation exposure has resulted in toxicity (Love 2004).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Liquid for steam inhalation: Self-medication (OTC use): For steam inhalation only. Use with caution in patients with persistent or chronic cough (eg, cough due to smoking, emphysema, or asthma) or a productive cough. Do not heat the product in a microwave or use near an open flame, direct the steam from the vaporizer too close to the face, or ingest the product. Do not add the product to hot water or any container where heating water (except when adding to cold water only in a hot steam vaporizer); may cause splattering and result in burns. Discontinue use and contact a healthcare provider if the cough lasts more than 7 days, recurs, or is accompanied by a fever, rash, or persistent headache.</p><p>• Topical cream: Self-medication (OTC use): Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Discontinue use and contact a healthcare provider if the condition worsens, symptoms persist for more than 7 days, symptoms recur, or if redness develops.</p><p>• Topical gel: Self-medication (OTC use): Avoid contact with eyes. Discontinue use and contact a healthcare provider if the condition worsens, symptoms persist for more than 7 days, or if symptoms recur.</p><p><b><i>Special handling:</i></b></p><p>• Flammability: Camphor is flammable; keep away from fire or flame.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Accidental ingestion: In case of accidental ingestion, seek medical help or contact a poison control center immediately.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Following exposure to large concentrations (eg, oral ingestion observed with poisonings), camphor crosses the placenta and is toxic to the fetus (Rabl 1997).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p><b>All skin products:</b></p><p>• It is used to relieve itching and pain from insect bites or skin irritation.</p><p><b>Liquid for breathing in:</b></p><p>• It is used to relieve coughing.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
