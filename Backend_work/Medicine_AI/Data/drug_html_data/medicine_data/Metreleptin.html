Lipodystrophy (LIP-oh-DIS-tro-fee) is a problem with the way the body stores fat.</p><p>Metreleptin is <b>not</b> for use in people who are obese or have lipodystrophy caused by HIV or AIDS.</p><p>Metreleptin is available only under a special program. You must be registered in the program and understand the risks and benefits of  metreleptin.</p><p>Metreleptin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>In some people, metreleptin can trigger an immune response to the medicine, making it less effective or causing certain side effects. Call your doctor if you develop any signs of a new infection (fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, swollen glands, flu symptoms), or worsening of your lipodystrophy symptoms. If you are diabetic, tell your doctor if you have any changes in your blood sugar levels.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use metreleptin if you are allergic to it. <b>Metreleptin is not for use in treating obesity that is unrelated to leptin deficiency.</b></p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a blood cell disorder, or low white blood cell (WBC) counts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>liver disease (including "fatty liver");</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>diabetes (especially if you use insulin or oral diabetes medicine);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pancreatitis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other metabolic disorder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or psoriasis;</p>
</li>
<li>

Having lipodystrophy may increase complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, high birth weight, diabetes, or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating lipodystrophy may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using  metreleptin. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><h2>How should I use metreleptin?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Metreleptin is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider will teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself. Metreleptin should not be injected into a muscle or vein.</p><p>Metreleptin is usually given once daily at any time of day, with or without food.</p><p>Metreleptin doses are based on weight (especially in children and teenagers). Your dose needs may change if you gain or lose weight.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Metreleptin must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. When using injections by yourself, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine. Do not mix metreleptin with other medicines in the same vial or syringe.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine looks cloudy, has changed colors, or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p><b>When preparing a metreleptin dose for an infant:</b> Do not use a diluent called Bacteriostatic Water for Injection (BWFI). BWFI contains an ingredient that can cause serious side effects or death in very young infants or premature babies. <b>Use only Sterile Water for Injection (WFI) or the diluent that your doctor or pharmacist has recommended.</b></p><p>Store unmixed metreleptin vials in their original container in the refrigerator. Protect from light. Do not freeze. <b>Do not use the medicine if the powder in the vial has changed colors, or if the expiration date on the label has passed.</b></p><p><b>Metreleptin mixed with BWFI must be used within 3 days. Store the mixture in the refrigerator.</b></p><p>Metreleptin mixed with WFI must be used right away. WFI contains no preservative. Do not save for later use.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Low blood sugar (<b>hypoglycemia</b>) can occur during treatment with metreleptin, especially if you also use insulin or oral diabetes medicine. Ask your doctor how to best treat low blood sugar. If you are diabetic, check your blood sugar carefully while using metreleptin.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you remember, and then go back to your regular injection schedule. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. Overdose may cause loss of appetite and weight loss.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using metreleptin?</h2><p>If you use insulin, do not inject metreleptin into the same skin area where your insulin has been injected.</p><p>Do not stop using metreleptin suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Metreleptin side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficult breathing; rapid heart rate, feeling like you might pass out; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>In some people, metreleptin can trigger an immune response to the medicine, making it less effective or causing certain side effects.
