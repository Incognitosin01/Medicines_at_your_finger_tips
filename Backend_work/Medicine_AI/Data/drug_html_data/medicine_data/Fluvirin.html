</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Fluvirin</h2><p class="First">Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is an inactivated influenza virus vaccine indicated for immunization of persons 4 years of age and older against influenza virus disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and type B contained in the vaccine. [see DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS (3)]</p><p>Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is not indicated for children less than 4 years of age because there is evidence of diminished immune response in this age group.</p><h2>Fluvirin Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Preparation for Administration</h3><p class="First">Inspect Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> syringes and multidose vials visually for particulate matter and/or discoloration prior to administration. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered.</p><p>Shake the syringe vigorously before administering the vaccine and shake the multidose vial preparation each time before withdrawing a dose of vaccine.</p><p>Between uses, return the multidose vial to the recommended storage conditions between 2º and 8ºC (36º and 46ºF). <span class="Bold">Do not freeze.</span> Discard if the vaccine has been frozen.</p><p>A separate syringe and needle or a sterile disposable unit should be used for each injection to prevent transmission of infectious agents from one person to another. Needles should be disposed of properly and not recapped.</p><p><span class="Bold">It is recommended that small syringes (0.5-mL or 1-mL) should be used to minimize any product loss.</span></p><h3>Recommended Dose and Schedule</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Children (4 to 17 years of age):</span></p><p>Children aged 4 to 8 years should receive 2 doses of vaccine if they have not been vaccinated previously at any time with any influenza virus vaccine. Children aged 4 to 8 years who received only 1 dose in their first year of vaccination in the previous season should receive 2 doses. Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> should be given as a 0.5-mL intramuscular injection on day 1 followed by another 0.5-mL intramuscular injection at least 4 weeks later. 2 doses are required for protection in these children. (15.3)</p><p>Children aged 4 to 8 years who have been vaccinated with two doses of any influenza virus vaccine in the previous season, or with one dose in the year prior to the previous season, should receive only one dose. (15.3)</p><p>Children aged 9 years and older should receive a single 0.5-mL intramuscular injection.</p><p>The needle size may range from 7/8 to 1¼ inches, depending on the size of the child's deltoid muscle, and should be of sufficient length to penetrate the muscle tissue. The anterolateral thigh can be used, but the needle should be longer, usually 1 inch.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults (18 years and older):</span></p><p>Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered as a single 0.5-mL intramuscular injection preferably in the region of the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p><p>The vaccine should not be injected in the gluteal region or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk. A needle of ≥1 inch is preferred because needles &lt;1 inch might be of insufficient length to penetrate muscle tissue in certain adults.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is a sterile suspension for intramuscular injection. Each 0.5-mL dose contains 15 mcg hemagglutinin from each of the following 3 influenza virus types: A/California/7/2009, NYMC X-181 (H1N1); A/Victoria/210/2009, NYMC X-187 (H3N2) (an A/Perth/16/2009-like virus); and B/Brisbane/60/2008. [see DESCRIPTION (11)]</p><p>Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is available in two presentations:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> should not be administered to anyone with known systemic hypersensitivity reactions to egg proteins (eggs or egg products), or to any component of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>, or who has had a life-threatening reaction to previous influenza vaccinations.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h3><p class="First">If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.</p><h3>Altered Immunocompetence</h3><p class="First">If Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is administered to immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained.</p><h3>Preventing and Managing Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Prior to administration of any dose of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>, the healthcare provider should review the patient's prior immunization history for possible adverse events, to determine the existence of any contraindication to immunization with Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> and to allow an assessment of benefits and risks. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine.</p><p>The tip caps of the Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals.</p><h3>Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness</h3><p class="First">Vaccination with Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> may not protect all individuals.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Overall Adverse Reaction Profile</h3><p class="First">Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been observed in individuals receiving Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> during postmarketing surveillance.</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Adverse event information from clinical trials provides a basis for identifying adverse events that appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximating the rates of these events. However, because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine, and may not reflect rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adult and Geriatric Subjects</span></p><p>Safety data were collected in a total of 2768 adult and geriatric subjects (18 years of age and older) who have received Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> in 29 clinical studies since 1982.</p><p>In 9 clinical studies since 1997, among 1261 recipients of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>, 745 (59%) were women; 1211 (96%) were White, 23 (2%) Asian, 15 (1%) Black and 12 (1%) other; 370 (29%) of subjects were elderly (≥65 years of age). All studies have been conducted in the UK, apart from a study run in the US in 2005-2006 where Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> was used as a comparator for an unlicensed vaccine.</p><p>After vaccination, the subjects were observed for 30 minutes for hypersensitivity or other immediate reactions. Subjects were instructed to complete a diary card for three days following immunization (i.e. Day 1 to 4) to collect local and systemic reactions (see Tables 1 and 2). All local and systemic adverse events were considered to be at least possibly related to the vaccine. Local and systemic reactions mostly began between day 1 and day 2. The overall adverse events reported in clinical trials since 1998 in at least 5% of the subjects are summarized in Table 3.</p><p class="First Footnote">Results reported to the nearest whole percent; Fever defined as &gt;38°C</p><p class="First Footnote">– not reported</p><p class="First Footnote">* Solicited adverse events in the first 72 hours after administration of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span></p><p class="First Footnote">§ Solicited adverse events reported by COSTART preferred term</p><p class="First Footnote">^ Solicited adverse events reported by MEDDRA preferred term</p><p class="First Footnote">Results reported to the nearest whole percent</p><p class="First Footnote">– not reported</p><p class="First Footnote">Results reported to the nearest whole percent; Fever defined as &gt;38°C</p><p class="First Footnote">– not reaching the cut-off of 5%</p><p class="First Footnote">§ Solicited adverse events reported by COSTART preferred term</p><p class="First Footnote">^ Solicited adverse events reported by MEDDRA preferred term</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults (18 to 64 years of age)</span></p><p>In adult subjects, solicited local adverse events occurred with similar frequency in all trials. The most common solicited adverse events occurring in the first 96 hours after administration (Tables 1 and 2) were associated with the injection site (such as pain, erythema, mass, induration and swelling) but were generally mild/moderate and transient. The most common solicited systemic adverse events were headache and myalgia.</p><p>The most common overall events in adult subjects (18-64 years of age) were headache, fatigue, injection site reactions (pain, mass, erythema, and induration) and malaise (Table 3).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Subjects (65 years of age and older)</span></p><p>In geriatric subjects, solicited local and systemic adverse events occurred less frequently than in adult subjects. The most common solicited local and systemic adverse events were injection site pain, and headache (Tables 1 and 2). All were considered mild/moderate and were transient.</p><p>The most common overall events in elderly subjects (≥65 years of age) were headache and fatigue.</p><p>Only 11 serious adverse events in adult and geriatric subjects (18 years and older) have been reported to date from all the trials performed. These serious adverse events were a minor stroke experienced by a 67 year old subject 14 days after vaccination (1990), death of an 82 year old subject 35 days after vaccination (1990) in very early studies; death of a 72 year old subject 19 days after vaccination (1998-1999), a hospitalization for hemorrhoidectomy of a 38 year old male subject (1999-2000), a severe respiratory tract infection experienced by a 74 year old subject 12 days after vaccination (2002-2003), a planned transurethral resection of the prostate in a subject with prior history of prostatism (2004-2005), two cases of influenza (2005-2006), a drug overdose (2005-2006), cholelithiasis (2005-2006) and a nasal septal operation (2005-2006). None of these events were considered causally related to vaccination.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects</span></p><p>In 1987 a clinical study was carried out in 38 ‘at risk' children aged between 4 and 12 years (17 females and 21 males). To record the safety of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>, participants recorded their symptoms on a diary card during the three days after vaccination and noted any further symptoms they thought were attributable to the vaccine. The only reactions recorded were tenderness at the site of vaccination in 21% of the participants on day 1, which was still present in 16% on day 2 and 5% on day 3. In one child, the tenderness was also accompanied by redness at the site of injection for two days. The reactions were not age-dependent and there was no bias towards the younger children.</p><p>Three clinical studies were carried out between 1995 and 2004 in a total of 520 pediatric subjects (age range 6 - 47 months). Of these, 285 healthy subjects plus 41 ‘at risk' subjects received FLUVIRN<span class="Sup">®</span>. No serious adverse events were reported.</p><p>Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> should only be used for the immunization of persons aged 4 years and over.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Adverse events described here are included because: a) they represent reactions which are known to occur following immunizations generally or influenza immunizations specifically; b) they are potentially serious; or c) the frequency of reporting.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Italics">Body as a whole</span>: Local injection site reactions (including pain, pain limiting limb movement, redness, swelling, warmth, ecchymosis, induration), hot flashes/flushes; chills; fever; malaise; shivering; fatigue; asthenia; facial edema.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders:</span> Hypersensitivity reactions (including throat and/or mouth edema). In rare cases, hypersensitivity reactions have lead to anaphylactic shock and death.</li>

</ul><h3>Other Adverse Reactions Associated with Influenza Vaccination</h3><p class="First">Anaphylaxis has been reported after administration of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>. Although Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> contains only a limited quantity of egg protein, this protein can induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons who have severe egg allergy. Allergic reactions include hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, and systemic anaphylaxis [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].</p><p>The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Evidence for a causal relation of GBS with subsequent vaccines prepared from other influenza viruses is unclear. If influenza vaccine does pose a risk, it is probably slightly more than 1 additional case/1 million persons vaccinated.</p><p>Neurological disorders temporally associated with influenza vaccination such as encephalopathy, optic neuritis/neuropathy, partial facial paralysis, and brachial plexus neuropathy have been reported.</p><p>Microscopic polyangiitis (vasculitis) has been reported temporally associated with influenza vaccination.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Concomitant Administration with Other Vaccines</h3><p class="First">There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> with other vaccines. If Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine(s), the vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites.</p><p>Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> should not be mixed with any other vaccine in the same syringe or vial.</p><h3>Concurrent Use with Immunosuppressive Therapies</h3><p class="First">Immunosuppressive therapies, including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses), may reduce the immune response to Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>. It is also not known whether Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and immunogenicity of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> have not been established in children under 4 years of age.</p><p>The safety and immunogenicity of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> have been established in the age group 4 years to 16 years. The use of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> in adults that demonstrate the immunogenicity of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) and CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Since 1997, of the total number of geriatric subjects (n = 397) in clinical studies of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>, 29% were 65 years and over, while 2.1% were 75 years and over.</p><p>Antibody responses were lower in the geriatric population than in younger subjects. Adverse events occurred less frequently in geriatric subjects (≥65 years) than in younger adults. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. [See ADVERSE REACTION (6) and CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].</p><h2>Fluvirin Description</h2><p class="First">Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is a trivalent, sub-unit (purified surface antigen) influenza virus vaccine prepared from virus propagated in the allantoic cavity of embryonated hens' eggs inoculated with a specific type of influenza virus suspension containing neomycin and polymyxin. Each of the influenza virus strains is harvested and clarified separately by centrifugation and filtration prior to inactivation with betapropiolactone. The inactivated virus is concentrated and purified by zonal centrifugation. The surface antigens, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are obtained from the influenza virus particle by further centrifugation in the presence of nonylphenol ethoxylate, a process which removes most of the internal proteins. The nonylphenol ethoxylate is removed from the surface antigen preparation.</p><p>Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> is a homogenized, sterile, slightly opalescent suspension in a phosphate buffered saline. Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> has been standardized according to USPHS requirements for the 2010-2011 influenza season and is formulated to contain 45 mcg hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5-mL dose in the recommended ratio of 15 mcg HA of each of the following 3 viruses:</p><p>A/California/7/2009, NYMC X-181 (H1N1); A/Victoria/210/2009, NYMC X-187 (H3N2) (an A/Perth/16/2009-like virus); and B/Brisbane/60/2008.</p><p>The 0.5-mL prefilled syringe presentation is formulated without preservative. However, thimerosal, a mercury derivative used during manufacturing, is removed by subsequent purification steps to a trace amount (≤ 1 mcg mercury per 0.5-mL dose).</p><p>The 5-mL multidose vial formulation contains thimerosal, a mercury derivative, added as a preservative. Each 0.5-mL dose from the multidose vial contains 25 mcg mercury.</p><p>Each dose from the multidose vial or from the prefilled syringe may also contain residual amounts of egg proteins (≤ 1 mcg ovalbumin), polymyxin (≤ 3.75 mcg), neomycin (≤ 2.5 mcg), betapropiolactone (not more than 0.5 mcg) and nonylphenol ethoxylate (not more than 0.015% w/v).</p><p>The tip caps of the Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex. The multidose vial stopper and the syringe stopper/plunger do not contain latex.</p><h2>Fluvirin - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Influenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. For example, since 1977, antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Specific levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers post-vaccination with inactivated influenza virus vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza illness. In some human studies, antibody titer of ≥1:40 have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects [see REFERENCES (15.1, 15.2)].</p><p>Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual change of one or more new strains in each year's influenza vaccine. Therefore, inactivated influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the hemagglutinin of strains (i.e., typically two type A and one type B), representing the influenza viruses likely to be circulating in the United States in the upcoming winter.</p><p>Annual revaccination with the current vaccine is recommended because immunity declines during the year after vaccination, and because circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year [see REFERENCES (15.3)].</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Between 1982 and 1991, twelve clinical studies were conducted in healthy adult and geriatric subjects and one in children between 4 and 12 years of age who were considered to be ‘at risk'. Since 1991 an annual clinical study has been conducted in the UK in healthy adults aged 18 years or older. Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> was also used as a control in a US clinical trial in adults (18-49 years of age). In all the trials, blood samples were taken prior to vaccination and approximately three weeks after vaccination to assess the immunogenic response to vaccination by measurement of anti-HA antibodies.</p><p>Three clinical studies were carried out between 1995 and 2004 in a total of 520 pediatric subjects (age range 6-47 months). Of these, 285 healthy subjects plus 41 ‘at risk' pediatric subjects received Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p><p>Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> should only be used for the immunization of persons aged 4 years and over.</p><h3>Immunogenicity in Adults (18 to 64 years of age)</h3><p class="First">Tables 4 and 5 show the immunogenicity data for the adult age group. The seven clinical studies presented enrolled a total of 774 adult subjects. In the adult group, for all antigens (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B) at least one of the following point estimate criteria was met: the proportion of subjects with seroconversion (post-vaccination titer ≥1:40 from a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10) or significant increase (at least a four-fold increase from pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10) in antibody titer was greater than 40%; the geometric mean titer (GMT) increase was &gt;2.5; the proportion of subjects with a post-vaccination hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer ≥1:40 was greater than 70%.</p><p class="First Footnote">∞ Seroconversion: proportion of subjects with either a post-vaccination HI titer ≥1:40 from a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 or at least a four-fold increase from pre-vaccination HI titer ≥1:10 in antibody titer.</p><p class="First Footnote">¥ HI titer ≥1:40: proportion of subjects with a post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40.</p><p class="First Footnote">φ 95% CI: 95% confidence interval</p><p class="First Footnote">* 95% CI: 95% confidence interval</p><h3>Immunogenicity in Geriatric Subjects (65 years of age and older)</h3><p class="First">Tables 6 and 7 show the immunogenicity of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span> in the geriatric age group.

Thirty-eight participants aged between 4 and 12 years of age were assessed. Ten subjects had diabetes, 21 had asthma, two had both diabetes and asthma, and one had lymphoid leukemia. There were four healthy control subjects. All participants received a single 0.5-mL dose of Fluvirin<span class="Sup">®</span>.</p><p>Immunogenicity results were obtained for 19 of the 38 subjects enrolled in the study. The point estimate of the percentage of subjects achieving a titer of ≥ 1:40 was 84% for the A/H1N1 strain 79% for the B strain, and 53% for the A/H3N2 strain. The GMT fold increases were 5.8 for the A/H1N1 strain, 40 for the B strain and 17.7 for the A/H3N2 strain.</p><p>Three clinical studies were carried out between 1995 and 2004 in a total of 520 pediatric subjects (age range 6-47 months).
