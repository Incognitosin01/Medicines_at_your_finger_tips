To administer Novoeight through incompatible needleless connectors, withdraw the reconstituted product into a standard 10 mL sterile Luer-lock plastic syringe.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Novoeight is available as a white lyophilized powder in single-use vials containing 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 international units per vial.</p><p>After reconstitution with 4 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution, each mL of reconstituted solution contains approximately 62.5, 125, 250, 375, 500 or 750 international units of Novoeight, respectively<span class="Bold">.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Novoeight is contraindicated in patients who have had life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to Novoeight or its components (including traces of hamster proteins).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with Novoeight. Novoeight contains trace amounts of hamster proteins. Patients treated with this product may develop hypersensitivity to these non-human mammalian proteins. Early signs of hypersensitivity reactions that can progress to anaphylaxis include angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, wheezing, urticaria, and pruritus. Immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate treatment if allergic- or anaphylactic-type reactions occur.</p><h3>Neutralizing Antibodies</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII can occur following administration of Novoeight. Previously untreated patients (PUPs) are at greatest risk for inhibitor development with all factor VIII products. Inhibitors have been reported following administration of Novoeight in PUPs [<span class="Italics">see</span></span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions <span class="following_xmChange">(</span>6.1<span class="following_xmChange">)]</span></span><span class="following_xmChange">. Monitor all patients for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observation and laboratory testing. If the expected plasma levels of factor VIII activity are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, perform testing for factor VIII inhibitors.</span></p><h3>Monitoring Laboratory Tests</h3><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most frequently reported adverse reactions observed in clinical trials (≥ 1%) were injection site reactions, and pyrexia.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>During the clinical development of Novoeight, 301 male patients (242 previously treated patients (PTPs); exposed to a factor VIII-containing product for ≥150 days and 59 Previously Untreated Patients (PUPs)) with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII level ≤1%) received at least one dose of Novoeight as part of either routine prophylaxis, on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes, perioperative management of major and minor surgical, dental, or other invasive procedures, Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) or pharmacokinetic evaluation of Novoeight with more than 140,000 exposure days (corresponding to over 900 patient years). During prophylaxis treatment subjects received a median of 468 injections of Novoeight (range 1-1317).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Summary of Adverse Reactions (ARs ) with a Frequency ≥ 1% in 301 Subjects</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>Subjects were monitored for neutralizing antibodies to factor VIII and binding antibodies to CHO and murine protein. No PTPs developed confirmed neutralizing antibodies to factor VIII. One twenty-two month old previously treated child had a positive neutralizing antibody to factor VIII of 1.3 [BU] in the Bethesda assay after 15 exposure days that was not confirmed when checked after 20 exposure days. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> recovery was normal for this child and no clinical adverse findings were observed. In the completed main phase of the clinical trial in PUPs, 24 of 56 (42.9%) patients developed inhibitors with a mean of 14.1 exposure days at the time of the first positive inhibitor test; 15 (26.8%) PUPs developed high titer (≥ 5 BU) inhibitors. High risk genetic mutations were identified in 91.7% of the overall inhibitors and 93.3% of the high titer inhibitors.</p><p>No patients developed <span class="Italics">de novo</span> anti-murine antibodies. Nineteen subjects were positive for anti-Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell protein antibodies. Two of these subjects changed from anti-CHO negative to anti-CHO positive and 6 subjects changed from anti-CHO positive to anti-CHO negative. The remaining 11 subjects were either positive throughout the trials (n=6), negative at baseline and end-of trial but with transient positive samples (n=2), or positive at baseline and end-of trial but with negative samples in between (n=3). No clinical adverse findings were observed in any of these subjects.</p><p>The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, it may be misleading to compare the incidence of antibodies to Novoeight with the incidence of antibodies to other products.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Adverse reactions reported during post marketing period were similar in nature to those observed during clinical trials.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>As hemophilia mainly affects males, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies using Novoeight in pregnant women to determine whether there is a drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Novoeight.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. There is no reliable data on the incidences specific to the hemophilia A population.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of Novoeight in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, and the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Novoeight and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Novoeight or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Children have shorter half-life and lower recovery of factor VIII than adults. Because clearance (based on per kg body weight) has been demonstrated to be higher in the pediatric population, higher or more frequent dosing based on body weight may be needed. [<span class="Italics">See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]</p><p>Safety and efficacy studies have been performed in 146 pediatric patients &lt;18 years of age. Ninety (including all 59 PUPs) of these subjects (62%) were &lt;6 years of age, 32 (22%) were 6 to &lt;12 years of age, and 24 (16%) were adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years of age). Subjects during routine prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds received Novoeight at the dose levels described in Tables 1 and 3. A total of 1290 bleeds in 127 subjects were treated with Novoeight. The majority of the bleeds 1162 (90%) were of mild/moderate severity. Of these 1290 bleeds, 1140 (88%) were rated excellent or good in their response to treatment with Novoeightand in 17 (1%) the response to treatment was unknown. A total of 1100 (85%) of the bleeds were resolved with one or two injections of Novoeight. Routine prophylactic treatment has been shown to reduce joint bleeding<span class="Italics">.</span> <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14)]</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Novoeight did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.</p><h3>Obesity</h3><p class="First">In the extension trial, in six adult patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, the AUC was higher and clearance lower than in patients with BMI &lt; 30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.

Novoeight is available in single-dose vials that contain nominally 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 or 3000 international units (IU) per vial. When reconstituted with the appropriate volume of diluent, the product contains the following components per mL: 18 mg sodium chloride, 1.5 mg L-histidine, 3 mg sucrose, 0.1 mg polysorbate 80, 0.055 mg L-methionine and 0.25 mg calcium chloride dihydrate. The product contains no preservative. Each vial of Novoeight is labeled with the actual rFVIII activity expressed in IU determined by the one-stage clotting assay, using a reference material calibrated against a World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for FVIII Concentrates. One IU, as defined by the WHO standard for human FVIII, is approximately equal to the level of FVIII activity in 1 mL of fresh pooled human plasma. The specific activity of Novoeight is approximately 8340 IU per milligram of protein.</p><p>The active ingredient in Novoeight is a recombinant (r) analogue of human coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) with a molecular mass of 166 kDa, calculated excluding post-translational modifications. The rFVIII molecule in Novoeight is a glycoprotein containing a heavy chain and a light chain, with 21 of the 908 amino acids of the B-domain of endogenous FVIII connected to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. Once activated, the resulting rFVIIIa has a comparable structure to the endogenous FVIIIa.</p><p>Novoeight is synthesized by a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line which secretes rFVIII into the cell culture medium. The rFVIII protein is purified using a series of chromatography steps, one of which is the use of an immunoaffinity column in which a monoclonal antibody, produced in CHO cells and directed against FVIII, is employed to selectively isolate the rFVIII from the medium. The production process includes two dedicated viral clearance steps - a detergent treatment step for inactivation and a 20-nm filtration step for removal of viruses. No additives of human or animal origin are used in the cell culture, purification and formulation of Novoeight.</p><h2>Novoeight - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Novoeight temporarily replaces the missing clotting factor VIII that is needed for effective hemostasis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged in patients with hemophilia A. Determination of aPTT is a conventional <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assay for the biological activity of FVIII. Treatment with Novoeight normalizes the aPTT over the effective dosing period.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">All pharmacokinetic studies with Novoeight were conducted in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII ≤ 1%). Analysis of plasma samples was conducted using both the one-stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay.</p><p>In a multi-center, multi-national, open-label, single dose pharmacokinetic study, 23 patients with severe hemophilia A received 50 international units/kg of Novoeight intravenously. Two patients were below the age of 18 years (13 and 17 years). The pharmacokinetic parameters for 20 patients who completed the study are summarized in Table 5.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5: Pharmacokinetics of Novoeight in 20 adult and adolescent patients with hemophilia A<span class="Sup">a</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Parameters</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clotting Assay</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Chromogenic Assay</span></p><p class="First">Mean (SD)</p><p class="First">Mean (SD)</p><p class="First">Incremental Recovery (IU/mL)/(IU/kg)</p><p class="First">0.020 (0.002)</p><p class="First">0.028 (0.006)</p><p class="First">AUC (IU*h/mL)</p><p class="First">14.2 (3.8)</p><p class="First">18.7 (5.1)</p><p class="First">CL (mL/h/kg)</p><p class="First">3.74 (0.95)</p><p class="First">2.87 (0.80)</p><p class="First">t½ (h)</p><p class="First">10.8 (4.9)</p><p class="First">12.0 ( 9.3)</p><p class="First">Vss (mL/kg)</p><p class="First">53.4 (10.9)</p><p class="First">44.3 (28.2)</p><p class="First">C<span class="Sub">max</span> (IU/mL)</p><p class="First">1.07 (0.16)</p><p class="First">1.54 (0.29)</p><p class="First">MRT (h)</p><p class="First">15.4 (6.4)</p><p class="First">16.4 (10.1)</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span>Dose: 50 IU/kg turoctocog alfa (single i.v. dose)</p><p>In a single dose PK assessment in adult patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> in the extension trial <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14)],</span> the AUC was 59% higher and clearance was 33% lower in 6 subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> compared to subjects with normal BMI, see Table 6.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 6: Pharmacokinetics of Novoeight in 6 adult patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2a</span></span></p><p class="First">BMI (kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>)</p><p class="First">33.35 (2.367)</p><p>Range 30.5 – 37.2</p><p class="First">Incremental Recovery (IU/mL)/(IU/kg)</p><p class="First">0.024 (0.01)</p><p class="First">0.035 (0.01)</p><p class="First">AUC (IU*h/mL)</p><p class="First">22.64 (5.74)</p><p class="First">31.02 (9.78)</p><p class="First">CL (mL/h/kg)</p><p class="First">2.49 (0.77)</p><p class="First">1.94 (0.95)</p><p class="First">t<span class="Sub">½</span> (h)</p><p class="First">12.80 (2.99)</p><p class="First">12.40 (3.16)</p><p class="First">Vss (mL/kg)</p><p class="First">39.67 (10.03)</p><p class="First">29.79 (7.87)</p><p class="First">Cmax (IU/mL)</p><p class="First">1.49 (0.36)</p><p class="First">2.03 (0.51)</p><p class="First">MRT (h)</p><p class="First">16.84 (4.78)</p><p class="First">16.58 (4.26)</p><p><span class="Sup">a</span>Dose: 50 IU/kg turoctocog alfa (single i.v. dose)</p><p>In a separate pharmacokinetic study, 28 pediatric patients with severe hemophilia A (14 patients were below 6 years of age and 14 patients were between 6 to &lt;12 years of age) received a single dose of 50 international units/kg Novoeight.

An assessment of the carcinogenic potential of Novoeight was completed, and no carcinogenic risk from product use has been identified.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Four multi-center, open-label, non-controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Novoeightin the on-demand treatment and control of breakthrough bleeds, routine prophylaxis and perioperative management in patients with hemophilia A. Three of these trials were performed in PTPs (two trials and one extension trial) and the fourth in PUPs. The analysis included 297 exposed subjects: 175 previously treated adolescents or adult subjects from the age of 12 years (≥150 exposure days), 63 previously treated pediatric subjects below the age of 12 years (≥50 exposure days) and 59 PUPs below 6 years of age. Immunocompetent patients with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII activity ≤1%) and no history of FVIII inhibitors were eligible for the trials. Subjects during routine prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds received Novoeight at the dose levels described in Tables 1 and 3. Breakthrough bleeds were treated at the investigator’s discretion aiming for a FVIII activity level above 0.5 IU/mL. Treatment during surgery was at the investigator’s discretion aiming for a FVIII trough activity level above 0.5 IU/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">On-demand Treatment and Control of Bleeding Episodes</span></p><p>A total of 3153 bleeds in 260 subjects were treated with Novoeight. The majority of the bleeds (90%) were of mild/moderate severity, 54% of the bleeds were spontaneous and 67% of the bleeds were localized in joints.</p><p>An overall assessment of efficacy was performed by the subject (for home treatment) or study site investigator (for treatment under medical supervision) using a four-point scale of excellent, good, moderate, or none. If the hemostatic response was rated as “excellent” or “good”, the treatment of the bleed was considered a success. If the hemostatic response was rated as “moderate or none” the treatment was considered a failure. Of these 3,153 bleeds, 2,809 (89%) were rated excellent or good in their response to treatment with Novoeight,274 (9%) were rated as moderate, 25 (0.8%) were rated as having no response and for 45 (1%) the response to treatment was unknown.

Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder that prevents blood from clotting normally.</p><p>Novoeight is used to control and prevent bleeding in people with hemophilia A.</p><p>Your healthcare provider may give you Novoeight when you have surgery.</p><p>Novoeight is not used to treat von Willebrand Disease.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Who should not use Novoeight?</span></span></p><p>You should not use Novoeight if you</p><p>Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or nursing because Novoeight might not be right for you.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">What should I tell my healthcare provider before I use Novoeight?</span></span></p><p>You should tell your healthcare provider if you</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">How should I use Novoeight?</span></span></p><p>Treatment with Novoeight should be started by a healthcare provider who is experienced in the care of patients with hemophilia A.</p><p>Novoeight is given as an injection into the vein.</p><p>You may infuse Novoeight at a hemophilia treatment center, at your healthcare provider's office or in your home. You should be trained on how to do infusions by your hemophilia treatment center or healthcare provider. Many people with hemophilia A learn to infuse the medicine by themselves or with the help of a family member.</p><p>Your healthcare provider will tell you how much Novoeight to use based on your weight, the severity of your hemophilia A, and where you are bleeding.</p><p>You may need to have blood tests done after getting Novoeight to be sure that your blood level of factor VIII is high enough to clot your blood. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.</p><p>Your healthcare provider will calculate your dose of Novoeight (in international units, IU) depending on your condition and body weight.</p><p><span class="Bold">Call your healthcare provider right away if your bleeding does not stop after taking Novoeight.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Development of factor VIII inhibitors</span></p><p>Your body can also make antibodies called “inhibitors” against Novoeight, which may stop Novoeight from working properly.</p><p>If your bleeding is not adequately controlled, it could be due to the development of factor VIII inhibitors. This should be checked by your healthcare provider. You might need a higher dose of Novoeight or even a different product to control bleeding. Do not increase the total dose of Novoeight to control your bleeding without consulting your healthcare provider.</p><p><span class="Bold">Use in children</span></p><p>Novoeight can be used in children. Your healthcare provider will decide the dose of Novoeight you will receive.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">If you forget to use Novoeight</span></span></p><p>Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
