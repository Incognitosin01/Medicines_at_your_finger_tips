Administer additional doses if the fibrinogen concentration falls below 80 mg/dL for minor bleeding and below 130 mg/dL for major bleeding until hemostasis is achieved.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Fibryga: Prior to reconstitution, warm both powder and sterile water for injection to room temperature; if water bath is used for warming, the water bath should not exceed 37°C (98°F). Reconstitute with 50 mL of SWFI; gently swirl until dissolved (~5 to 10 minutes), do not shake.</p><p>RiaSTAP: Transfer 50 mL of SWFI into fibrinogen concentrate vial. Gently swirl until dissolved; do not shake. Filter reconstituted solution with a 17-micron filter (not supplied) into an appropriate syringe before administration. Solution should be colorless and clear to slightly opalescent; discard if cloudy or contains particulates.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p><b>IV:</b> For IV administration only; infuse at a rate not exceeding 5 mL/minute. Solution should be infused at room temperature. Do not administer with other products or IV solutions. Administration should be completed within 8 hours (RiaSTAP) or 4 hours (Fibryga) after reconstitution. For RiaSTAP, filter reconstituted solution with a 17-micron filter (not supplied) into an appropriate syringe before administration.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Fibryga: Store intact vials at 2°C to 25°C (36°F to 77°F) in original carton; do not freeze. Protect from light. Discard partially used vials. Reconstituted solution should be used within 4 hours; do not refrigerate or freeze.</p><p>RiaSTAP: As of May 2019, the manufacturer recommends storing intact vials at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) (prior recommendation was to store at 2°C to 25°C [36°F to 77°F]) in original carton; do not freeze. Protect from light. Discard partially used vials. Reconstituted solution is stable for 8 hours when stored at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Headache (&gt;1%)</p><p>Dermatologic: Erythema (≤8%), pruritus (≤8%)</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Vomiting (&gt;5%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Weakness (&gt;5%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (&gt;5%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Anaphylaxis, arterial thrombosis, chills, deep vein thrombosis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity reaction, myocardial infarction, nausea, pulmonary embolism, skin rash, thromboembolism</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, hives, generalized urticaria, chest tightness, wheezing, hypotension, anaphylaxis) may occur. In the event of hypersensitivity reactions, treatment should be discontinued immediately.</p><p>• Thrombotic events: Thrombosis may occur spontaneously in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency with or without fibrinogen replacement therapy. Thromboembolic events have been reported in patients receiving fibrinogen concentrate. Consider potential risk of thrombosis with use; monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents which could transmit disease (eg, viruses and theoretically the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD]). Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Not indicated for the treatment of dysfibrinogenemia.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Fibrinogen level; signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity and thrombosis</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency may have an increased risk of bleeding, thrombosis, and pregnancy loss; replacement therapy may be initiated prior to conception (RCOG [Pavord 2017]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Pregnant patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency may have an increased risk of bleeding, thrombosis, and pregnancy loss; therefore, close surveillance is recommended. Maternal fibrinogen concentrations increase during pregnancy but do not protect against potential complications. Prophylaxis throughout pregnancy may be needed and higher doses may be required as pregnancy progresses. Plasma derived fibrinogen concentrate may be used for treatment or prevention of bleeding in patients with severe deficiency (RCOG [Pavord 2017]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to stop bleeding.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
