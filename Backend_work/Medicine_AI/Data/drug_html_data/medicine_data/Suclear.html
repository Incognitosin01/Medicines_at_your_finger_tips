</ul><p>The Suclear brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Suclear</h2><p class="First">Suclear is indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults.</p><h2>Suclear Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosing Overview</h3><p class="First">There are two dosing regimens. Each requires two separate dosing times:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Split-Dose (2-Day) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span></li>
<li>Day-Before (1-Day) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p>Both Suclear dosing regimens require administration of Suclear using one 6-oz bottle of oral solution (containing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate) diluted with water to 16-oz, followed by a 2-L jug of powder (polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride) dissolved in water. Additional fluids must be consumed in both dosing regimens <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]</span>. Instruct patients to consume only clear liquids (no solid food or milk) and to avoid alcohol on the day before colonoscopy until after completion of the colonoscopy. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Split-Dose (2-Day) Regimen (Preferred Method)</h3><p class="First">The Split-Dose regimen is the preferred dosing method. Instruct patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids, as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">Dose 1 - Evening before the colonoscopy (10 to 12 hours prior to Dose 2)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dose 2 - Next morning on the day of the colonoscopy (start at least 3 ½ hours prior to colonoscopy)</span></p><h3>Day-Before (1-Day) Regimen (Alternative Method)</h3><p class="First">The Day-Before regimen is the alternative dosing method for patients for whom the Split-Dosing regimen is inappropriate. Instruct patients to take two separate doses in conjunction with fluids as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">On the evening before the colonoscopy:</span></p><p>Dose 1 (Begin at least 3 ½ hours prior to bedtime)</p><p>Dose 2 (Approximately 2 hours after starting Dose 1)</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oral solution: One 6-oz bottle of oral solution containing 17.5 g of sodium sulfate, 3.13 g of potassium sulfate, and 1.6 g of magnesium sulfate.</p><p>For oral solution: One 2-L bottle with powder for solution containing 210 g of polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG-3350), 5.6 g of sodium chloride, 2.86 g of sodium bicarbonate and 0.74 g of potassium chloride. An optional 1 g flavoring ingredient may be added.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Suclear is contraindicated in patients with the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Gastrointestinal obstruction or ileus</li>
<li>Bowel perforation</li>
<li>Gastric retention</li>
<li>Toxic colitis or toxic megacolon</li>
<li>Known allergies to any components of Suclear [<span class="Italics">see Description (11)</span>]</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of Suclear. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking Suclear, perform post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment.</p><p>Patients with electrolyte abnormalities should have them corrected before treatment with Suclear. Consider the risks of prescribing Suclear in patients with certain medical conditions that predispose them (or who are using medications that increase the risk of) fluid and electrolyte disturbances or that may increase the risk of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment. Use of alcohol may increase the risk of dehydration.</p><h3>Cardiac Arrhythmias</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Carefully consider the risks of prescribing Suclear for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality.</p><p>Consider the risks of prescribing Suclear in patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Consider the risks of prescribing Suclear in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before and after the use of Suclear. Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests in these patients (e.g., electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN).</p><h3>Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis</h3><p class="First">Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Suclear may increase these risks. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease</h3><p class="First">If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Suclear.</p><p>Patients with severe active ulcerative colitis may be at increased risk of exacerbation of their disease with Suclear.</p><h3>Use in Patients at Risk of Aspiration and Regurgitation</h3><p class="First">Patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during administration of Suclear solution.</p><h3>Not for Direct Ingestion</h3><p class="First">Direct ingestion of the undiluted solution may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration or other serious adverse reactions. Each bottle must be diluted with water to the recommended final volume.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>In randomized, multicenter, controlled clinical trials, the effectiveness of Suclear for colon cleansing was compared with two separate preparations containing two liters of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes (Studies 1 and 2) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span> Suclear and the comparator preparation were administered entirely the day before the colonoscopy in Study 1, whereas they were administered as split doses in Study 2. In addition to collection of spontaneously reported adverse reactions, patients were instructed to complete a symptom scale questionnaire that targeted expected adverse reactions (overall discomfort, stomach cramping, stomach bloating, and nausea). Patients also were asked separately to report vomiting episodes.</p><p>Table 1 presents the most common adverse reactions in Study 1 and Study 2.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">#</span>Include spontaneously reported adverse reactions as well as those reported in a symptom scale questionnaire.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">*</span>Abdominal pain also included reports of upper abdominal pain and abdominal tenderness.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">†</span></span>Comparator 1: PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution; and two bisacodyl 5-mg delayed-release tablets.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">‡</span></span>Comparator 2: PEG-3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid for oral solution.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Electrolyte Abnormalities</span></p><p>Table 2 presents the incidence of new laboratory abnormalities in Study 1 and Study 2.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">†</span></span>Comparator 1: PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution; and two bisacodyl 5-mg delayed-release tablets.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">‡</span></span>Comparator 2: PEG-3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid for oral solution.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">*</span>Anion gap was calculated using the following formula: [Sodium (mEq/L)] - [Chloride (mEq/L)] + [Bicarbonate (mEq/L)].

This includes patients receiving drugs which may be associated with hypokalemia (such as diuretics or corticosteroids, or drugs where hypokalemia is a particular risk, such as cardiac glycosides) or hyponatremia. Use caution when Suclear is used in patients on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) or drugs known to induce Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, antipsychotic drugs and carbamazepine, as these drugs may increase the risk of water retention and/or electrolyte imbalance. Consider additional patient evaluations as appropriate [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5)</span>].</p><h3>Potential for Altered Drug Absorption</h3><p class="First">Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of each Suclear dose may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the medication may not be absorbed properly.</p><h3>Stimulant Laxatives</h3><p class="First">Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and Suclear may increase the risk of mucosal ulceration or ischemic colitis. Avoid use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate) while taking Suclear.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C.</p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Suclear. It is not known whether Suclear can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Suclear should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Suclear is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Suclear in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 362 patients who received Suclear in clinical trials, 90 (25%) were 65 years of age or older, and 29 (8%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The safety of Suclear in patients with renal impairment has not been adequately evaluated. Due to increased risk for electrolyte abnormalities in this population and a potential for reduced clearance of drugs in this setting, consider the risks of using Suclear in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Suclear Description</h2><p class="First">Suclear (sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate; and PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride) is an osmotic laxative that includes one 6-oz bottle of oral solution and one 2-L bottle of powder for oral solution.</p><p>The 6-oz bottle of oral solution contains 17.5 g of sodium sulfate, 3.13 g of potassium sulfate, and 1.6 g of magnesium sulfate. Inactive ingredients include sodium benzoate, NF, sucralose, malic acid, FCC, citric acid, USP, flavoring ingredients and purified water, USP. The solution is a clear to slightly hazy liquid. The solution is clear and colorless when diluted to a final volume of 16-oz with water. Each kit also contains a 16-oz mixing container.</p><p>The 2-L bottle contains a white powder for oral solution containing 210 g of PEG 3350, NF, 5.6 g of sodium chloride, USP, 2.86 g of sodium bicarbonate, USP and 0.74 g of potassium chloride, USP. Inactive ingredients include 1 g of an optional flavor ingredient. Flavor packs are available in Cherry, Lemon-Lime, Orange and Pineapple. The preparation can be used with or without the addition of a flavor pack. When dissolved in water to a volume of 2 L, the solution is isosmotic, clear and colorless.</p><h2>Suclear - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The primary mode of action of Suclear is the osmotic effect of the unabsorbed polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sulfate salts. Sulfate salts provide sulfate anions, which are poorly absorbed. The osmotic effect of unabsorbed sulfate anions and the associated cations causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>PEG is also a largely unabsorbed osmotic agent which causes water to be retained within the gastrointestinal tract.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The osmotic effect of the unabsorbed PEG or sulfate ions, when ingested, produces a copious watery diarrhea.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Oral sulfates</span>: Following oral administration of oral sulfate solution, approximately 20% of dose undergoes systemic absorption, with the remainder of the dose excreted in feces. Renal elimination appears to be the predominant route of clearance for absorbed sulfate. After administration of Suclear (only the 6-oz bottle of sulfate salts) to six healthy volunteers, the time at which serum sulfate reached its highest point (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was approximately 5.5 hours after the first dose of sulfates. Serum sulfate levels declined with a half-life of 8.5 hours.</p><p class="First">PEG3350: The pharmacokinetics of PEG3350 following administration of Suclear were not assessed. Available pharmacokinetic information for oral PEG3350 suggests that it is poorly absorbed, primarily excreted in feces, and, to the extent it is absorbed it is eliminated in urine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetic Studies in Patients with Hepatic Impairment or Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The disposition of sulfate after ingestion of one 6-oz bottle of the Suclear sulfate solution was studied in patients (N=6) with mild-moderate hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh grades A (n = 5) and B (n = 1)] and in patients (N=6) with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min). Following administration of one 6-oz dose of sulfates, the renal impairment group had the highest serum sulfate levels, followed by the hepatic impairment group, and then by healthy subjects. Renal impairment resulted in 43% higher mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> than healthy subjects. Urinary excretion of sulfate over 30 hours in subjects who received two 6-oz doses of sulfates was similar between hepatic patients and normal volunteers, but was approximately 16% lower in moderate renal impairment patients than in healthy volunteers. The mean sulfate levels of all three groups returned to their respective baseline levels by Day 6 after dose initiation.</p><p>PK for PEG3350 at the recommended dose was not assessed in patients with organ impairment.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Suclear. Studies to evaluate the possible impairment of fertility or mutagenic potential of Suclear have not been performed.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">The sulfate salts of sodium, potassium, and magnesium contained in Suclear were administered orally (gavage) to rats and dogs up to 28 days up to a maximum daily dose of 5 g/kg/day (approximately 1.8 and 6 times for rats and dogs, respectively, the recommended human dose of 22 g/day or 0.44 g/kg based on the body surface area). In rats, the sulfate salts caused diarrhea and electrolyte and metabolic changes, including hypochloremia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, lower serum osmolality, and high serum bicarbonate. Significant renal changes included increased fractional sodium excretion, increased urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and alkaline urine in both males and females. In addition, creatinine clearance was significantly decreased in females at the highest dose. No microscopic renal changes were seen. In dogs, the sulfate salts caused emesis, excessive salivation, excessive drinking of water, abnormal excreta (soft and/or mucoid feces and/or diarrhea) and increased urine pH and sodium excretion.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The colon cleansing efficacy of Suclear was evaluated in two randomized, single-blind (colonoscopist only), active-controlled, multicenter studies (Studies 1 and 2) in patients scheduled to undergo an elective colonoscopy. A total of 737 adult patients were included in the efficacy analysis: 366 from Study 1 and 371 from Study 2. Patients ranged in age from 21 to 86 years (mean age 57 years), and 54% were female. Self-identified race distribution was as follows: 82% White, 10% Black, and 8% other.</p><p>Patients randomized to Suclear in the two studies were treated with one of two dosing regimens:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>In Study 1, Suclear was given by “Day-Before” (evening before) dosing, where both doses were taken sequentially on the day before the colonoscopy, with the first dose taken at approximately 6:00 PM, followed by one 16-oz container (provided with the kit) of water, and the second dose taken 2 hours after starting the first dose. Patients were recommended to drink at least one additional 16-oz container of water on the evening prior to colonoscopy.<br/>
<br/>
The comparator for Study 1 was a preparation containing two liters of PEG plus electrolytes (sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium chloride) for oral solution and two 5-mg bisacodyl tablets, administered the day before the procedure. All patients in both the Suclear and comparator group were limited to a clear liquid diet on the day before the procedure until after completion of the colonoscopy.<br/></li>
<li>In Study 2, Suclear was given by “Split-Dose” (evening before and day of) dosing, where the first dose was taken the evening before the colonoscopy (at approximately 6:00 PM), followed by one 16-oz container of water (with a recommendation to drink at least one additional 16-oz container of water on the evening prior to colonoscopy), and the second dose was taken the morning of the colonoscopy (at approximately 6:00 AM). The second dose had to be completed at least 2 hours prior to colonoscopy. Patients in the Suclear group were limited to a clear liquid diet on the day before the procedure until after completion of the colonoscopy.<br/>
<br/>
The comparator for Study 2 was a preparation containing two liters of PEG plus electrolytes (sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid) for oral solution, administered as split doses. Patients receiving Suclear were limited to a clear liquid diet on the day before the procedure until completion of the colonoscopy. Patients receiving the comparator were allowed to have a normal breakfast, a light lunch, clear soup and/or plain yogurt for dinner the day prior to colonoscopy. They were limited to a clear liquid diet from the time the preparation was started until after completion of the colonoscopy.</li>
</ul><p>The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing as assessed by the colonoscopists, who were not informed about the type of preparation received. Successful colon cleansing was defined as bowel preparations that were graded excellent (no more than small bits of adherent feces/fluid) or good (small amounts of feces or fluid not interfering with the exam) by the colonoscopist. Failed colon cleansing was defined as bowel preparations that were graded fair (enough feces or fluid to prevent a completely reliable exam) or poor (large amounts of fecal residue, additional cleansing required). The proportion of patients with successful colon cleansing was numerically similar between treatment groups for both studies. See Tables 3 and 4.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">†</span></span>Successful colon cleansing was defined as excellent (no more than small bits of adherent feces/fluid) or good (small amounts of feces or fluid not interfering with the exam) by the blinded colonoscopist.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">‡</span></span>Comparator 1: PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution; and two bisacodyl 5-mg delayed-release tablets.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">†</span></span>Successful colon cleansing was defined as excellent (no more than small bits of adherent feces/fluid) or good (small amounts of feces or fluid not interfering with the exam) by the blinded colonoscopist.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">‡</span></span>Comparator 2: PEG-3350, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid for oral solution.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Suclear          NDC 52268-901-01</span></p><p>Each Suclear kit contains:</p><ul class="Disc">
