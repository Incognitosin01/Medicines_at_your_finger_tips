Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported.</p><h3>Mode of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not been proven.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ketoconazole Cream</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Cream, 2% is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea pedis caused by <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes</span> and <span class="Italics">Epidermophyton floccosum;</span> in the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by <span class="Italics">Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare);</span> in the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis caused by <span class="Italics">Candida spp.</span> and in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Cream, 2% is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to the active or excipient ingredients of this formulation.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Cream, 2% is not for ophthalmic use.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' <span class="Italics">salmonella</span> microsomal activator assay was also negative.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">During clinical trials 45 (5.0%) of 905 patients treated with Ketoconazole Cream, 2% and 5 (2.4%) of 208 patients treated with placebo reported side effects consisting mainly of severe irritation, pruritus and stinging. One of the patients treated with Ketoconazole Cream developed a painful allergic reaction.</p><p>In worldwide postmarketing experience, rare reports of contact dermatitis have been associated with Ketoconazole Cream or one of its excipients, namely propylene glycol.</p><h2>Ketoconazole Cream Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor</h3><p class="First">It is recommended that Ketoconazole Cream, 2% be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence.</p><p>Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment.</p><h3>Seborrheic dermatitis</h3><p class="First">Ketoconazole Cream, 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until clinical clearing.</p><p>If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined.</p><h2>How is Ketoconazole Cream Supplied</h2><p class="First">Ketoconazole Cream, 2% is supplied in 15 g (NDC 16714-955-01), 30 g (NDC 16714-955-02), and 60 g (NDC 16714-955-03) tubes.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F)</span> [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p class="First">Manufactured for: Northstar RxLLC, Memphis, TN 38141.<br/>
