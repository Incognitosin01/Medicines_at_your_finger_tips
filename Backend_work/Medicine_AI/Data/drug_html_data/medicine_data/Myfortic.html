Your body may "reject" an organ transplant when the immune system treats the new organ as an invader and attacks it. An immunosuppressant helps to prevent this rejection.</p><p>Myfortic is used with other medicines to prevent organ rejection after a kidney transplant.</p><p>Myfortic is usually given with cyclosporine and a corticosteroid medicine.</p><p>Myfortic is for use in adults and children at least 5 years old.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Myfortic can cause a miscarriage or birth defects when used during pregnancy.</b> Both men and women should use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy during and shortly after treatment with mycophenolic acid.</p><p><b>Myfortic is sometimes given to pregnant women.</b> Although this medicine can affect pregnancy or fertility, it is sometimes given to women who are unable to use other needed transplant medications.</p><p>Using Myfortic may increase your risk of cancer, serious infections, or kidney transplant failure.</p><p><b>Call your doctor right away if you have symptoms such as:</b> fever, swollen glands, weight loss, vomiting or diarrhea, painful urination, a new skin lesion, any change in your mental state, weakness on one side of your body, or pain near your transplanted kidney.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Myfortic side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Myfortic</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Myfortic may cause a serious brain infection that can lead to disability or death.
