It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, ceftaroline will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.</p><p>Ceftaroline is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ceftaroline</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ceftaroline, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ceftaroline or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ceftaroline injection to treat ABSSSI in children at least 34 weeks gestational age and 12 days and older, and to treat CABP in children 2 months of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than these age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ceftaroline injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving ceftaroline injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.
