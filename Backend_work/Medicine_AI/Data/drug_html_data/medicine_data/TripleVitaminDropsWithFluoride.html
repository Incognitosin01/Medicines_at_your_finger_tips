</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">See INDICATIONS AND USAGE section for use by children 6 months to 6 years of age.</p><p>This product does not contain the essential vitamin folic acid.</p><p><span class="Bold">Active ingredient for caries prophylaxis:</span> Fluoride as sodium fluoride. Does not contain folic acid.</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Ingredients:</span> Caramel color, cherry flavor, glycerin, methylparaben, polysorbate 80, purified water, sodium benzoate and sodium hydroxide.</p><h2>Triple Vitamin Drops With Fluoride - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, fluorapatite.</p><p>The reaction may be expressed by the equation:<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>Ca<span class="Sub">10</span>(PO<span class="Sub">4</span>)<span class="Sub">6</span>(OH)<span class="Sub">2</span> + 2F-  Ca<span class="Sub">10</span>(PO<span class="Sub">4</span>)<span class="Sub">6</span>F<span class="Sub">2</span> + 2OH-</p><p>(Hydroxyapatite)           (Fluorapatite)</p><p>Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Supplementation of the diet with vitamins A, C and D.</p><p>Triple-Vitamin Fluoride Drops 0.25 mg also provide fluoride for caries prophylaxis.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that infants and young children 6 months to 3 years of age, in areas where drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride, and children 3-6 years of age, in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride, receive 0.25 mg of supplemental fluoride daily which is provided in a full dose (1 mL) of Triple-Vitamin Fluoride 0.25 mg drops. (see Dosage and Administration).</p><p>Triple-Vitamin Fluoride 0.25 mg drops supply significant amounts of vitamins A, C and D to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain essential vitamins and fluoride.</p><h2>WARNINGS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">As in the case of all medications, keep out of reach of children.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride.</p><p>When prescribing vitamin fluoride products:</p><p>Triple-Vitamin and Fluoride Drops 0.25 mg should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50 mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.)</p><p>Important Considerations When Using Dosage Schedule:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>If fluoride level is unknown, drinking water should be tested for fluoride content before supplements are prescribed. For testing of fluoride content, contact the local or state health department.</li>
<li>All sources of fluoride should be evaluated with a thorough fluoride history.</li>
<li>Patient exposure to multiple water sources can make proper prescribing complex.</li>
<li>Ingestion of higher than recommended levels of fluoride by children has been associated with an increase in mild dental fluorosis in developing, unerupted teeth.</li>
<li>Fluoride supplements require long-term compliance on a daily basis.</li>
</ul><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">See following chart. May be dropped directly into mouth with dropper; or mixed with cereal, fruit juice or other food.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">Triple-Vitamin and Fluoride 0.25 mg drops is available in 50 mL bottles with accompanying calibrated dropper.</p><h3>RECOMMENDED STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F), excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (between 59°F and 86°F). After opening, store away from direct light. Close tightly after each use. Occasional deepening of color has no significant effect on vitamin potency.</p><p>REFRIGERATION IS NOT REQUIRED.</p><p><span class="Bold">SHAKE WELL</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">Manufactured for:<br/>
