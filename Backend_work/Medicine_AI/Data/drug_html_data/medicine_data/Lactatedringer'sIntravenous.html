It is also used as an alkalinizing agent, which increases the pH level of the body.</p><p>Lactated ringer's is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using lactated ringer's</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For lactated ringer's, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to lactated ringer's or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Lactated Ringer's injection have not been performed in the pediatric population. However, pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lactated ringer's in children are not expected. Recommended doses should not be exceeded, and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Lactated Ringer's injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have electrolyte imbalance and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving lactated ringer's.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
