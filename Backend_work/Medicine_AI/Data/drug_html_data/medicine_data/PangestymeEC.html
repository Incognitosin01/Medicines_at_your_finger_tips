Pancrelipase contains the enzymes (including lipases, proteases, and amylases) needed for the digestion of proteins, starches, and fats.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Pangestyme EC</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Creon®</i>, <i>Pancreaze®</i>, <i>Pertzye®</i>, and <i>Zenpep®</i> in children.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Ultresa™</i> in children younger than 12 months of age, and <i>Viokace™</i> in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Creon®</i>, <i>Pancreaze®</i>, and <i>Pertzye®</i> in geriatric patients.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Ultresa™</i>, <i>Viokace™</i>, and <i>Zenpep®</i> in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving these medicines.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Abnormal blood glucose levels, history of or</li>
<li>Fibrosing colonopathy (bowel disorder) or</li>
<li>Gout or</li>
<li>Hyperuricemia (high uric acid in the blood) or</li>

<li>Intestinal (bowel) blockage, history of or</li>
<li>Kidney disease or</li>
<li>Pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Allergy to pork products—Use with caution. Pancrelipase contains pork proteins.</li>

It may not be specific to Pangestyme EC. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>This medicine comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor about anything you do not understand.</p><p>Take this medicine with meals or snacks and enough liquid to swallow it completely, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</p><p>When prescribing this medicine for your condition, your doctor may also prescribe a personal diet for you. <i>Follow the special diet carefully</i>. This is necessary for the medicine to work properly. It is also important to drink plenty of water while you are on this medicine.</p><p>For patients taking the <i>tablets</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Viokace™ tablet is used in combination with certain medicines for stomach ulcer called proton pump inhibitors (eg, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, Nexium®, Prevacid®, Prilosec®).</li>
<li>Swallow the tablets quickly with some liquid, without chewing, to avoid mouth irritation.</li>
</ul><p>For patients taking the <i>delayed-release capsules</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Swallow the capsule whole.</li>
<li>Do not crush, break, or chew before swallowing. Do not hold the capsule in your mouth.</li>
<li>When given to adults or children who can not swallow the capsule, the capsule may be opened and sprinkled on a small amount (about 10 mL or less) of soft food with a pH of 4.5 or less that can be swallowed without chewing, such as applesauce. This mixture must be swallowed immediately and followed with a glass of water or juice. This will ensure complete swallowing of the contents of the capsule and avoid mouth irritation.</li>
<li>When given to infants, the contents of the capsule may be put directly into the infant's mouth or mixed with a small amount (about 10 mL or less) of soft acidic food with a pH of 4.5 or less, including applesauce, pureed bananas, or pears, followed by 120 mL of formula or breastfeeding. Do not mix the contents of the capsule directly to alkaline foods, such as milk, breast milk, formula, or ice cream. This could reduce the effect of the medicine.</li>
<li>Pertzye® capsules may also be given through a gastrostomy tube with a diameter of 14 French or larger.
<ul>
<li>Mix the contents of the capsule with soft foods (including applesauce).</li>
<li>Remove the plunger and carefully spoon the mixture into the syringe. Replace the plunger partially back.</li>
<li>Connect the syringe into the tube feeding port and inject the medicine for 10 to 12 seconds.</li>
<li>Flush the tube with 10 mL of water to rinse all of the medicine into the stomach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Throw away any unused portions of the mixture. Do not save for later use.</li>
