It is used in patients with kidney disease who are receiving dialysis and a medicine called epoetin to prevent anemia. Sodium ferric gluconate complex is an iron replacement product.</p><p>Iron is a mineral that the body needs to produce red blood cells. When the body does not get enough iron, the number of red blood cells is lower than normal. This condition is called iron deficiency (iron shortage) or iron deficiency anemia.</p><p>This medicine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Nulecit</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
