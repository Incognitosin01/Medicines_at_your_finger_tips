</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Aspirin and Dipyridamole Capsules</h2><p class="First">Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients who have had transient ischemia of the brain or completed ischemic stroke due to thrombosis.</p><h2>Aspirin and Dipyridamole Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets.</span></p><p>The recommended dose of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is one capsule given orally twice daily, one in the morning and one in the evening. Swallow capsules whole without chewing. Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole can be administered with or without food.</p><h3>Alternative Regimen in Case of Intolerable Headaches</h3><p class="First">In the event of intolerable headaches during initial treatment, switch to one capsule at bedtime and low-dose aspirin in the morning. Because there are no outcome data with this regimen and headaches become less of a problem as treatment continues, patients should return to the usual regimen as soon as possible, usually within one week.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">25 mg/200 mg: Two-piece hard gelatin capsule with a Swedish orange opaque cap and white opaque body, imprinted in black ink with TEVA over 3064 on the cap and TEVA over 3064 on the body.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the product components.</p><h3>Allergy</h3><p class="First">Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) products and in patients with the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Aspirin may cause severe urticaria, angioedema or bronchospasm.</p><h3>Reye Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Do not use aspirin in children or teenagers with viral infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Risk of Bleeding</h3><p class="First">Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Intracranial Hemorrhage</span></p><p>In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects</span></p><p>GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur.</p><p>In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups.</p><p><span class="Italics">Peptic Ulcer Disease</span></p><p>Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding.</p><p><span class="Italics">Alcohol Warning</span></p><p>Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin.</p><h3>Renal Failure</h3><p class="First">Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.<br/></p><h3>Hepatic Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Coronary Artery Disease</h3><p class="First">Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole.</p><p>For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications.</p><h3>Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension.</p><h3>Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Intake of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test.</span></p><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes.</p><p>This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole with placebo, extended- release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization.</p><p>Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole.</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> Hypothermia, chest pain, allergic reaction, syncope</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Angina pectoris, hypotension</p><p><span class="Italics">Central Nervous System:</span> Cerebral edema, dizziness, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage</p><p><span class="Italics">Fluid and Electrolyte:</span> Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hypokalemia</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> Pancreatitis, Reye syndrome, hematemesis, gastritis, ulceration and perforation, hemorrhage rectum, melena, GI hemorrhage</p><p><span class="Italics">Hearing and Vestibular Disorders:</span> Hearing loss</p><p><span class="Italics">Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders:</span> Tachycardia, palpitation</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune System Disorders:</span> Hypersensitivity, acute anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema</p><p><span class="Italics">Liver and Biliary System Disorders:</span> Hepatitis, hepatic failure, cholelithiasis, jaundice, hepatic function abnormal</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> Rhabdomyolysis, myalgia</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders:</span> Hypoglycemia, dehydration</p><p><span class="Italics">Platelet, Bleeding and Clotting Disorders:</span> Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hematoma,</p><p>gingival bleeding, epistaxis, purpura</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> Confusion, agitation</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> Tachypnea, dyspnea, hemoptysis</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages Disorders:</span> Rash, alopecia, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, skin hemorrhages such as bruising, ecchymosis, and hematoma, pruritus, urticaria</p><p><span class="Italics">Urogenital:</span> Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and failure, hematuria</p><p><span class="Italics">Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders:</span> Allergic vasculitis, flushing</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">Other Adverse Events:</span> Anorexia, aplastic anemia, migraine, pancytopenia, thrombocytosis.</span></p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From Literature</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson)</span></p><p>Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine.

Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole contains low-dose aspirin which is an NSAID <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspirin in rats and rabbits at doses about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole in mice, rabbits, and rats have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole.

However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspirin-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats (spina bifida, exencephaly, microphthalmia and coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis, about 66 and 44 times, respectively, the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspirin-dipyridamole. Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspirin/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspirin, the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspirin on the breastfed infant and no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspirin daily. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspirin. Aspirin was undetectable in human milk. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in pediatric patients have not been studied. Because of the aspirin component, use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2, 61% were 65 and over, while 27% were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction</h3><p class="First">Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Avoid using aspirin containing products, such as aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal (glomerular filtration rate &lt;10 mL/min) dysfunction <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin, overdosage of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose. In case of real or suspected overdose, seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Careful medical management is essential.</p><p>Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole, symptoms such as warm feeling, flushes, sweating, restlessness, feeling of weakness, and dizziness may occur. A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed.</p><p>Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 mcg/mL. In severe cases, hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 mcg/mL are clearly toxic. Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 mcg/mL. A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g.</p><p>Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions, increasing drug elimination, and correcting acid-base disturbances. Consider gastric emptying and/or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vomited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. Follow acid-base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance. Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis. Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia.</p><p>Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole overdose. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose; however, since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole. Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children.</p><h2>Aspirin and Dipyridamole Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Aspirin and Extended-Release Dipyridamole Capsules are a combination antiplatelet agent intended for oral administration.

This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP).</p><p>Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'‑guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide).</p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin</span></p><p>Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A<span class="Sub">2</span>, a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole.

The peak plasma concentration at steady-state is 1.98 mcg/mL (1.01 to 3.99 mcg/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 0.53 mcg/mL (0.18 to 1.01 mcg/mL).</p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin:</span></p><p>Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0.63 hours (0.5 to 1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (given as 25 mg BID).

Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall, with 50% to 75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Food</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Dipyridamole</span></p><p>When aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20 to 30% compared to fasting.

The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin</span></p><p>Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (&lt;100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Dipyridamole</span></p><p>Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma, about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half-life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase λ<span class="Sub">z</span> with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole which was 13.6 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin</span></p><p>Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid, with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 to 2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 2 hours) after administration of aspirin. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10 to 20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours.</p><p>The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first-order kinetics with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole and has a half-life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2 to 3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from &lt;5% to &gt;80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Patients</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Dipyridamole</span></p><p>In ESPS2 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>, plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (&gt;65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Dysfunction</span></span> <span class="Bold"><br/></span> No study has been conducted with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole in patients with hepatic dysfunction.</p><p><span class="Italics">Dipyridamole</span><br/>
