</ul><h2>Lamivudine Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Lamivudine Oral Solution in HIV-1-infected adults is 300 mg daily, administered as either 150 mg taken orally twice daily or 300 mg taken orally once daily with or without food. If lamivudine is administered to a patient infected with HIV-1 and HBV, the dosage indicated for HIV-1 therapy should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h3>Recommended Dosage for Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Lamivudine scored tablet is the preferred formulation for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients who weigh at least 14 kg and for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate. Before prescribing lamivudine scored tablets, pediatric patients should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. For patients unable to safely and reliably swallow lamivudine tablets, the oral solution formulation may be prescribed <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.

Dosage adjustments are listed in Table 2 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>No additional dosing of lamivudine is required after routine (4-hour) hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>Although there are insufficient data to recommend a specific dose adjustment of lamivudine in pediatric patients with renal impairment, a reduction in the dose and/or an increase in the dosing interval should be considered.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lamivudine Oral Solution USP</span> is a clear, colorless to pale yellow, strawberry-banana flavored liquid, contains 10 mg of lamivudine per 1 mL.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Lamivudine Oral Solution is contraindicated in patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to lamivudine.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Patients with Hepatitis B Virus Co-infection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis</span></p><p>Clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of lamivudine. These exacerbations have been detected primarily by serum ALT elevations in addition to re-emergence of HBV DNA. Although most events appear to have been self-limited, fatalities have been reported in some cases. Similar events have been reported from postmarketing experience after changes from lamivudine-containing HIV-1 treatment regimens to non-lamivudine-containing regimens in patients infected with both HIV-1 and HBV. The causal relationship to discontinuation of lamivudine treatment is unknown. Patients should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Important Differences among Lamivudine-Containing Products</span></p><p>Lamivudine Oral Solution contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient (lamivudine) than EPIVIR-HBV tablets and EPIVIR-HBV oral solution. EPIVIR-HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B. The formulation and dosage of lamivudine in EPIVIR-HBV are not appropriate for patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If treatment with EPIVIR-HBV is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV-1 infection, rapid emergence of HIV-1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV-1 treatment. If a decision is made to administer lamivudine to patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, lamivudine tablets, Lamivudine Oral Solution, or another product containing the higher dose of lamivudine should be used as part of an appropriate combination regimen.</p><p><span class="Bold">Emergence of Lamivudine-Resistant HBV</span></p><p>Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in subjects dually infected with HIV-1 and HBV (see full prescribing information for EPIVIR-HBV). Emergence of hepatitis B virus variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has also been reported in HIV-1-infected subjects who have received lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with hepatitis B virus.</p><h3>Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis</h3><p class="First">Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including lamivudine. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure, a history of pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis, lamivudine should be used with caution. Treatment with lamivudine should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Lower Virologic Suppression Rates and Increased Risk of Viral Resistance with Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Pediatric subjects who received Lamivudine Oral Solution  (at weight band-based doses approximating 8 mg per kg per day) concomitantly with other antiretroviral oral solutions at any time in the ARROW trial had lower rates of virologic suppression, lower plasma lamivudine exposure, and developed viral resistance more frequently than those receiving lamivudine tablets <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Microbiology (12.4), Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Lamivudine scored tablet is the preferred formulation for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients who weigh at least 14 kg and for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate. An all-tablet regimen should be used when possible to avoid a potential interaction with sorbitol <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Consider more frequent monitoring of HIV-1 viral load when treating with Lamivudine Oral Solution.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

In an open-label dose-escalation trial (NUCA2002), 14 subjects (14%) developed pancreatitis while receiving monotherapy with lamivudine. Three of these subjects died of complications of pancreatitis. In a second open-label trial (NUCA2005), 12 subjects (18%) developed pancreatitis. In Trial ACTG300, pancreatitis was not observed in 236 subjects randomized to lamivudine plus RETROVIR. Pancreatitis was observed in 1 subject in this trial who received open-label lamivudine in combination with RETROVIR and ritonavir following discontinuation of didanosine monotherapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies:</span><span class="Bold"> </span> Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300.</p><p>Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Italics">Pediatric Subjects Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677):</span> The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of lamivudine was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.<span class="Bold"> <br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Neonates: </span> Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of <span class="Italics">in utero</span> and infant lamivudine exposure are not known.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lamivudine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to lamivudine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Body as a Whole</span></p><p>Redistribution/accumulation of body fat.</p><p><span class="Bold">Endocrine and Metabolic</span></p><p>Hyperglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>Weakness.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hemic and Lymphatic</span></p><p>Anemia (including pure red cell aplasia and severe anemias progressing on therapy).</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic and Pancreatic</span></p><p>Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>, posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis B <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity</span></p><p>Anaphylaxis, urticaria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal</span></p><p>Muscle weakness, CPK elevation, rhabdomyolysis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin</span></p><p>Alopecia, pruritus.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs Inhibiting Organic Cation Transporters</h3><p class="First">Lamivudine is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system (e.g., trimethoprim) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of lamivudine.</p><h3>Sorbitol</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose-dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures. When possible, avoid use of sorbitol-containing medicines with lamivudine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to lamivudine during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from the APR show no difference in the overall risk of birth defects for lamivudine compared with the background rate for birth defects of 2.7% in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) reference population <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. The APR uses the MACDP as the U.S. reference population for birth defects in the general population. The MACDP evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks’ gestation. The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR. The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U.S. general population is 15% to 20%. The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality at systemic exposure (AUC) similar to the recommended clinical dose; however, no adverse development effects were observed with oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rats during organogenesis at plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) 35 times the recommended clinical dose <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data:</span> Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 11,000 exposures to lamivudine during pregnancy resulting in live births (including over 4,500 exposed in the first trimester), there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for lamivudine compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the MACDP. The prevalence of defects in live births was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.6% to 3.6%) following first trimester exposure to lamivudine-containing regimens and 2.8% (95% CI: 2.5% to 3.3%) following second/third trimester exposure to lamivudine-containing regimens.</p><p>Lamivudine pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa. The trials assessed pharmacokinetics in 16 women at 36 weeks' gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, 10 women at 38 weeks’ gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine, and 10 women at 38 weeks’ gestation using lamivudine 300 mg twice daily without other antiretrovirals. These trials were not designed or powered to provide efficacy information. Lamivudine concentrations were generally similar in maternal, neonatal, and umbilical cord serum samples. In a subset of subjects, amniotic fluid specimens were collected following natural rupture of membranes and confirmed that lamivudine crosses the placenta in humans. Based on limited data at delivery, median (range) amniotic fluid concentrations of lamivudine were 3.9 (1.2 to 12.8)–fold greater compared with paired maternal serum concentration (n = 8).</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> Lamivudine was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 90, 600, and 4,000 mg per kg per day) and rabbits (at 90, 300, and 1,000 mg per kg per day and at 15, 40, and 90 mg per kg per day) during organogenesis (on gestation Days 7 through 16 [rat] and 8 through 20 [rabbit]). No evidence of fetal malformations due to lamivudine was observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) approximately 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Evidence of early embryolethality was seen in the rabbit at system exposures (AUC) similar to those observed in humans, but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) 35 times higher than human exposure at the recommended daily dose. Studies in pregnant rats showed that lamivudine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta. In the fertility/pre-and postnatal development study in rats, lamivudine was administered orally at doses of 180, 900, and 4,000 mg per kg per day (from prior to mating through postnatal Day 20). In the study, development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, was not affected by maternal administration of lamivudine.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-1-infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1 infection. Lamivudine is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of lamivudine on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drugs on milk production. Because of the potential for (1) HIV-1 transmission (in HIV-negative infants), (2) developing viral resistance (in HIV-positive infants), and (3) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving lamivudine.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of lamivudine in combination with other antiretroviral agents have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. Lamivudine scored tablet is the preferred formulation for HIV-1-infected pediatric patients who weigh at least   14 kg and for whom a solid dosage form is appropriate because pediatric subjects who received Lamivudine Oral Solution had lower rates of virologic suppression, lower plasma lamivudine exposure, and developed viral resistance more frequently than those receiving lamivudine tablets in the ARROW trial <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of lamivudine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, caution should be exercised in the administration of lamivudine in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Impaired Renal Function</h3><p class="First">Reduction of the dosage of lamivudine is recommended for patients with impaired renal function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no known specific treatment for overdose with lamivudine. If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required. Because a negligible amount of lamivudine was removed via (4-hour) hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and automated peritoneal dialysis, it is not known if continuous hemodialysis would provide clinical benefit in a lamivudine overdose event.</p><h2>Lamivudine Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Lamivudine (also known as 3TC) is a synthetic nucleoside analogue with activity against HIV-1 and HBV. The chemical name of lamivudine is (2R,cis)-4-amino-l-(2-hydroxymethyl-l,3-oxathiolan-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidin-2-one. Lamivudine is the (-)enantiomer of a dideoxy analogue of cytidine. Lamivudine has also been referred to as (-)2',3'-dideoxy, 3'-thiacytidine. It has a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">8</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S and a molecular weight of 229.3 g per mol. It has the following structural formula: </p><p>Lamivudine USP is a white to off-white crystalline solid with a solubility of approximately 70 mg per mL in water at 20°C.<br/>
<br/>
Lamivudine Oral Solution USP is for oral administration. One milliliter (1 mL) of Lamivudine Oral Solution USP contains 10 mg of lamivudine USP (10 mg per mL) in an aqueous solution and the inactive ingredients are liquid strawberry flavor, liquid banana flavor, citric acid (anhydrous), methylparaben, propylene glycol, propylparaben, sodium citrate (dihydrate), and sucrose (200 mg).</p><h2>Lamivudine Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Lamivudine is an antiretroviral agent <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics in Adults</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been studied in asymptomatic, HIV-1-infected adult subjects after administration of single intravenous (IV) doses ranging from 0.25 to 8 mg per kg, as well as single and multiple (twice-daily regimen) oral doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg per kg.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have also been studied as single and multiple oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 600 mg per day administered to HBV-infected subjects.</p><p>The steady-state pharmacokinetic properties of the lamivudine 300 mg tablet once daily for 7 days compared with the lamivudine 150 mg tablet twice daily for 7 days were assessed in a crossover trial in 60 healthy subjects.

An investigational 25 mg dosage form of lamivudine was administered orally to 12 asymptomatic, HIV-1-infected subjects on 2 occasions, once in the fasted state and once with food (1,099 kcal; 75 grams fat, 34 grams protein, 72 grams carbohydrate). Absorption of lamivudine was slower in the fed state (T<span class="Sub">max</span>: 3.2 ± 1.3 hours) compared with the fasted state (T<span class="Sub">max</span>: 0.9 ± 0.3 hours); C<span class="Sub">max</span> in the fed state was 40% ± 23% (mean ± SD) lower than in the fasted state.

In humans, the only known metabolite of lamivudine is the trans-sulfoxide metabolite (approximately 5% of an oral dose after 12 hours). Serum concentrations of this metabolite have not been determined. Lamivudine is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination:</span> The majority of lamivudine is eliminated unchanged in urine by active organic cationic secretion. In 9 healthy subjects given a single 300 mg oral dose of lamivudine, renal clearance was 199.7 ± 56.9 mL per min (mean ± SD). In 20 HIV-1-infected subjects given a single IV dose, renal clearance was 280.4 ± 75.2 mL per min (mean ± SD), representing 71% ± 16% (mean ± SD) of total clearance of lamivudine.   </p><p>In most single-dose trials in HIV-1-infected subjects, HBV-infected subjects, or healthy subjects with serum sampling for 24 hours after dosing, the observed mean elimination half-life (t<span class="Sub">½</span>) ranged from 5 to 7 hours. In HIV-1-infected subjects, total clearance was 398.5 ± 69.1 mL per min (mean ± SD).

Pediatric subjects receiving lamivudine oral tablets achieved plasma concentrations comparable to or slightly higher than those observed in adults. The absolute bioavailability of both lamivudine tablets and oral solution are lower in children than adults. The relative bioavailability of Lamivudine Oral Solution is approximately 40% lower than tablets containing lamivudine in pediatric subjects despite no difference in adults. Lower lamivudine exposures in pediatric patients receiving Lamivudine Oral Solution is likely due to the interaction between lamivudine and concomitant solutions containing sorbitol (such as ZIAGEN). Modeling of pharmacokinetic data suggests increasing the dosage of Lamivudine Oral Solution to 5 mg per kg taken orally twice daily or 10 mg per kg taken orally once daily (up to a maximum of 300 mg daily) is needed to achieve sufficient concentrations of lamivudine <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.
