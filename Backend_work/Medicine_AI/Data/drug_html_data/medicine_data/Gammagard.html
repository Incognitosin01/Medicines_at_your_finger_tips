It contains the antibodies to help your body protect itself against infection from various diseases.</p><p>Gammagard is used to treat primary immunodeficiency diseases (PI) in adults and children two years of age or older.</p><p>Gammagard is also used as maintenance therapy to improve muscle strength and disability in adult patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN. MMN is a rare disease that causes muscle weakness that worsens over time. It affects the strength of the lower parts of arms and hands more than the legs, usually without affecting the touch sensation.</p><p>There are many forms of PI. The most common types of PI result in an inability to make a very important type of protein called antibodies, which help the body fight off infections from bacteria or viruses.</p><p>Gammagard is made from human plasma that is donated by healthy people. It contains antibodies collected from these healthy people that replace the missing antibodies in PI patients.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Gammagard can cause blood clots.
