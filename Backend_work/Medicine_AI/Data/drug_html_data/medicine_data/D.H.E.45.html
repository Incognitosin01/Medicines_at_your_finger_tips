</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serious and/or life-threatening peripheral ischemia has been associated with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors including protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics. Because CYP3A4 inhibition elevates the serum levels of dihydroergotamine, the risk for vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities is increased. Hence, concomitant use of these medications is contraindicated <span class="Italics">(see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).</span></span></p><h2>D.H.E. 45 Description</h2><p class="First">D.H.E. 45 is ergotamine hydrogenated in the 9, 10 position as the mesylate salt. D.H.E. 45 is known chemically as ergotaman-3´,6´,18-trione,9,10-dihydro-12´-hydroxy-2´-methyl-5´-(phenylmethyl)-,(5´α)-, monomethanesulfonate. Its molecular weight is 679.80 and its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">33</span>H<span class="Sub">37</span>N<span class="Sub">5</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>•CH<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S.</p><p>The chemical structure is:</p><p></p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate<br/>

Wt. 679.80</p><p>D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is a clear, colorless solution supplied in sterile ampuls for intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous administration. Each mL contains 1 mg Dihydroergotamine Mesylate, USP; Alcohol, USP 6.1% by volume; Glycerin, USP 15% by weight; Water for Injection, USP; Methanesulfonic Acid and/or Sodium Hydroxide for pH adjustment (pH range is 3.4 to 4.9).</p><h2>D.H.E. 45 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Dihydroergotamine binds with high affinity to 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span>α and 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span>β receptors. It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT<span class="Sub">1A</span>, 5-HT<span class="Sub">2A</span>, and 5-HT<span class="Sub">2C</span> receptors, noradrenaline α<span class="Sub">2A</span>, α<span class="Sub">2B</span> and α<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors, and dopamine D<span class="Sub">2L</span> and D<span class="Sub">3</span> receptors.</p><p>The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> receptors. Two current theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache. The alternative hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT<span class="Sub">1D</span> receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.</p><p>In addition, dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Absolute bioavailability for the subcutaneous and intramuscular route have not been determined; however, no difference was observed in dihydroergotamine bioavailability from intramuscular and subcutaneous doses.</p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate is poorly bioavailable following oral administration.</p><p class="First">Dihydroergotamine mesylate is 93% plasma protein bound. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 800 liters.</p><p class="First">Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration. The major metabolite, 8´-β-hydroxydihydroergotamine, exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5-HT receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> and <span class="Italics">in vitro.</span> The other metabolites, (i.e., dihydrolysergic acid, dihydrolysergic amide) and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance. Following nasal administration, total metabolites represent only 20% to 30% of plasma AUC. Quantitative pharmacokinetic characterization of the four metabolites has not been performed.</p><p class="First">The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces. The total body clearance is 1.5 L/min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance. Only 6% to 7% of unchanged dihydroergotamine is excreted in the urine after intramuscular injection. The renal clearance (0.1 L/min) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration. The decline of plasma dihydroergotamine after intramuscular or intravenous administration is multi-exponential with a terminal half-life of about 9 hours.</p><p class="First">No studies have been conducted on the effect of renal or hepatic impairment, gender, race, or ethnicity on dihydroergotamine pharmacokinetics. D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is contraindicated in patients with severely impaired hepatic or renal function (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported in patients treated orally with other ergot alkaloids (e.g., increased levels of ergotamine) and macrolide antibiotics, principally troleandomycin, presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of the alkaloids by troleandomycin. Dihydroergotamine has also been shown to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A catalyzed reactions and rare reports of ergotism have been obtained from patients treated with dihydroergotamine and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., troleandomycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), and in patients treated with dihydroergotamine and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P4503A metabolism of ergotamine (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). No pharmacokinetic interactions involving other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are known.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for D.H.E. 45</h2><p class="First">D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">There have been a few reports of serious adverse events associated with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics, resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. The use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (i.e., ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole) with dihydroergotamine is, therefore, contraindicated (<span class="Italics">see WARNINGS, CYP3A4 Inhibitors</span>).</p><p>D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be given to patients with ischemic heart disease (e.g., angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia) or to patients who have clinical symptoms or findings consistent with coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal's variant angina (<span class="Italics">see WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Because D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP may increase blood pressure, it should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension.</p><p>D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP, 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists (e.g., sumatriptan), ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications or methysergide should not be used within 24 hours of each other.</p><p>D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine.</p><p>In addition to those conditions mentioned above, D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is also contraindicated in patients with known peripheral arterial disease, sepsis, following vascular surgery and severely impaired hepatic or renal function.</p><p>D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties and, therefore, should not be administered during pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p>There are no adequate studies of dihydroergotamine in human pregnancy, but developmental toxicity has been demonstrated in experimental animals. In embryofetal development studies of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, intranasal administration to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and/or skeletal ossification at doses of 0.16 mg/day (associated with maternal plasma dihydroergotamine exposures [AUC] approximately 0.4 to 1.2 times the exposures in humans receiving the MRDD of 4 mg) or greater. A no effect level for embryofetal toxicity was not established in rats. Delayed skeletal ossification was also noted in rabbit fetuses following intranasal administration of 3.6 mg/day (maternal exposures approximately 7 times human exposures at the MRDD) during organogenesis. A no effect level was seen at 1.2 mg/day (maternal exposures approximately 2.5 times human exposures at the MRDD).</p><p>When dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray was administered intranasally to female rats during pregnancy and lactation, decreased body weights and impaired reproductive function (decreased mating indices) were observed in the offspring at doses of 0.16 mg/day or greater. A no effect level was not established. Effects on development occurred at doses below those that produced evidence of significant maternal toxicity in these studies.</p><p>Dihydroergotamine-induced intrauterine growth retardation has been attributed to reduced uteroplacental blood flow resulting from prolonged vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels and/or increased myometrial tone.</p><p>D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is contraindicated in patients who have previously shown hypersensitivity to ergot alkaloids.</p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate should not be used by nursing mothers (<span class="Italics">see PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><p>Dihydroergotamine mesylate should not be used with peripheral and central vasoconstrictors because the combination may result in additive or synergistic elevation of blood pressure.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established.</p><h3>CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease Inhibitors)</h3><p class="First">There have been rare reports of serious adverse events in connection with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics, resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and/or and ischemia of the extremities.  The use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with dihydroergotamine should therefore be avoided (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). Examples of some of the more potent CYP3A4 inhibitors include: antifungals ketoconazole and itraconazole, the protease inhibitors ritonavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir, and macrolide antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin. Other less potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be administered with caution. Less potent inhibitors include saquinavir, nefazodone, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, zileuton, and clotrimazole. These lists are not exhaustive, and the prescriber should consider the effects on CYP3A4 of other agents being considered for concomitant use with dihydroergotamine.</p><h3>Fibrotic Complications</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis in patients following prolonged daily use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate. Rarely, prolonged daily use of other ergot alkaloid drugs has been associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis. Rare cases have also been reported in association with the use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate; however, in those cases, patients also received drugs known to be associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis.</p><p>Administration of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP, should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration (<span class="Italics">see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events</h3><p class="First">D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be used by patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). It is strongly recommended that D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP not be given to patients in whom unrecognized coronary artery disease (CAD) is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, females who are surgically or physiologically postmenopausal, or males who are over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient's medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of or consistent with coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be administered (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><p>For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate)</p><p>Injection, USP take place in the setting of a physician's office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received dihydroergotamine mesylate. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use, an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP in those patients with risk factors.</p><p>It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.</p><p>The systematic approach described above is currently recommended as a method to identify patients in whom D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP may be used to treat migraine headaches with an acceptable margin of cardiovascular safety.</p><h3>Cardiac Events and Fatalities</h3><p class="First">The potential for adverse cardiac events exists. Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported to have occurred following the administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate injection. Considering the extent of use of dihydroergotamine mesylate in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low.</p><h3>Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities</h3><p class="First">Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP; and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack).</p><h3>Other Vasospasm-Related Events</h3><p class="First">D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP, like other ergot alkaloids, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Myocardial, peripheral vascular, and colonic ischemia have been reported with D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.</p><p>D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP associated vasospastic phenomena may also cause muscle pains, numbness, coldness, pallor, and cyanosis of the digits. In patients with compromised circulation, persistent vasospasm may result in gangrene or death. D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of vasoconstriction develop.</p><h3>Increase in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Significant elevation in blood pressure has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension treated with dihydroergotamine mesylate injection. D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><p>An 18% increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure was seen following dosing with another 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonist in a study evaluating subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP may cause coronary artery vasospasm; patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following its administration should, therefore, be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to variant angina before receiving additional doses. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud's syndrome following the use of any 5-HT agonist are candidates for further evaluation (see WARNINGS).</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">The text of a patient information sheet is printed at the end of this insert. To assure safe and effective use of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP, the information and instructions provided in the patient information sheet should be discussed with patients.</p><p>Patients should be advised to report to the physician immediately any of the following: numbness or tingling in the fingers and toes, muscle pain in the arms and legs, weakness in the legs, pain in the chest, temporary speeding or slowing of the heart rate, swelling, or itching.</p><p>Prior to the initial use of the product by a patient, the prescriber should take steps to ensure that the patient understands how to use the product as provided (see Patient Information Sheet and product packaging).</p><p>Administration of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration (<span class="Italics">see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be used with peripheral vasoconstrictors because the combination may cause synergistic elevation of blood pressure.</p><p class="First">Sumatriptan has been reported to cause coronary artery vasospasm, and its effect could be additive with D.H.E. 45(dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP. Sumatriptan and D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should not be taken within 24 hours of each other (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><p class="First">Although the results of a clinical study did not indicate a safety problem associated with the administration of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP to subjects already receiving propranolol, there have been reports that propranolol may potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine.</p><p class="First">Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients, predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy.</p><p class="First">Weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination have been reported rarely when 5-HT<span class="Sub">1</span> agonists have been co-administered with SSRI's (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline). There have been no reported cases from spontaneous reports of drug interaction between SSRI's and D.H.E. 45(dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP.</p><p class="First">The effect of oral contraceptives on the pharmacokinetics of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP has not been studied.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Assessment of the carcinogenic potential of dihydroergotamine mesylate in mice and rats is ongoing.</p><p class="First">Dihydroergotamine mesylate was clastogenic in two <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration assays, the V79 Chinese hamster cell assay with metabolic activation and the cultured human peripheral blood lymphocyte assay. There was no evidence of mutagenic potential when dihydroergotamine mesylate was tested in the presence or absence of metabolic activation in two gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay) and in an assay for DNA damage (the rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis test). Dihydroergotamine was not clastogenic in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse and hamster micronucleus tests.</p><p class="First">Impairment of fertility was not evaluated for D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP. There was no evidence of impairment of fertility in rats given intranasal doses of MigranaL<span class="Sup">®</span> Nasal Spray up to 1.6 mg/day (associated with mean plasma dihydroergotamine mesylate exposures [AUC] approximately 9 to 11 times those in humans receiving the MRDD of 4 mg).</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Ergot drugs are known to inhibit prolactin. It is likely that D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is excreted in human milk, but there are no data on the concentration of dihydroergotamine in human milk. It is known that ergotamine is excreted in breast milk and may cause vomiting, diarrhea, weak pulse, and unstable blood pressure in nursing infants. Because of the potential for these serious adverse events in nursing infants exposed to D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP, nursing should not be undertaken with the use of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP (<span class="Italics">see CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following use of D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP, but are extremely rare. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS). Fibrotic complications have been reported in association with long term use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate (<span class="Italics">see WARNINGS, Fibrotic Complications</span>).</p><h3>Post-introduction Reports</h3><p class="First">The following events derived from postmarketing experience have been occasionally reported in patients receiving D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP: vasospasm, paraesthesia, hypertension, dizziness, anxiety, dyspnea, headache, flushing, diarrhea, rash, increased sweating, and pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis after long-term use of dihydroergotamine. Extremely rare cases of myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported. A causal relationship has not been established.</p><p>D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is not recommended for prolonged daily use (s<span class="Italics">ee DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bausch Health US, LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><p class="First">Currently available data have not demonstrated drug abuse or psychological dependence with dihydroergotamine. However, cases of drug abuse and psychological dependence in patients on other forms of ergot therapy have been reported. Thus, due to the chronicity of vascular headaches, it is imperative that patients be advised not to exceed recommended dosages.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">To date, there have been no reports of acute overdosage with this drug. Due to the risk of vascular spasm, exceeding the recommended dosages of D.H.E. 45(dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP is to be avoided. Excessive doses of dihydroergotamine may result in peripheral signs and symptoms of ergotism. Treatment includes discontinuance of the drug, local application of warmth to the affected area, the administration of vasodilators, and nursing care to prevent tissue damage.</p><p>In general, the symptoms of an acute D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP overdose are similar to those of an ergotamine overdose, although there is less pronounced nausea and vomiting with D.H.E. 45(dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP. The symptoms of an ergotamine overdose include the following: numbness, tingling, pain, and cyanosis of the extremities associated with diminished or absent peripheral pulses; respiratory depression; an increase and/or decrease in blood pressure, usually in that order; confusion, delirium, convulsions, and coma; and/or some degree of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.</p><p>In laboratory animals, significant lethality occurs when dihydroergotamine is given at I.V. doses of 44 mg/kg in mice, 130 mg/kg in rats, and 37 mg/kg in rabbits.</p><p>Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdosage can often be obtained from a certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified Poison Control Centers are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physician's Desk Reference</span> (PDR).*</p><h2>D.H.E. 45 Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">D.H.E. 45 (dihydroergotamine mesylate) Injection, USP should be administered in a dose of 1 mL intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The dose can be repeated, as needed, at 1-hour intervals to a total dose of 3 mL for intramuscular or subcutaneous delivery or 2 mL for intravenous delivery in a 24-hour period.
