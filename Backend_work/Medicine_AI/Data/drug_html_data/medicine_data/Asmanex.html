Mometasone furoate prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation.</p><p>Asmanex is used to prevent asthma attacks.</p><p>Asmanex will not treat an asthma attack that has already begun.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Asmanex as a rescue medicine for asthma attacks.</b> It will not work fast enough. Use only fast-acting inhalation medicine for an attack.</p><p>Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well. An increased need for medication could be an early sign of a serious asthma attack.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Asmanex if you are allergic to mometasone, or to milk proteins.</p><p>To make sure Asmanex is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>glaucoma or cataracts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low bone mineral density; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a recent illness or infection of any kind, including tuberculosis.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>glaucoma or cataracts;</p><p>low bone mineral density; or</p><p>a recent illness or infection of any kind, including tuberculosis.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. It is not known whether mometasone will harm an unborn baby. However, having untreated or uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy may cause complications such as low birth weight, premature birth, or eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure that can lead to medical problems in both mother and baby). The benefit of treating asthma may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using Asmanex. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p>Do not give Asmanex to a child younger than 4 years old. <b>Asmanex HFA</b> should not be given to a child younger than 5 years old.</p><p>Long-term use of steroids may lead to bone loss (osteoporosis), especially if you smoke, if you do not exercise, if you do not get enough vitamin D or calcium in your diet, or if you have a family history of osteoporosis. Talk with your doctor about your risk of osteoporosis.</p><h2>How should I use Asmanex?</h2><p>Use Asmanex exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.</p><p><b>Asmanex is not a rescue medicine for asthma attacks.</b> Use only fast-acting inhalation medicine for an attack. Seek medical attention if your breathing problems get worse quickly, or if you think your asthma medications are not working as well.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Asmanex comes in a powder form that is preloaded in with a special inhaler device (twisthaler). The device will deliver a measured dose of mometasone as a fine spray of powder each time you use the inhaler.</p><p>You may or may not be able to feel or taste this powder in your mouth while using the inhaler. Do not use extra doses if you do not feel or taste the powder. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you think your inhaler is not working properly.</p><p>It may take up to 2 weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medication as directed and call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve after 1 week of treatment.</p><p>Rinse your mouth with water <b>without swallowing</b> after each use of your inhaler.</p><p>Mometasone can weaken (suppress) your immune system, and you may get an infection more easily.</p><p><b>If you also use an oral steroid medication, you should not stop using it suddenly.</b> Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.</p><p>Your dose needs may change if you have surgery, are ill, are under stress, or have recently had an asthma attack. Do not change your medication dose or schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p>If you switched to Asmanex from an oral (taken by mouth) steroid, you may need to restart the oral medicine if you are under stress or have an asthma attack or other medical emergency. Wear a medical alert tag or carry an ID card stating that you may need an oral steroid in an emergency.</p><p>Asthma is often treated with a combination of drugs. Use all medications as directed by your doctor. Read the medication guide or patient instructions provided with each medication. Do not change your doses or medication schedule without your doctor's advice.</p><p>Store Asmanex at room temperature away from moisture and heat. When you first open the foil pouch and remove the inhaler device, write the date on the device. Throw away the inhaler when the dose counter shows "00."</p><p>Keep the cap on your inhaler when not in use. Keep the inhalation aerosol canister away from open flame or high heat. The canister may explode if it gets too hot. Do not puncture or burn an empty inhaler canister.</p><p>Do not wash your inhaler device or allow it to get wet. Wipe the mouthpiece with a clean dry tissue or cloth.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose of Asmanex for Asthma -- Maintenance:</b></p><p>Inhalation Aerosol Powder:<br/>
