</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Efavirenz Tablets</h2><p class="First">Efavirenz in combination with other antiretroviral agents is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and in pediatric patients at least 3 months old and weighing at least 3.5 kg.</p><h2>Efavirenz Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Hepatic Function</h3><p class="First">Monitor hepatic function prior to and during treatment with Efavirenz <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].</span></p><p>Efavirenz is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Use in Specmc Populations (8.6)].</span></p><h3>Adults</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of efavirenz is 600 mg orally, once daily, in combination with a protease inhibitor and/or nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It is recommended that efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. The increased efavirenz concentrations observed following administration of efavirenz with food may lead to an increase in frequency of adverse reactions [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of nervous system symptoms [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.6) Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>, and <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)</span>]. Efavirenz Tablets 600mg should be swallowed intact with liquid. For patients who cannot swallow tablets, the capsule sprinkle method of administration is recommended [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>].</p><p>Concomitant Antiretroviral Therapy</p><p>Efavirenz must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medications [<span class="Italics">see Indications and Usage (1), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>, and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><p>Dosage Adjustment</p><p>If efavirenz is coadministered with voriconazole, the voriconazole maintenance dose should be increased to 400 mg every 12 hours and the efavirenz dose should be decreased to 300 mg once daily using the capsule formulation (one 200 mg and two 50 mg capsules or six 50 mg capsules).Efavirenz Tablets must not be broken. <span class="Italics">[See Drug Interactions (7.1, Table 5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3, Tables 7 and 8)].</span></p><p>If Efavirenz is coadministered with rifampin to patients weighing 50 kg or more, an increase in the dose of Efavirenz to 800 mg once daily is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1, Table 5)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3, Table 8)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">It is recommended that efavirenz be taken on an empty stomach, preferably at bedtime. Table 1 describes the recommended dose of efavirenz for pediatric patients 3 months of age or older and weighing between 3.5 kg and 40 kg [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. The recommended dosage of efavirenz for pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or greater is 600 mg once daily. For pediatric patients who cannot swallow capsules, the capsule contents can be administered with a small amount of food or infant formula using the capsule sprinkle method of administration [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span>]</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Efavirenz Dosing in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Capsules can be administered intact or as sprinkles [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4)</span> ].</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">b</span></span>  Tablets must not be crushed</p><h3>Capsule Sprinkle Method of Administration:</h3><p class="First">For pediatric patients at least 3 months old and weighing at least 3.5 kg and adults who cannot swallow capsules or tablets, the capsule contents may be administered with a small amount (1 to 2 teaspoons) of food. Use of infant formula for mixing should only be considered for those young infants who cannot reliably consume solid foods. Patients and caregivers should be instructed to open the capsule carefully to avoid spillage or dispersion of the capsule contents into the air. The capsule should be held horizontally over a small container and carefully twisted to open. For patients able to tolerate solid foods, the entire capsule contents should be gently mixed with an age-appropriate soft food, such as applesauce, grape jelly, or yogurt, in the small container. For young infants receiving the capsule sprinkle-infant formula mixture, the entire capsule contents should be gently mixed into 2 teaspoons of reconstituted room temperature infant formula in a small container by carefully stirring with a small spoon, and then drawing up the mixture into a 10 mL oral dosing syringe for administration. After administration of the efavirenz-food or –formula mixture, an additional small amount (approximately 2 teaspoons) of food or formula must be added to the empty mixing container, stirred to disperse any remaining efavirenz residue, and administered to the patient. The efavirenz-food or -formula mixture should be administered within 30 minutes of mixing. No additional food should be consumed for 2 hours after administration of efavirenz.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Tablets</li>
</ul><p class="First">   Efavirenz Tablets, 600 mg are off white colored, capsule shaped, film coated tablets imprinted with "600" on one side and plain on other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Efavirenz is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, or toxic skin eruptions) to any of the components of this product.</li>
<li>Coadministration of efavirenz with elbasvir and grazoprevir is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Efavirenz plasma concentrations may be altered by substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A. Likewise, efavirenz may alter plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6. The most prominent effect of efavirenz at steady-state is induction of CYP3A and CYP2B6<span class="Italics">. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h3>QTc Prolongation</h3><p class="First">QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.3, 7.4)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span> Consider alternatives to efavirenz when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes or when administered to patients at higher risk of Torsade de Pointes.</p><h3>Resistance</h3><p class="First">Efavirenz must not be used as a single agent to treat HIV-1 infection or added on as a sole agent to a failing regimen. Resistant virus emerges rapidly when efavirenz is administered as monotherapy. The choice of new antiretroviral agents to be used in combination with efavirenz should take into consideration the potential for viral cross-resistance.</p><h3>Coadministration with Related Products</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of Efavirenz with ATRIPLA (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) is not recommended unless needed for dose adjustment (eg, with rifampin) since efavirenz is one of its active ingredients.</p><h3>Psychiatric Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Serious psychiatric adverse experiences have been reported in patients treated with Efavirenz. In controlled trials of 1008 patients treated with regimens containing efavirenz for a mean of 2.1 years and 635 patients treated with control regimens for a mean of 1.5 years, the frequency (regardless of causality) of specific serious psychiatric events among patients who received Efavirenz or control regimens, respectively, were severe depression (2.4%, 0.9%), suicidal ideation (0.7%, 0.3%), nonfatal suicide attempts (0.5%, 0), aggressive behavior (0.4%, 0.5%), paranoid reactions (0.4%, 0.3%), and manic reactions (0.2%, 0.3%). When psychiatric symptoms similar to those noted above were combined and evaluated as a group in a multifactorial analysis of data from Study 006, treatment with efavirenz was associated with an increase in the occurrence of these selected psychiatric symptoms. Other factors associated with an increase in the occurrence of these psychiatric symptoms were history of injection drug use, psychiatric history, and receipt of psychiatric medication at study entry; similar associations were observed in both the Efavirenz and control treatment groups. In Study 006, onset of new serious psychiatric symptoms occurred throughout the study for both Efavirenz-treated and control-treated patients. One percent of Efavirenz-treated patients discontinued or interrupted treatment because of one or more of these selected psychiatric symptoms. There have also been occasional postmarketing reports of death by suicide, delusions, and psychosis-like behavior although a causal relationship to the use of Efavirenz cannot be determined from these reports. Postmarketing cases of catatonia have also been reported and may be associated with increased efavirenz exposure. Patients with serious psychiatric adverse experiences should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of Efavirenz, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits. [<span class="Italics">See Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>].</p><h3>Nervous System Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Fifty-three percent (531/1008) of patients receiving Efavirenz in controlled trials reported central nervous system symptoms (any grade, regardless of causality) compared to 25% (156/635) of patients receiving control regimens [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1, Table 3)</span>]. These symptoms included, but were not limited to, dizziness (28.1% of the 1008 patients), insomnia (16.3%), impaired concentration (8.3%), somnolence (7.0%), abnormal dreams (6.2%), and hallucinations (1.2%). These symptoms were severe in 2.0% of patients, and 2.1% of patients discontinued therapy as a result. These symptoms usually begin during the first or second day of therapy and generally resolve after the first 2-4 weeks of therapy. After 4 weeks of therapy, the prevalence of nervous system symptoms of at least moderate severity ranged from 5% to 9% in patients treated with regimens containing Efavirenz and from 3% to 5% in patients treated with a control regimen. Patients should be informed that these common symptoms were likely to improve with continued therapy and were not predictive of subsequent onset of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</span>]. Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of these nervous system symptoms [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2)</span>].</p><p>Analysis of long-term data from Study 006 (median follow-up 180 weeks, 102 weeks, and 76 weeks for patients treated with Efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, Efavirenz + indinavir, and indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine, respectively) showed that, beyond 24 weeks of therapy, the incidences of new-onset nervous system symptoms among Efavirenz-treated patients were generally similar to those in the indinavir-containing control arm.</p><p>Late-onset neurotoxicity, including ataxia and encephalopathy (impaired consciousness, confusion, psychomotor slowing, psychosis, delirium), may occur months to years after beginning efavirenz therapy. Some events of late-onset neurotoxicity have occurred in patients with CYP2B6 genetic polymorphisms which are associated with increased efavirenz levels despite standard dosing of Efavirenz. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of serious neurologic adverse experiences should be evaluated promptly to assess the possibility that these events may be related to efavirenz use, and whether discontinuation of Efavirenz is warranted.</p><p>Patients receiving Efavirenz should be alerted to the potential for additive central nervous system effects when Efavirenz is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs.</p><p>Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness, impaired concentration, and/or drowsiness should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Efavirenz may cause fetal harm when administered during the first trimester to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential who are receiving Efavirenz to avoid pregnancy. [<span class="Italics">See Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3)</span>.]</p><h3>Rash</h3><p class="First">In controlled clinical trials, 26% (266/1008) of adult patients treated with 600 mg Efavirenz experienced new-onset skin rash compared with 17% (111/635) of those treated in control groups [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Rash associated with blistering, moist desquamation, or ulceration occurred in 0.9% (9/1008) of patients treated with Efavirenz. The incidence of Grade 4 rash (eg, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) in adult patients treated with Efavirenz in all studies and expanded access was 0.1%. Rashes are usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occur within the first 2 weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz (median time to onset of rash in adults was 11 days) and, in most patients continuing therapy with efavirenz, rash resolves within 1 month (median duration, 16 days). The discontinuation rate for rash in adult clinical trials was 1.7% (17/1008).</p><p>Rash was reported in 59 of 182 pediatric patients (32%) treated with Efavirenz [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>]. Two pediatric patients experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever, generalized rash), and four patients had Grade 4 rash (erythema multiforme). The median time to onset of rash in pediatric patients was 28 days (range 3-1642 days). Prophylaxis with appropriate antihistamines before initiating therapy with Efavirenz in pediatric patients should be considered.</p><p>Efavirenz can generally be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. Efavirenz should be discontinued in patients developing severe rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement, or fever. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may improve the tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. For patients who have had a life-threatening cutaneous reaction (eg, Stevens- Johnson syndrome), alternative therapy should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Postmarketing cases of hepatitis, including fulminant hepatitis progressing to liver failure requiring transplantation or resulting in death, have been reported in patients treated with Efavirenz. Reports have included patients with underlying hepatic disease, including coinfection with hepatitis B or C, and patients without pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors.</p><p>Efavirenz is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Careful monitoring is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment receiving Efavirenz. <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><p>Monitoring of liver enzymes before and during treatment is recommended for all patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].</span> Consider discontinuing Efavirenz in patients with persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than five times the upper limit of the normal range.</p><p>Discontinue Efavirenz if elevation of serum transaminases is accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms of hepatitis or hepatic decompensation.</p><h3>Convulsions</h3><p class="First">Convulsions have been observed in adult and pediatric patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of known medical history of seizures [see <span class="Italics">Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)</span>]. Caution should be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medications primarily metabolized by the liver, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, may require periodic monitoring of plasma levels [see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>].</p><h3>Lipid Elevations</h3><p class="First">Treatment with Efavirenz has resulted in increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span>]. Cholesterol and triglyceride testing should be performed before initiating Efavirenz therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy.</p><h3>Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Efavirenz. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as <span class="Italics">Mycobacterium avium</span> infection, cytomegalovirus, <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis jiroveci</span> pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p><p>Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome and and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p><h3>Fat Redistribution</h3><p class="First">Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and "cushingoid appearance" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most significant adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Efavirenz are:</p><ul class="Disc">

In controlled trials, psychiatric symptoms observed at a frequency greater than 2% among patients treated with Efavirenz or control regimens, respectively, were depression (19%, 16%), anxiety (13%, 9%), and nervousness (7%, 2%).</p><p>Rash</p><p>In controlled clinical trials, the frequency of rash (all grades, regardless of causality) was 26 % for 1008 adults treated with regimens containing Efavirenz and 17% for 635 adults treated with a control regimen. Most reports of rash were mild or moderate in severity. The frequency of Grade 3 rash was 0.8% for Efavirenz-treated patients and 0.3% for control groups, and the frequency of Grade 4 rash was 0.1% for Efavirenz and 0 for control groups. The discontinuation rates as a result of rash were 1.7% for Efavirenz-treated patients and 0.3% for control groups [<span class="Italics">See Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].</span></p><p>Experience with Efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the NNRTI class is limited. Nineteen patients who discontinued nevirapine because of rash have been treated with Efavirenz. Nine of these patients developed mild-to-moderate rash while receiving therapy with Efavirenz, and two of these patients discontinued because of rash.</p><p>Laboratory Abnormalities</p><p>Selected Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities reported in ≥ 2% of Efavirenz-treated patients in two clinical trials are presented in Table 4.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 4: Selected Grade 3-4 Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in ≥2% of Efavirenz-Treated Patients in Studies 006 and ACTG 364</span></p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Efavirenz provided as 600 mg once daily.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">b</span> Median duration of treatment.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">c</span> Isolated elevations of GGT in patients receiving efavirenz may reflect enzyme induction not associated with liver toxicity.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">d</span> Nonfasting.</p><p class="First Footnote">ZDV = zidovudine, LAM = lamivudine, ULN = Upper limit of normal, ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, GGT = gamma-glutamyltransferase.</p><p><span class="Italics">Patients Coinfected with Hepatitis B or C</span></p><p>Liver function tests should be monitored in patients with a history of hepatitis B and/or C. In the long-term data set from Study 006, 137 patients treated with Efavirenz-containing regimens (median duration of therapy, 68 weeks) and 84 treated with a control regimen (median duration, 56 weeks) were seropositive at screening for hepatitis B (surface antigen positive) and/or C (hepatitis C antibody positive). Among these coinfected patients, elevations in AST to greater than five times ULN developed in 13% of patients in the Efavirenz arms and 7% of those in the control arm, and elevations in ALT to greater than five times ULN developed in 20% of patients in the Efavirenz arms and 7% of patients in the control arm. Among coinfected patients, 3% of those treated with Efavirenz-containing regimens and 2% in the control arm discontinued from the study because of liver or biliary system disorders [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Lipids</span></p><p>Increases from baseline in total cholesterol of 10 - 20% have been observed in some uninfected volunteers receiving Efavirenz. In patients treated with Efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine, increases from baseline in nonfasting total cholesterol and HDL of approximately 20% and 25%, respectively, were observed. In patients treated with Efavirenz + indinavir, increases from baseline in nonfasting cholesterol and HDL of approximately 40% and 35%, respectively, were observed. Nonfasting total cholesterol levels ≥240 mg/dL and ≥300 mg/dL were reported in 34% and 9%, respectively, of patients treated with Efavirenz + zidovudine + lamivudine; 54% and 20%, respectively, of patients treated with Efavirenz + indinavir; and 28% and 4%, respectively, of patients treated with indinavir + zidovudine + lamivudine. The effects of Efavirenz on triglycerides and LDL in this study were not well characterized since samples were taken from nonfasting patients. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</span>].</p><p>Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients</p><p>Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates reported cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical studies and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>Assessment of adverse reactions is based on three clinical trials in 182 HIV-1 infected pediatric patients (3 months to 21 years of age) who received Efavirenz in combination with other antiretroviral agents for a median of 123 weeks. The adverse reactions observed in the three trials were similar to those observed in clinical trials in adults except that rash was more common in pediatric patients (32% for all grades regardless of causality) and more often of higher grade (ie, more severe). Two (1.1%) pediatric patients experienced Grade 3 rash (confluent rash with fever, generalized rash), and four (2.2%) pediatric patients had Grade 4 rash (all erythema multiforme). Five pediatric patients (2.7%) discontinued from the study because of rash [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Efavirenz.

Consider alternatives to Efavirenz when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.</p><h3>Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Drug interactions with Efavirenz are summarized in Table 5. For pharmacokinetics data, [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>] Tables 7 and 8.</p><p>This table includes potentially significant interactions, but is not all inclusive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5: Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction</span></p><h3>Drugs Without Clinically Significant Interactions with Efavirenz</h3><p class="First">No dosage adjustment is recommended when Efavirenz is given with the following: aluminum/magnesium hydroxide antacids, azithromycin, cetirizine, famotidine, fluconazole, lorazepam, nelfinavir, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, zidovudine), paroxetine, and raltegravir.</p><h3>Cannabinoid Test Interaction</h3><p class="First">Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV-infected subjects receiving efavirenz. Confirmation of positive screening tests for cannabinoids by a more specific method is recommended.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Efavirenz during pregnancy. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry at 1-800-258-4263.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are retrospective case reports of neural tube defects in infants whose mothers were exposed to efavirenz containing regimens in the first trimester of pregnancy. Prospective pregnancy data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry are not sufficient to adequately assess this risk. Available data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry show no difference in the risk of overall major birth defects compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP). Although a causal relationship has not been established between exposure to efavirenz in the first trimester and neural tube defects, similar malformations have been observed in studies conducted in monkeys at doses similar to the human dose. In addition, fetal and embryonic toxicities occurred in rats, at a dose ten times less than the human exposure at recommended clinical dose. Because of the potential risk of neural tube defects, efavirenz should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>There are retrospective postmarketing reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, including meningomyelocele, all in infants of mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens in the first trimester.</p><p>Based on prospective reports from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) of approximately 1000 live births following exposure to efavirenz containing regimens (including over 800 live births exposed in the first trimester), there was no difference between efavirenz and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate of 2.7% in the U.S. reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program. As of the interim APR report issued December 2014, the prevalence of birth defects following first-trimester exposure was 2.3% (95% CI: 1.4%-3.6%). One of these prospectively reported defects with first-trimester exposure was a neural tube defect. A single case of anophthalmia with first-trimester exposure to efavirenz has also been prospectively reported. This case also included severe oblique facial clefts and amniotic banding, which have a known association with anophthalmia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Effects of efavirenz on embryo-fetal development have been studied in three nonclinical species (cynomolgus monkeys, rats, and rabbits). In monkeys, efavirenz 60 mg/kg/day was administered to pregnant females throughout pregnancy (gestation days 20 through 150). The maternal systemic drug exposures (AUC) were 1.3 times the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (600 mg/day), with fetal umbilical venous drug concentrations approximately 0.7 times the maternal values. Three of 20 fetuses/infants had one or more malformations; there were no malformed fetuses or infants from placebo-treated mothers. The malformations that occurred in these three monkey fetuses included anencephaly and unilateral anophthalmia in one fetus, microphthalmia in a second, and cleft palate in the third. There was no NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) established for this study because only one dosage was evaluated. In rats, efavirenz was administered either during organogenesis (gestation days 7 to 18) or from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 at 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day. Administration of 200 mg/kg/day in rats was associated with increase in the incidence of early resorptions; and doses 100 mg/kg/day and greater were associated with early neonatal mortality. The AUC at the NOAEL (50 mg/kg/day) in this rat study was 0.1 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose. Drug concentrations in the milk on lactation day 10 were approximately 8 times higher than those in maternal plasma. In pregnant rabbits, efavirenz was neither embryo lethal nor teratogenic when administered at doses of 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg/day over the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 through 18). The AUC at the NOAEL (75 mg/kg/day) in rabbits was 0.4 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV. Because of the potential for HIV transmission in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Because of potential teratogenic effects, pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving Efavirenz.

Barrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception. Hormonal methods that contain progesterone may have decreased effectiveness [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7.1)</span>].</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and virologic and immunologic responses of Efavirenz were evaluated in antiretroviral-naive and -experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric patients 3 months to 21 years of age in three open-label clinical trials [<span class="Italics">see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3),</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>]. The type and frequency of adverse reactions in these trials were generally similar to those of adult patients with the exception of a higher frequency of rash, including a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 rash, in pediatric patients compared to adults [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span> and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].</p><p>Use of Efavirenz in patients younger than 3 months of age OR less than 3.5 kg body weight is not recommended because the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of Efavirenz have not been evaluated in this age group and there is a risk of developing HIV resistance if Efavirenz is underdosed. See <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span> for dosing recommendations for pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Efavirenz did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Efavirenz is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment because there are insufficient data to determine whether dose adjustment is necessary. Patients with mild hepatic impairment may be treated with efavirenz without any adjustment in dose. Because of the extensive cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of efavirenz and limited clinical experience in patients with hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised in administering Efavirenz to these patients [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.9)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg twice daily have reported increased nervous system symptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions.</p><p>Treatment of overdose with Efavirenz should consist of general supportive measures, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient's clinical status. Administration of activated charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug. There is no specific antidote for overdose with Efavirenz. Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is unlikely to significantly remove the drug from blood.</p><h2>Efavirenz Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Efavirenz Tablets USP are an HIV-1 specific, non-nucleoside, reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).

Efavirenz activity is mediated predominantly by noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. HIV-2 reverse transcriptase and human cellular DNA polymerases α, β, γ, and δ are not inhibited by efavirenz.</p><p>Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture</p><p>The concentration of efavirenz inhibiting replication of wild-type laboratory adapted strains and clinical isolates in cell culture by 90-95% (EC<span class="Sub">90-95</span>) ranged from 1.7 to 25 nM in lymphoblastoid cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and macrophage/monocyte cultures. Efavirenz demonstrated antiviral activity against clade B and most non-clade B isolates (subtypes A, AE, AG, C, D, F, G, J, N), but had reduced antiviral activity against group O viruses. Efavirenz demonstrated additive antiviral activity without cytotoxicity against HIV-1 in cell culture when combined with the NNRTIs delavirdine and nevirapine, NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine, zidovudine), PIs (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir), and the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. Efavirenz demonstrated additive to antagonistic antiviral activity in cell culture with atazanavir.

Genotypic characterization of these viruses identified single amino acid substitutions L100I or V179D, double substitutions L100I/V108I, and triple substitutions L100I/V179D/Y181C in reverse transcriptase.</p><p><span class="Italics">Clinical studies</span></p><p>Clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility in cell culture to efavirenz have been obtained. One or more substitutions at amino acid positions 98, 100, 101, 103, 106, 108, 188, 190, 225, and 227 in reverse transcriptase were observed in patients failing treatment with efavirenz in combination with indinavir, or with zidovudine plus lamivudine. The K103N substitution was the most frequently observed. Long-term resistance surveillance (average 52 weeks, range 4-106 weeks) analyzed 28 matching baseline and virologic failure isolates. Sixty-one percent (17/28) of these failure isolates had decreased efavirenz susceptibility in cell culture with a median 88-fold change in efavirenz susceptibility (EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value) from reference. The most frequent NNRTI substitution to develop in these patient isolates was K103N (54%). Other NNRTI substitutions that developed included L100I (7%), K101E/Q/R (14%), V108I (11%), G190S/T/A (7%), P225H (18%), and M230I/L (11%).</p><p>Cross-Resistance</p><p>Cross-resistance among NNRTIs has been observed.

No increases in tumor incidence above background were seen in males. There was no NOAEL in females established for this study because tumor findings occurred at all doses. AUC at the NOAEL (150 mg/kg) in the males was approximately 0.9 times that in humans at the recommended clinical dose. In the rat study, no increases in tumor incidence were observed at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, for which AUCs were 0.1 (males) or 0.2 (females) times those in humans at the recommended clinical dose.</p><p>Mutagenesis</p><p>Efavirenz tested negative in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> genotoxicity assays.
