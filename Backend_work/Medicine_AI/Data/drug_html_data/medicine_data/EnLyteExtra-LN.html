<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">GLUTEN-FREE</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span></p><p><span class="Bold">EnLyte<span class="Sup">TM</span> Extra-LN</span> is an orally administered prescription hematinic drug for therapeutic use formulated for adult macrocytic anemia patients – specifically the treatment of pernicious anemia and the prevention of folate deficiency, ages 12 and up, who are under specific direction and monitoring of cobalamin and folate status by a physician. <span class="Bold">EnLyte<span class="Sup">TM</span> Extra-LN</span> may be useful in patients at risk of depression due to a deficiency of cobalamin and/or folate. <span class="Bold">EnLyte<span class="Sup">TM</span> Extra-LN</span> may be taken by women of childbearing age. <span class="Bold">EnLyte<span class="Sup">TM</span> Extra-LN</span> may be taken by geriatric patients where compliance is an issue. <span class="Bold">EnLyte<span class="Sup">TM</span> Extra-LN</span> may be taken in pediatric situations where age-appropriate oral ingestion is not a concern given strict monitoring of a physician but should never replace parenteral treatment - especially in that age group where the permanent effects of folate and/or cobalamin deficiency rapidly develop at a pace markedly different than adult populations.</p><h3>ACTIVE INGREDIENTS</h3><p class="First">Cobalamin-intrinsic factor concentrate ..... 1 NF Units* +</p><p>Reduced folic acid, DHF- ..... 1 mg ++</p><p>+ 50 mcg coenzyme-B12 (<span class="Italics">25 mcg as adenosyl cobamamide and 25 mcg as methyl cobalamin</span>), and 25 mg of intrinsic factor concentrate from<br/>
ultra-purified, porcine-derived stomach/liver substance from a porcine, disease-free country. Together these equal 1 NF Units.</p><p>++ 15 mg DFE [<span class="Italics">Dietary Folate Equivalent</span>] from total folates [<span class="Italics">as 15 mg DeltaFolate<span class="Sup">TM</span></span>] - l-methylfolate magnesium and folinic acid, as reconstituted factions of the liver-stomach substance derived, intrinsic factor cofactors naturally present but lost in the purification process. Note: The FDA has stated there exists little evidence of doses above 1 mg of folic acid have any greater efficacy in approved indications - including megaloblastic anemias.</p><h2>EXCIPIENTS</h2><p class="First">FUNCTIONAL EXCIPIENT:  25 mg ascorbates <span class="Italics">(3,4) </span>[<span class="Italics">24 mg magnesium l-ascorbate, 1 mg zinc l-ascorbate</span>] [antioxidant], 450 mcg cobalamin <span class="Italics">(3)</span> [thickening agent]; methacrylic acid-divinylbenzene copolymer <span class="Italics">(3)</span> [cobalamin carrier]; phosphatE <span class="Italics">(3)</span> [<span class="Italics">5 mg pyridoxal 5' phosphate</span>] [pH-adjuster]; at least 23.33 mg phospholipid-omega complex <span class="Italics">(5)</span> [<span class="Italics">marine lipids]</span> [blending agent]; at least 5 mg riboflavin <span class="Italics">(3)</span> [colorant]; and 1 mg magnesium l-threonate [stabilizer].</p><p><span class="Italics">OTHER EXCIPIENTS: "Annatto color" (as a blend of annatto with riboflavin) [colorant]; gelatin (bovine); glycerine; plant lipids (sunflower) [lecithin]; piperine [bioavailability enhancer]; purified water; yellow beeswax.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">(3) </span><span class="Bold">25</span><span class="Bold"> mg ASCORBIC ACID </span><span class="Italics">(21CFR182.3013), </span><span class="Bold">450 mcg CYANOCOBALAMIN </span><span class="Italics">(21CFR184.1945), </span><span class="Bold">5 mg RIBOFLAVIN </span><span class="Italics">(21CFR184.1695 and 21CFR73.450), </span><span class="Bold">5 mg PHOSPHATE </span><span class="Italics">(21CFR182.1073) - as PYRIDOXAL 5' PHOSPHATE, </span>and <span class="Bold">METHACRYLIC ACID-DIVINYLBENZENE COPOLYMER </span><span class="Italics">(21CFR172.775) as FUNCTIONAL EXCIPIENTS.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">(4) NOT a significant source of magnesium and zinc.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">(5) Contains at least 12 mg phosphatidylserine (PS) – of which approximately 6.4 mg as PS-DHA-Ca, and less than 1% EPA (&lt;800 mcg PS-EPA-Ca).</span></p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">The adult dose is one capsule daily preferably on an empty stomach.</p><p><span class="Italics">As a general rule - in patients with Addisonian Pernicious Anemia, treatment will be required for the remainder of the patient’s life. Reticulocyte plasma count, cobalamin and folate must be obtained prior to treatment.</span></p><h2>MECHANISM OF ACTION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cobalamin</span> [<span class="Italics">treatment</span>]; <span class="Bold">Folate</span> [<span class="Italics">prevention</span>]; <span class="Bold">Intrinsic Factor</span> [<span class="Italics">facilitator</span>] -</p><p>[<span class="Italics">Cobalamin</span>]</p><p>   Cobalamin deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia, GI lesions, and neurological damage that begins with an inability to produce myelin and is followed by gradual degeneration of the axon and nerve head. <span class="Italics">cobalamin has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the anti-anemia factor in purified liver extract.</span></p><p>[<span class="Italics">Cobalamin</span>] / [<span class="Italics">Intrinsic factor</span>]</p><p>   Gastrointestinal absorption of cobalamin depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia - which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.</p><p>[<span class="Italics">Folate</span>]</p><p>   Folate deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia. Folate stimulates specifically the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in persons suffering from certain megaloblastic anemias.<br/>
Folic acid, formylfolic acid and l-methylfolic acid metabolism results in the creation of tetrahydrofolic acid by different pathways. Both formylfolic acid and l-methylfolic acid acid do not require dihydrofolate reductase (DHR), however folic acid does.</p><p>[<span class="Italics">Folate</span>] / [<span class="Italics">Cobalamin</span>]</p><p>   Cobalamin is essential for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine - a reaction which also requires folate. In the absence of cobalamin, tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and a functional folate deficiency occurs (ie, “methyl trap hypothesis”). Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) - such as methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), may also inhibited cobalamin intracellular conversion due to impaired ability to metabolize folic acid.</p><h2>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EnLyte<span class="Sup">TM</span> Extra-LN</span> is indicated in the treatment of macrocytic anemias resulting from cobalamin deficiency - including pernicious anemia, and the prevention of folate deficiency;</p><p><span class="Bold">EnLyte<span class="Sup">TM </span>Extra-LN </span>is indicated as a primary and adjunctive treatment in megaloblastic anemia associated with tropical and non-tropical sprue, in anemias of nutritional origen, pregnancy, alcoholism, infancy and childhood as well as pernicious anemia patients having idiosyncrasy or sensitivity to parenteral administration (or when parental therapy is refused);</p><p><span class="Bold">EnLyte<span class="Sup">TM </span>Extra-LN </span>is indicated in the maintenance of normal hematologic status (hematopoiesis) as well as supplement for other cobalamin deficiencies, including:</p><p><span class="Italics">Requirements of cobalamin and/or folate in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of entire body may occur with administration of cobalamin. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">GENERAL:</p><p>0.1 mg or more of folic acid daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that the hematological remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The safe tolerable limit for folic acid (<span class="Italics">in preparations</span>) is 1 mg [emphasis added];</p><p>Folic acid is not a substitute for vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> - although it may improve vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-deficient megaloblastic anemia. Exclusive use of folic acid in treating vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-deficient megaloblastic anemia could result in progressive and irreversible neurologic damage. Specifically, vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency allowed to progress over 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord - as observed when folate therapy is used as the only hematopoietic agent;</p><p>Doses of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis; and -</p><p>A dietary deficiency of only vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is rare; multiple vitamin deficiency is expected in any dietary deficiency. No single regimen fits all cases, and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy.</p><p>DRUG INTERACTIONS:</p><p>Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid, and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of cobalamin.</p><h2>CONTAINS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FISH/KRILL/PORCINE (INTRINSIC FACTOR)/SOY</span></p><p>Certified 3rd-party GLUTEN-FREE.
