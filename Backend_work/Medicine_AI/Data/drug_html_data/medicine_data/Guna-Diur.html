DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Guna-Diur is a biochemical homeopathic medication indicated for the treatment of fluid retention, swelling, essential hypertension, lymphedema, and related discomforts.<br/></p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">12.1.    Mechanism of Action<br/>
The active ingredients in GUNA®- DIUR are simple biochemical compounds.   The exact mechanism of action is unknown; however, due to the homeopathic nature of the active ingredients, receptors may be activated by feedback regulation. <br/>
12.2.    Pharmacodynamics<br/>
The physiological effects of GUNA®-DIUR are due to the action of the ingredients, as described in the Homeopathic Materia Medica.<br/>
In Homeopathy there is no direct relationship between dose and effect, but rather there is a relationship between attenuation and balancing effect on biochemical pathways.<br/>
In GUNA®-DIUR the attenuation of each ingredient has been selected according to Arndt-Schulz Principle (inverted effect law). The attenuation of the physiological ingredients promotes membrane receptor feedback in order to normalize altered biological pathways. In Addition the attenuation technique activates the low dilutions and stabilizes clinical activity of the compound.<br/>
12.3.    Pharmacokinetics<br/>
The homeopathic attenuation provides complete bioavailability of the active ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><p class="First">13.1.    GUNA®-DIUR has no level of toxicity due to the attenuation of the ingredients<br/>
<br/></p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">14.1.    GUNA®-DIUR formulation is based on classical Homeopathy and each ingredient has been selected according to its description in the Homeopathic Materia Medica<br/></p><h2>15.
