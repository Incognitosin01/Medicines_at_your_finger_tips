Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not be inclusive of all possible immune-mediated reactions.</p><p>Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies.</p><p>Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor for symptoms and signs of immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries, including liver tests and thyroid function tests, at baseline and periodically during treatment. Institute medical management promptly to include specialty consultation as appropriate.</p><p>In general, withhold LIBTAYO for Grade 3 or 4 and certain Grade 2 immune-mediated adverse reactions. Permanently discontinue LIBTAYO for Grade 4 and certain Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. For Grade 3 or 4 and certain Grade 2 immune-mediated adverse reactions, administer corticosteroids (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) or other appropriate therapy until improvement to Grade 1 or less followed by a corticosteroid taper over one month <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reaction is not controlled with corticosteroids. Institute hormone replacement therapy for endocrinopathies as warranted.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis</span></p><p>Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 2.4% of 534 patients receiving LIBTAYO, including Grade 5 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.7%) and Grade 2 (1.3%) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of LIBTAYO in 1.3% of patients.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion or permanently discontinue LIBTAYO based on severity of reaction <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on its mechanism of action, LIBTAYO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LIBTAYO and for at least 4 months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Infusion-Related Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to LIBTAYO in 534 patients in two open-label, single-arm, multicohort studies (Study 1423 and Study 1540), including 98 patients with metastatic (nodal or distant) CSCC, 65 patients with locally advanced CSCC, and 371 patients with other advanced solid tumors. LIBTAYO as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation was administered intravenously at doses of 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=27), 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=446), 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=12), 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=6), 200 mg every 2 weeks (n=20) or 350 mg every 3 weeks (n=23). Among the 534 patients, 38% were exposed for ≥ 6 months and 16% were exposed for ≥ 12 months.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to LIBTAYO in 163 patients with advanced CSCC (metastatic or locally advanced disease) in Study 1423 and Study 1540 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. Patients received LIBTAYO 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=1), 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=139) or 350 mg every 3 weeks (n=23) as an intravenous infusion until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned treatment. The median duration of exposure was 20 weeks (3 days to 1.4 years).</p><p>The safety population characteristics were: median age of 71 years (38 to 96 years), 85% male, 96% white, and ECOG performance score (PS) of 0 (44%) or 1 (56%).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 20% of patients were fatigue, rash and diarrhea. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (≥ 2%) were cellulitis, sepsis, hypertension, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain, skin infection, urinary tract infection and fatigue. LIBTAYO was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of patients; adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were pneumonitis, autoimmune myocarditis, hepatitis, aseptic meningitis, complex regional pain syndrome, cough, and muscular weakness. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients were cellulitis, sepsis, pneumonia, pneumonitis and urinary tract infection.</p><p>Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 10% of patients and Table 3 summarizes Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities worsening from baseline in ≥ 1% of patients receiving LIBTAYO.</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to cemiplimab-rwlc in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p><p>Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were tested in 398 of 534 patients who received LIBTAYO and the incidence of cemiplimab-rwlc treatment-emergent ADAs was 1.3% using an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassay; 0.3% were persistent ADA responses. In the patients who developed anti-cemiplimab-rwlc antibodies, there was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic profile of cemiplimab-rwlc.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on its mechanism of action, LIBTAYO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</span>. There are no available data on the use of LIBTAYO in pregnant women. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Human IgG4 immunoglobulins (IgG4) are known to cross the placenta; therefore, LIBTAYO has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with LIBTAYO to evaluate its effect on reproduction and fetal development. A central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. In murine models of pregnancy, blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering LIBTAYO during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to cemiplimab-rwlc may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of cemiplimab-rwlc in human milk, or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of LIBTAYO.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span></p><p>Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LIBTAYO <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p>LIBTAYO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LIBTAYO and for at least 4 months after the last dose.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of LIBTAYO have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 163 patients with metastatic and locally advanced CSCC who received LIBTAYO in clinical studies, 72% were 65 years or older and 37% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.</p><h2>Libtayo Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Cemiplimab-rwlc is a human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody. Cemiplimab-rwlc is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. Cemiplimab-rwlc is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell suspension culture. Cemiplimab-rwlc has an approximate molecular weight of 146 kDa.</p><p>LIBTAYO (cemiplimab-rwlc) injection for intravenous use is a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution with a pH of 6. The solution may contain trace amounts of translucent to white particles.</p><p>Each vial contains 350 mg of cemiplimab-rwlc. Each mL contains cemiplimab-rwlc 50 mg, L-histidine (0.74 mg), L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate (1.1 mg), sucrose (50 mg), L-proline (15 mg), Polysorbate 80 (2 mg), and Water for Injection, USP.</p><h2>Libtayo Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Binding of the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors.</p><p>Cemiplimab-rwlc is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Cemiplimab-rwlc pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected in 505 patients with various solid tumors, including 135 patients with CSCC. The PK of cemiplimab-rwlc was linear and dose proportional in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg administered intravenously every two weeks and 350 mg intravenously administered every three weeks.</p><p>After a dose of 350 mg LIBTAYO administered intravenously every 3 weeks, median steady-state concentrations (CV%) of cemiplimab-rwlc ranged between a maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max,ss</span>) of 166 mcg/mL (28%) and a minimum concentration (C<span class="Sub">min,ss</span>) of 59 mcg/mL (48%). Steady-state exposure is achieved after approximately 4 months of treatment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The volume of distribution of cemiplimab-rwlc at steady state is 5.3 L (25%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Cemiplimab-rwlc clearance (CV%) after the first dose is 0.32 L/day (39%) and decreases over time by 34%, resulting in a steady-state clearance (CL<span class="Sub">ss</span>) (CV%) of 0.21 L/day (39%). The elimination half-life (CV%) at steady state is 19 days (30%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>The following factors have no clinically important effect on the exposure of cemiplimab-rwlc: age (27 to 96 years), sex, body weight (31 to 156 kg), race (White, Black, Asian and other), cancer type, albumin level (22 to 48 g/L), renal function (creatinine clearance determined by Cockcroft-Gault 25 mL/min or greater) and hepatic function (total bilirubin 0.35 to 45 µmol/L). LIBTAYO has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No studies have been performed to assess the potential of cemiplimab-rwlc for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity.</p><p>In a 3-month repeat-dose toxicology study in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys, there were no cemiplimab-rwlc-related effects on fertility parameters (menstrual cycle, semen analysis, or testicular measurements) or in male or female reproductive organs at doses up to the highest dose tested, 50 mg/kg/week (approximately 5.5 to 25.5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 350 mg once every 3 weeks).</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">In animal models, inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 signaling increased the severity of some infections and enhanced inflammatory responses. <span class="Italics">M. tuberculosis</span>–infected PD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals. PD-L1 and PD-1 knockout mice and mice receiving PD-L1 blocking antibody have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy of LIBTAYO in patients with metastatic (nodal or distant) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC who were not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation was evaluated in two open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, multicohort studies: Study 1423 (NCT02383212) and 1540 (NCT02760498). Both studies excluded patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy with immunosuppressant agents within 5 years; history of solid organ transplant; prior treatment with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies or other immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy; infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C; or ECOG performance score (PS) ≥ 2.</p><p>Patients received LIBTAYO 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks for up to 48 weeks in Study 1423 or up to 96 weeks in Study 1540. Treatment continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of planned treatment. Tumor response assessments were performed every 8 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by independent central review (ICR) and ICR-assessed duration of response. For patients with metastatic CSCC without externally visible target lesions, ORR was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). For patients with externally visible target lesions (locally advanced and metastatic CSCC), ORR was determined by a composite endpoint that integrated ICR assessments of radiologic data (RECIST 1.1) and digital medical photography (WHO criteria). The efficacy analysis was conducted when all patients had the opportunity for at least 6 months of follow-up.</p><p>A total of 26 patients with CSCC were enrolled in Study 1423 and 82 patients were enrolled in Study 1540. Of these 108 patients, 75 had metastatic CSCC and 33 had locally advanced CSCC. The median age was 71 years (38 to 96 years); 85% were male; 97% were White; 43% had ECOG PS 0 and 57% had ECOG PS 1; 50% received at least one prior anti-cancer systemic therapy; 96% received prior cancer-related surgery; and 79% received prior radiotherapy. Among patients with metastatic CSCC, 69% had distant metastases and 31% had only nodal metastases.</p><p>Efficacy results are presented in Table 4.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">LIBTAYO (cemiplimab-rwlc) injection is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution that may contain trace amounts of translucent to white particles.
