</ul><h2>CNL8 Description</h2><p class="First">CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer.</p><p>For use on fingernails and toenails and immediately adjacent skin only.</p><p>Not for use in eyes.<br/></p><p>CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer contains a synthetic antifungal agent, ciclopirox. It is intended for topical use on fingernails and toenails and immediately adjacent skin.<br/></p><p>Each gram of CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer contains 80 mg ciclopirox in a solution base consisting of ethyl acetate, NF; isopropyl alcohol, USP; and butyl monoester of poly[methylvinyl ether/maleic acid] in isopropyl alcohol. Ethyl acetate and isopropyl alcohol are solvents that vaporize after application.</p><p>CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer is a clear, colorless to slightly yellowish solution.<br/></p><p>The chemical name for ciclopirox is 6-cyclohexyl-1-hydroxy-4-methyl-2(1H)-pyridone, with the molecular formula C12H17NO2 and a molecular weight of 207.27. The CAS Registry Number is 29342-05-0. The chemical structure is:</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>CNL8 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h2>PHARMACOKINETICS</h2><p class="First">As demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies in animals and man, ciclopirox olamine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and completely eliminated in all species via feces and urine. Most of the compound is excreted either unchanged or as glucuronide. After oral administration of 10 mg of radiolabeled drug (14Cciclopirox) to healthy volunteers, approximately 96% of the radioactivity was excreted renally within 12 hours of administration. Ninety four percent of the renally excreted radioactivity was in the form of glucuronides. Thus, glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway of this compound.</p><h2>INDICATIONS &amp; USAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(To understand fully the indication for this product, please read the entire INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the labeling.)</span></p><p>CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution,8%) nail lacquer as a component of a comprehensive management program, is indicated as topical treatment in immunocompetent patients with mild to moderate onychomycosis of fingernails and toenails without lunula involvement, due to Tricho-phyto rubrum. The comprehensive management program includes removal of the unattached, infected nails as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional who has special competence in the diagnosis and treatment of nail disorders, including minor nail procedures.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The results of use of CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the US. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator.  CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20-65% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint “complete cure” (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint “almost clear” (10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study. These results are presented below.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer is not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. For use on nails and immediately adjacent skin only.<br/></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur with the use of CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. So far there is no relevant clinical experience with patients with insulin dependent diabetes or who have diabetic neuropathy. The risk of removal of the unattached, infected nail, by the health care professional and trimming by the patient should be carefully considered before prescribing to patients with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or diabetic neuropathy.<br/></p><h2>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h2><p class="First">Patients should have detailed instruction regarding the use of CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis in order to achieve maximum benefit with the use of this product.<br/></p><p>The patient should be told to:</p><h2>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS and IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h2><p class="First">No carcinogenicity study was conducted with CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer formulation. A carcinogenicity study of ciclopirox (1% and 5% solutions in polyethylene glycol 400) in female mice dosed topically twice per week for 50 weeks followed by a 6-month drug-free observation period prior to necropsy revealed no evidence of tumors at the application sites.</p><p>In human systemic tolerability studies following daily application (~340 mg of CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer) in subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis, the average maximal serum level of ciclopirox was 31±28 ng/mL after two months of once daily applications. This level was 159 times lower than the lowest toxic dose and 115 times lower than the highest nontoxic dose in rats and dogs fed 7.7 and 23.1 mg ciclopirox (as ciclopirox olamine)/kg/day.</p><p>The following in vitro genotoxicity tests have been conducted with ciclopirox: evaluation of gene mutation in Ames Salmonella and E. coli assays (negative); chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, with and without metabolic activation (positive); gene mutation assay in HGPRT-test with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (negative); unscheduled DNA synthesis in human A549 cells (negative); and BALB/c3T3 cell transformation assay (negative). In an in vivo Chinese hamster bone marrow cytogenetic assay, ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at 5,000 mg/kg.</p><h2>PREGNANCY</h2><h2>NURSING MONTHERS</h2><h2>PEDIATRIC USE</h2><h2>GERIATRIC USE</h2><h2>ADVERSE REATIONS</h2><p class="First">In the vehicle-controlled clinical trials conducted in the US, 9% (30/327) of patients treated with CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer and 7% (23/328) of patients treated with vehicle reported treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAE) considered by the investigator to be causally related to the test material. The incidence of these adverse events, within each body system, was similar between the treatment groups except for Skin and Appendages: 8% (27/327) and 4% (14/328) of subjects in the ciclopirox and vehicle groups reported at least one adverse event, respectively. The most common were rash-related adverse<br/>
events: periungual erythema and erythema of the proximal nail fold were reported more frequently in patients treated with CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer (5% [16/327]) than in patients treated with vehicle (1% [3/328]). Other TEAEs thought to be causally related included nail disorders such as shape change, irritation, ingrown toenail, and discoloration.</p><h2>DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION</h2><h2>How is CNL8 Supplied</h2><p class="First">CNL8 nail kit (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%), Swabplus nail lacquer remover, emery board – which contains 3 - 5 ml bottles of CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer (glass bottles with screw caps which are fitted with brushes), 25 - 0.15 ml nail lacquer remover swabs and 1 emery board (NDC 68712-027-01).<br/></p><p>CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer, single count 5 ml bottle (NDC 68712-027-03).<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Protect from light (e.g., store the bottle in the carton after every use).</span></p><p>CNL8 (ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) nail lacquer should be stored at room temperature between 59° and 86° F (15° and 30° C).</p><h2>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h2><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>More about CNL8 Nail (ciclopirox topical)</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
