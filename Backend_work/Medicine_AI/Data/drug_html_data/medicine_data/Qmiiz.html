Although this is rare, it may occur often in patients who are allergic to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Other signs may include changes in skin color of the face, very fast but irregular heartbeat or pulse, hive-like swellings on the skin, puffiness or swelling of the eyelids or around the eyes. If these effects occur, get emergency help at once. Ask someone to drive you to the nearest hospital emergency room. Call an ambulance, lie down, cover yourself to keep warm, and prop your feet higher than your head. Stay in that position until help arrives.</p><p>Serious skin reactions can occur during treatment with this medicine.
