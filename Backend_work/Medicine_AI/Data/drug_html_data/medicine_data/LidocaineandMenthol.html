Management: Use of stiripentol with CYP3A4 substrates that are considered to have a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided due to the increased risk for adverse effects and toxicity.  Any CYP3A4 substrate used with stiripentol requires closer monitoring.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Also see Lidocaine monograph.</p><p>Frequency not defined:</p><p>Central nervous system: Burning sensation, localized warm feeling, paresthesia (localized), stinging sensation</p><p>Dermatologic: Localized erythema</p><p>Local: Localized edema</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Use with caution in patients with known drug sensitivities. Allergic reactions (cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema, or anaphylactoid reactions) may be a result of sensitivity to lidocaine (rare) or preservatives used in formulations. Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (eg, procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine.</p><p>• Local effects: Irritation, sensitivity, and/or infection may occur at the site of application; discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy if local effects occur.</p><p>• Methemoglobinemia: Has been reported with local anesthetics; clinically significant methemoglobinemia requires immediate treatment along with discontinuation of the anesthetic and other oxidizing agents. Onset may be immediate or delayed (hours) after anesthetic exposure. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites, or infants &lt;6 months of age are more susceptible and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (eg, cyanosis, headache, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue).</p><p>• Systemic adverse effects: Potentially life-threatening side effects (eg, irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma, respiratory depression, death) have occurred when lidocaine is used prior to cosmetic procedures. Excessive dosing for any indication (eg, application to large areas, use above recommended dose, application to denuded or inflamed skin, applying longer than recommended), smaller patients, and/or impaired elimination may lead to increased absorption and systemic toxicity. Patient should adhere strictly to recommended dosage and administration guidelines; serious adverse effects may require the use of supportive care and resuscitative equipment; lidocaine toxicity may occur at blood concentrations &gt;5 mcg/mL.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Acutely ill patients: Use with caution; acutely ill patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.</p><p>• Debilitated patients: Use with caution; debilitated patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.</p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution; elderly patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use caution in patients with severe hepatic disease due to diminished ability to metabolize systemically absorbed lidocaine.</p><p>• Pediatric: Use with caution; children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol and/or sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity ("gasping syndrome") in neonates; the "gasping syndrome" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggest that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol and/or benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Topical gel (Rx): Avoid exposing application site to external heat sources (eg, heating pad, electric blanket). Keep away from open flame and do not heat, microwave, or add to hot water; flammable.</p><p>• Topical patch: Avoid exposing application site to external heat sources (eg, heating pad, electric blanket, heat lamp, hot tub).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Self-medication (OTC use): When used for self-medication, discontinue use and contact health care provider if symptoms persist &gt;7 days, condition worsens or recurs, or if rash, irritation, or itching develops. Do not use on open wounds, cuts, damaged or infected skin; in the eyes, mouth, genitals; or any other mucous membranes. Do not use in large quantities, particularly over raw or blistered areas. Some products are not recommended for use with bandages; consult specific product labeling.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
