Treatment of anaphylaxis (eg, epinephrine) in patients taking beta-blockers may be ineffective or promote undesirable effects.</p><p>• Bacterial keratitis: Inadvertent contamination of multiple-dose ophthalmic solutions has caused bacterial keratitis.</p><p>• Ocular effects: Local ocular adverse effects (conjunctivitis and lid reactions) were reported with chronic administration; many resolved upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Choroidal detachment has been reported after filtration procedures. Patients with low endothelial cell counts may have increased risk for corneal edema; use caution.</p><p>• Sulfonamide (“sulfa”) allergy: Dorzolamide is a sulfonamide; although administered ocularly, systemic absorption may occur and could result in hypersensitivity. Discontinue use if signs of hypersensitivity or a serious reaction occur.</p><p>• Systemic effects: Systemic absorption and adverse effects (similar to sulfonamides) including blood dyscrasias, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and fulminant hepatic necrosis may occur with ophthalmic use.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; may potentiate hypoglycemia and/or mask signs and symptoms.</p><p>• Heart failure (HF): Use with caution in patients with compensated heart failure and monitor for a worsening of the condition; control heart failure prior to initiation of therapy.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; not evaluated.</p><p>• Myasthenia gravis: Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis; may worsen disease or other myasthenic symptoms (diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness).</p><p>• Narrow-angle glaucoma: Use is not recommended in narrow-angle glaucoma (has not been studied).</p><p>• Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and Raynaud's disease: Can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with PVD and Raynaud's disease. Use with caution and monitor for progression of arterial obstruction.</p><p>• Psychiatric disease: Use with caution in patients with a history of psychiatric illness; may cause or exacerbate CNS depression.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; not recommended with severe impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/minute).</p><p>• Respiratory disease: In general, patients with mild-to-moderate COPD or bronchospastic disease should not receive beta-blockers; if used at all, should be used cautiously with close monitoring. Use is contraindicated in patients with asthma or severe COPD.</p><p>• Thyroid disease: May mask signs of hyperthyroidism (eg, tachycardia). If thyrotoxicosis is suspected, carefully manage and monitor; abrupt withdrawal may exacerbate symptoms of hyperthyroidism or precipitate thyroid storm.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Contact lens wearers: Some products may contain benzalkonium chloride which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses; remove lens prior to administration and wait 15 minutes before reinserting.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Surgery: May block systemic effects of beta agonists (eg, epinephrine, norepinephrine); notify anesthesiologist if patient is receiving ophthalmic beta blocker therapy. Patients undergoing planned major surgery should be gradually tapered off therapy (if possible) prior to procedure. If necessary during surgery, effects of beta blocker therapy may be reversed by adrenergic agonists.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Ophthalmic exams and IOP periodically</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
