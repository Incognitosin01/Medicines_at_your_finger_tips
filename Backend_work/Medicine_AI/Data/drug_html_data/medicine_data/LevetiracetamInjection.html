<br/>
There is no clinical study experience with administration of intravenous levetiracetam for a period longer than 4 days.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Adults 16 Years of Age and Older</span></p><p>Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit.</p><p><br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>1 Month to &lt; 6 Months</p><p>Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group.</p><p>6 Months to &lt; 4 Years</p><p>Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group.</p><p>4 Years to &lt; 16 Years</p><p>Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily).

The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied.</p><h3>Switching from Oral Dosing</h3><p class="First">When switching from oral levetiracetam, the initial total daily intravenous dosage of levetiracetam should be equivalent to the total daily dosage and frequency of oral levetiracetam.</p><h3>Switching to Oral Dosing</h3><p class="First">At the end of the intravenous treatment period, the patient may be switched to levetiracetam oral administration at the equivalent daily dosage and frequency of the intravenous administration.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam Injection is for intravenous use only and should be diluted in 100 mL of a compatible diluent prior to administration. If a smaller volume is required (e.g. pediatric patients), the amount of diluent should be calculated to not exceed a maximum levetiracetam concentration of 15 mg per mL of diluted solution. Consideration should also be given to the total daily fluid intake of the patient. Levetiracetam Injection should be administered as a 15-minute IV infusion. One vial of Levetiracetam Injection contains 500 mg levetiracetam (500 mg/5 mL).</p><p>Levetiracetam Injection may be mixed with the following diluents and antiepileptic drugs and may be stored in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags. The diluted solution should not be stored for more than 4 hours at controlled room temperature [15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F)].</p><p><span class="Bold">Diluents:</span></p><p>Sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s injection</p><p>Dextrose 5% injection, USP</p><p><span class="Bold">Other Antiepileptic Drugs:</span></p><p>Lorazepam</p><p>Diazepam</p><p>Valproate sodium</p><p>There are no data to support the physical compatibility of Levetiracetam Injection with antiepileptic drugs that are not listed above.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Product with particulate matter or discoloration should not be used.</p><p>Any unused portion of the Levetiracetam Injection vial contents should be discarded.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>See Table 1 for the recommended preparation and administration of Levetiracetam Injection for adults to achieve a dose of 500 mg, 1000 mg, or 1500 mg.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Preparation and Administration of Levetiracetam Injection for Adults</span></p><p>For example, to prepare a 1000 mg dose, dilute 10 mL of Levetiracetam Injection in 100 mL of a compatible diluent and administer intravenously as a 15-minute infusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>When using Levetiracetam Injection for pediatric patients, dosing is weight-based (mg per kg).</p><p>The following calculation should be used to determine the appropriate daily dose of Levetiracetam Injection for pediatric patients:</p><p>                                              Daily dose (mg/kg/day) x patient weight (kg)</p><p>Total daily dose (mL/day) = -------------------------------------------------------­</p><p>                                                                        100 mg/mL</p><h3>Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults with renal impairment are shown in Table 2. Information is unavailable for dosage adjustments in pediatric patients with renal impairment. In order to calculate the dose recommended for adult patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient’s creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:</p><p>CLcr=         [140-age (years)] x weight (kg)        (x 0.85 for female  patients)</p><p>                 -----------------------------------------</p><p>                       72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)   </p><p>Then, CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:</p><p>                                         CLcr (mL/min)</p><p>CLcr (mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>)= ------------------------ x 1.73</p><p>                                        BSA subject (m<span class="Sup">2</span>)</p><p><br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 2: Dosage Adjustment Regimen for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p><span class="Sup">1</span>Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Levetiracetam</h3><p class="First">Avoid abrupt withdrawal from levetiracetam in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].</span></p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">One vial of Levetiracetam Injection contains 500 mg levetiracetam (500 mg/5 mL).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Levetiracetam is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to levetiracetam<span class="Italics">.</span> Reactions have included anaphylaxis and angioedema <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Behavioral Abnormalities and Psychotic Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam may cause behavioral abnormalities and psychotic symptoms. Patients treated with levetiracetam should be monitored for psychiatric signs and symptoms.</p><p><span class="Bold">Behavioral abnormalities</span></p><p>In clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam, 13% of adult levetiracetam-treated patients and 38% of pediatric levetiracetam-treated patients (4 to 16 years of age), compared to 6% and 19% of adult and pediatric placebo-treated patients, experienced non-psychotic behavioral symptoms (reported as aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, neurosis, and personality disorder).</p><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age). The results from an exploratory analysis indicated a worsening in levetiracetam-treated patients on aggressive behavior (one of eight behavior dimensions), as measured in a standardized and systematic way using a validated instrument, the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6 to 18).</p><p>In clinical studies in pediatric patients 1 month to &lt; 4 years of age, irritability was reported in 12% of the levetiracetam-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p>In clinical studies, 1.7% of adult levetiracetam-treated patients discontinued treatment due to behavioral adverse reactions, compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The treatment dose was reduced in 0.8% of adult levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.5% of placebo- treated patients. Overall, 11% of levetiracetam-treated pediatric patients experienced behavioral symptoms associated with discontinuation or dose reduction, compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Psychotic symptoms</span></p><p>In clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam, 1% of levetiracetam-treated adult patients, 2% of levetiracetam-treated pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age, and 17% of levetiracetam-treated pediatric patients 1 month to &lt;4 years of age experienced psychotic symptoms, compared to 0.2%, 2%, and 5% in the corresponding age groups treated with placebo. In a controlled study that assessed the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of levetiracetam in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age, 1.6% of levetiracetam- treated patients experienced paranoia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In the same study, 3.1% of levetiracetam-treated patients experienced confusional state, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p>In clinical studies, two (0.3%) levetiracetam -treated adult patients were hospitalized, and their treatment was discontinued due to psychosis. Both events, reported as psychosis, developed within the first week of treatment and resolved within 1 to 2 weeks following treatment discontinuation. There was no difference between drug- and placebo-treated patients in the incidence of the pediatric patients who discontinued treatment due to psychotic and non-psychotic adverse reactions.</p><h3>Somnolence and Fatigue</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam may cause somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be monitored for somnolence and fatigue, and be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on levetiracetam to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.</p><p><span class="Bold">Somnolence</span></p><p>In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of levetiracetam-treated patients reported somnolence, compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. There was no clear dose response up to 3000 mg/day. In a study in which there was no titration, about 45% of patients receiving levetiracetam 4000 mg/day reported somnolence. The somnolence was considered serious in 0.3% of levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to 0% in the placebo group. About 3% of levetiracetam-treated patients discontinued treatment due to somnolence, compared to 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. In 1.4% of levetiracetam-treated patients and 0.9% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced, while 0.3% of the levetiracetam-treated patients were hospitalized due to somnolence.</p><p><span class="Bold">Asthenia</span></p><p>In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 15% of levetiracetam-treated patients reported asthenia, compared to 9% of placebo-treated patients. Treatment was discontinued due to asthenia in 0.8% of levetiracetam-treated patients as compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.5% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo- treated patients, the dose was reduced due to asthenia.</p><p>Somnolence and asthenia occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment. In general, the incidences of somnolence and fatigue in the pediatric partial-onset seizure studies, and in pediatric and adult myoclonic and primary generalized tonic-clonic studies were comparable to those of the adult partial-onset seizure studies.</p><h3>Anaphylaxis and Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam can cause anaphylaxis or angioedema after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Signs and symptoms in cases reported in the postmarketing setting have included hypotension, hives, rash, respiratory distress, and swelling of the face, lip, mouth, eye, tongue, throat, and feet. In some reported cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema, levetiracetam should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical attention. Levetiracetam should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Serious Dermatological Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in both pediatric and adult patients treated with levetiracetam. The median time of onset is reported to be 14 to 17 days, but cases have been reported at least four months after initiation of treatment. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with levetiracetam has also been reported.  Levetiracetam should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.</p><h3>Coordination Difficulties</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam may cause coordination difficulties.</p><p>In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, 3.4% of levetiracetam-treated patients experienced coordination difficulties, (reported as ataxia, abnormal gait, or incoordination) compared to 1.6% of placebo-treated patients. A total of 0.4% of patients in controlled clinical studies discontinued levetiracetam treatment due to ataxia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.7% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to coordination difficulties, while one of the treated patients was hospitalized due to worsening of pre-existing ataxia. These events occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of coordination difficulties and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on levetiracetam to gauge whether it could adversely affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.</p><h3>Withdrawal Seizures</h3><p class="First">As with most antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. But if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.</p><h3>Hematologic Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cells counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.</p><p><span class="Bold">Partial-Onset Seizures</span></p><p>Adults</p><p>In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 x 10<span class="Sup">6</span>/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients.</p><p>A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤2.8 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤1.0 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.</p><p>Pediatric Patients 4 Years to &lt; 16 Years</p><p>In a controlled study in pediatric patients age 4 years to &lt;16 years, statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients, as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the levetiracetam-treated group were -0.4× 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L and -0.3 × 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo-treated patients (statistically significant).</p><p>More levetiracetam-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients); however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% on levetiracetam versus 4.2% on placebo). No patient was discontinued because of low WBC or neutrophil count.</p><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of an oral formulation of levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age), 5 patients (8.6%) in the levetiracetam-treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥10% or ≥0.7X10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L).</p><h3>Increase in Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to &lt;4 years of age using an oral formulation of levetiracetam, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the levetiracetam-treated patients (17%), compared to placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older children or in adults.</p><p>Monitor patients 1 month to &lt;4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.</p><h3>Seizure Control During Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in more details in other sections of labeling:</p><ul>

Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent C<span class="Sub">max</span>, C<span class="Sub">min</span>, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Partial-Onset Seizures</span></p><p>Adults</p><p>In controlled clinical studies using levetiracetam tablets in adults with partial-onset seizures <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)],</span> the most common adverse reactions in adult patients receiving levetiracetam in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness. Of the most common adverse reactions in adults experiencing partial-onset seizures, asthenia, somnolence, and dizziness occurred predominantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with levetiracetam.</p><p>Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving levetiracetam tablets in placebo-controlled studies and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo.

Cases of somnolence, agitation, aggression, depressed level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and coma were observed with levetiracetam overdoses in postmarketing use.</p><h3>Management of Overdose</h3><p class="First">There is no specific antidote for overdose with levetiracetam. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the patient’s clinical status. A Certified Poison Control Center should be contacted for up to date information on the management of overdose with levetiracetam.</p><h3>Hemodialysis</h3><p class="First">Standard hemodialysis procedures result in significant clearance of levetiracetam (approximately 50% in 4 hours) and should be considered in cases of overdose.

The chemical name of levetiracetam, a single enantiomer, is (-)-(S)-α-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide, its molecular formula is C <span class="Sub">8</span>H <span class="Sub">14</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>O <span class="Sub">2</span> and its molecular weight is 170.21. Levetiracetam is chemically unrelated to existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). It has the following structural formula:<br/>
</p><p>Levetiracetam is a white to off-white crystalline powder with a faint odor and a bitter taste. It is very soluble in water (104.0 g/100 mL). It is freely soluble in chloroform (65.3 g/100 mL) and in methanol (53.6 g/100 mL), soluble in ethanol (16.5 g/100 mL), sparingly soluble in acetonitrile (5.7 g/100 mL) and practically insoluble in n-hexane. (Solubility limits are expressed as g/100 mL solvent.)</p><p>Levetiracetam Injection, USP contains 100 mg of levetiracetam per mL. It is supplied in single-use 5 mL vials containing 500 mg levetiracetam, water for injection, 45 mg sodium chloride, and buffered at approximately pH 5.5 with glacial acetic acid and 8.2 mg sodium acetate trihydrate.</p><p>Levetiracetam Injection, USP must be diluted prior to intravenous infusion [ <span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.6)</span>].</p><h2>Levetiracetam Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on QTc Interval</span></p><p>The effect of levetiracetam on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled crossover study of levetiracetam (1000 mg or 5000 mg) in 52 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 milliseconds. Therefore, there was no evidence of significant QTc prolongation in this study.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) levetiracetam and oral levetiracetam result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to levetiracetam when the IV levetiracetam is administered as a 15-minute infusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Overview</span>Levetiracetam is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Levetiracetam Injection and tablets are bioequivalent. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (&lt;10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. It is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with renal impairment.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span>The equivalence of Levetiracetam Injection and the oral formulation was demonstrated in a bioavailability study of 17 healthy volunteers. In this study, levetiracetam 1500 mg was diluted in 100 mL 0.9% sterile saline solution and was infused over 15 minutes. The selected infusion rate provided plasma concentrations of levetiracetam at the end of the infusion period similar to those achieved at T <span class="Sub">max</span> after an equivalent oral dose. It is demonstrated that levetiracetam 1500 mg intravenous infusion is equivalent to levetiracetam 3 x 500 mg oral tablets. The time independent pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam was demonstrated following 1500 mg intravenous infusion for 4 days with BID dosing. The AUC <span class="Sub">(0 to 12)</span> at steady-state was equivalent to AUC <span class="Sub">inf</span> following an equivalent single dose.</p><p>Levetiracetam and its major metabolite are less than 10% bound to plasma proteins; clinically significant interactions with other drugs through competition for protein binding sites are therefore unlikely.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring (2% of dose) and opening of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring in position 5 (1% of dose).  There is no enantiomeric interconversion of levetiracetam or its major metabolite.<span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7±1 hour and is unaffected by either dose, route of administration or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see  Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Elderly</span>Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61to 88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></p><ul>
<li>Intravenous Formulation</li>
</ul><p>A population pharmacokinetic analysis for the intravenous formulation was conducted in 49 pediatric patients (1 month to &lt; 16 years of age) weighing 3 to 79 kg. Patients received levetiracetam as a 15-minute IV infusion at doses between 14 mg/kg/day and 60 mg/kg/day twice daily. Plasma concentrations and model derived steady-state exposure AUC <span class="Sub">(0 to 12)</span> were within the range of the exposure observed in pediatric patients receiving equivalent doses of the oral solution.</p><ul>
<li>Oral Formulations</li>
</ul><p>Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were evaluated in 24 pediatric patients (age 6 to 12 years) after single oral dose (20 mg/kg) of the immediate release formulation of levetiracetam. The body weight adjusted apparent clearance of levetiracetam was approximately 40% higher than in adults.</p><p>A repeat dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in pediatric patients (age 4 to 12 years) at doses of 20 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day, and 60 mg/kg/day of the immediate release formulation of levetiracetam. The evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam and its metabolite (ucb L057) in 14 pediatric patients demonstrated rapid absorption of levetiracetam at all doses, with a T <span class="Sub">max</span> of about 1 hour and a t <span class="Sub">1/2</span> of 5 hours across all dosing levels. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam in pediatric patients was linear between 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. The potential interaction of levetiracetam with other AEDs was also evaluated in these patients. Levetiracetam had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate or lamotrigine. However, there was about a 22% increase of apparent clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with an enzyme-inducing AED (e.g., carbamazepine).</p><p>Following single dose administration (20 mg/kg) of a 10% oral solution to pediatric patients with epilepsy (1 month to &lt; 4 years), levetiracetam was rapidly absorbed and peak plasma concentrations were observed approximately 1 hour after dosing. Levetiracetam half-life in pediatric patients 1 month to &lt; 4 years with epilepsy was shorter (5.3 h) than in adults (7.2 h), and apparent clearance (1.5 mL/min/kg) was faster than in adults (0.96 mL/min/kg).</p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that body weight was significantly correlated to the clearance of levetiracetam in pediatric patients; clearance increased with an increase in body weight.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy</span></p><p>Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see  Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Gender</span></p><p>Levetiracetam C <span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were 20% higher in women (N=11) compared to men (N=12). However, clearances adjusted for body weight were comparable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Race</span></p><p>Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted. Cross-study comparisons involving Caucasians (N=12) and Asians (N=12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The disposition of levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr &lt;30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance.</p><p>In anuric (end stage renal disease) patients, the total body clearance decreased 70% compared to normal subjects (CLcr &gt;80mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4 hour hemodialysis procedure <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>In vitro data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above Cmax levels achieved within the therapeutic dose range, are neither inhibitors of, nor high affinity substrates for, human liver cytochrome P450 isoforms, epoxide hydrolase or UDP-glucuronidation enzymes. In addition, levetiracetam does not affect the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> glucuronidation of valproic acid.<br/>
<br/>
Potential pharmacokinetic interactions of or with levetiracetam were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptive, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in epilepsy patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Phenytoin</span></p><p>Levetiracetam (3000 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of phenytoin in patients with refractory epilepsy. Pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were also not affected by phenytoin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Valproate</span></p><p>Levetiracetam (1500 mg twice daily) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of valproate in healthy volunteers. Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057.</p><p><span class="Italics">Other Antiepileptic Drugs</span></p><p>Potential drug interactions between levetiracetam and other AEDs (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and valproate) were also assessed by evaluating the serum concentrations of levetiracetam and these AEDs during placebo- controlled clinical studies. These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of AEDs in Pediatric Patients</span></p><p>There was about a 22% increase of apparent total body clearance of levetiracetam when it was co-administered with enzyme-inducing AEDs. Dose adjustment is not recommended. Levetiracetam had no effect on plasma concentrations of carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, or lamotrigine.</p><p><span class="Italics">Oral Contraceptives</span></p><p>Levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digoxin</span></p><p>Levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (ECG) of digoxin given as a 0.25 mg dose every day. Coadministration of digoxin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Italics">Warfarin</span>Levetiracetam (1000 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of R and S warfarin. Prothrombin time was not affected by levetiracetam. Coadministration of warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.</p><p><span class="Italics">Probenecid</span></p><p>Probenecid, a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day, did not change the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily.

Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of probenecid decreased 60%, probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057. The effect of levetiracetam on probenecid was not studied.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Rats were dosed with levetiracetam in the diet for 104 weeks at doses of 50, 300, and 1800 mg/kg/day.

The tablet formulation was used in all these studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, 1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day.  Patients enrolled in Study 1 or Study 2 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more classical AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one classical AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.</p><p>Study 1</p><p>Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States comparing levetiracetam 1000 mg/day (N=97), levetiracetam 3000 mg/day (N=101), and placebo (N=95) given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency).

Study 4 was conducted at 60 sites in North America. The study consisted of an 8-week baseline period and 4-week titration period followed by a 10-week evaluation period. Eligible patients who still experienced, on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, at least 4 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening, as well as at least 4 partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods, were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. Dosing was initiated at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, levetiracetam doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments, at 2-week intervals to the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire 14-week randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial- onset seizure frequency per week).

Study 5 was conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe. Study 5 consisted of a 5-day evaluation period, which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Eligible patients who experienced, on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either  levetiracetam  or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N=4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N=8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N=20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N=28 treated with levetiracetam). Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of efficacy was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N=60, placebo N=56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed in Study 5 (see Figure 5).

Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day over 12 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 divided doses. The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in the number of days per week with one or more myoclonic seizures during the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods) as compared to baseline.

Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) experiencing at least 3 PGTC seizures during the 8-week combined baseline period (at least one PGTC seizure during the 4 weeks prior to the prospective baseline period and at least one PGTC seizure during the 4-week prospective baseline period) were randomized to either levetiracetam or placebo. The 8-week combined baseline period is referred to as “baseline” in the remainder of this section. Patients were titrated over 4 weeks to a target dose of 3000 mg/day for adults or a pediatric target dose of 60 mg/kg/day and treated at a stable dose of 3000 mg/day (or 60 mg/kg/day for children) over 20 weeks (evaluation period). Study drug was given in 2 equally divided doses per day. The primary measure of efficacy was the percent reduction from baseline in weekly PGTC seizure frequency for levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups over the treatment period (titration + evaluation periods).
