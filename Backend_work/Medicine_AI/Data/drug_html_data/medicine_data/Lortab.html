An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. Acetaminophen, also called Tylenol, is a less potent pain reliever that increases the effects of hydrocodone.</p><p>Lortab is used to relieve moderate to severe pain.</p><p>Lortab may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Hydrocodone can slow or stop your breathing.</b> Never use Lortab in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. <b>Narcotic pain medicine may be habit-forming, even at regular doses.</b> Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it.</p><p><b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Do not use Lortab if you have used a MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days, such as isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, or tranylcypromine.</p><p><b>An overdose of acetaminophen can damage your liver or cause death.</b> Call your doctor at once if you have nausea, pain in your upper stomach, itching, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, or jaundice (yellowing of your skin or eyes).</p><p><b>Stop taking Lortab and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling.</b></p><h2>Before taking Lortab</h2><p>You should not use Lortab if you are allergic to acetaminophen (Tylenol) or hydrocodone, or if you have recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, or other narcotic medications.</p><p>Do not use Lortab if you have taken a MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.</p><p>Some medicines can interact with hydrocodone and cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Be sure your doctor knows if you also take medicine for depression, mental illness, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting. Ask your doctor before making any changes in how or when you take your medications.</p><p>To make sure Lortab is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>

Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>Acetaminophen and hydrocodone can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while using Lortab.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Lortab?</h2><p>Take Lortab exactly as prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Never take this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. An overdose can damage your liver or cause death. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Hydrocodone may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away Lortab is against the law.</p><p>Measure liquid Lortab with the dosing syringe provided, or with a special dose-measuring spoon or medicine cup. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.</p><p>If you need surgery or medical tests, tell the doctor ahead of time that you are using Lortab. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time.</p><p>Do not stop using Lortab suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Hydrocodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Always check your bottle to make sure you have received the correct pills (same brand and type) of medicine prescribed by your doctor.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Lortab is taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. If you are taking the medication regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An overdose of acetaminophen and hydrocodone can be fatal.</b></p><p>The first signs of an acetaminophen overdose include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, sweating, and confusion or weakness. Later symptoms may include pain in your upper stomach, dark urine, and yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may also include extreme drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, cold and clammy skin, muscle weakness, fainting, weak pulse, slow heart rate, coma, blue lips, shallow breathing, or no breathing</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>This medication may impair your thinking or reactions. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Lortab will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other cold, allergy, pain, or sleep medication. Acetaminophen (sometimes abbreviated as APAP) is contained in many combination medicines. <b>Taking certain products together can cause you to get too much acetaminophen which can lead to a fatal overdose.</b> Check the label to see if a medicine contains acetaminophen or APAP.</p><p>Avoid drinking alcohol. It may increase your risk of liver damage while taking acetaminophen.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Lortab side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Lortab:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>In rare cases, acetaminophen may cause a severe skin reaction that can be fatal.</b> This could occur even if you have taken acetaminophen in the past and had no reaction. <b>Stop taking Lortab and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling.</b> If you have this type of reaction, you should never again take any medicine that contains acetaminophen.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
