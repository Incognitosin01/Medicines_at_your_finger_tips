<li><span class="Bold">NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Flurbiprofen Tablets</h2><p class="First">Flurbiprofen Tablets are indicated:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
<li>For relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis.</li>
</ul><h2>Flurbiprofen Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Flurbiprofen Tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use Flurbiprofen Tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5)</span>].</p><p>After observing the response to initial therapy with Flurbiprofen Tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.</p><p>For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, the dosage is 200 to 300 mg per day, divided for administration two, three, or four times a day. The largest recommended single dose in a multiple-dose daily regimen is 100 mg.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Flurbiprofen Tablets USP: 100 mg round, blue, film-coated tablets debossed “93”-“711”</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Flurbiprofen Tablets are contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to flurbiprofen or any components of the drug product [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.9)</span>]</li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been reported in such patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)</span>].</li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as flurbiprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="following_xmChange">)].<br/>
<span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span><br/>
Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (</span>4<span class="following_xmChange">)].<br/></span> <span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span><br/>
Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Avoid the use of flurbiprofen in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If flurbiprofen is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</span></p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-times increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:</span></p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue flurbiprofen until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including flurbiprofen.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue flurbiprofen immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (5.1, 7)</span>].</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of flurbiprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (</span>7<span class="following_xmChange">)].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Avoid the use of flurbiprofen in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If flurbiprofen is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure</span>.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>In clinical studies, the elimination half-life of flurbiprofen was unchanged in patients with renal impairment. Flurbiprofen metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. Elimination of 4’hydroxy-flurbiprofen was reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Therefore, treatment with flurbiprofen is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If flurbiprofen therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12)</span>].</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating flurbiprofen. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of flurbiprofen [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Avoid the use of flurbiprofen in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If flurbiprofen is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Flurbiprofen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to flurbiprofen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, flurbiprofen is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. When flurbiprofen is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of flurbiprofen at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Flurbiprofen is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Flurbiprofen may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with flurbiprofen has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.</p><p>NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders of concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of flurbiprofen in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)</span>].</p><h3>Vision changes</h3><p class="First">Blurred and/or diminished vision has been reported with the use of flurbiprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients experiencing eye complaints should have ophthalmologic examinations.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">

<li>Flurbiprofen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of flurbiprofen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.</li>
<li>Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.</li>

Use of NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of flurbiprofen in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryo-fetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2 to 4% for major malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies, delayed parturition, prolonged labor, stillborn fetuses, and the presence of retained fetuses at necropsy occurred following treatment of pregnant rats treated with oral flurbiprofen throughout gestation until labor at less than 1-time the human dose of 300 mg/day. Embryofetal lethality was seen in pregnant rats and rabbits administered oral flurbiprofen during the period of organogenesis at exposures 0.03-times and 0.5 times, respectively, the human dose of 300 mg. No evidence of malformations were noted in rats, rabbits, or mice treated with flurbiprofen during the period of organogenesis at doses that were 0.8-, 0.5-, and 0.2-times the maximum human daily dose [see Data]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as flurbiprofen, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span><br/>
There are no studies on the effects of flurbiprofen during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including flurbiprofen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Animal data</span><br/>
Pregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 0.05, 1, and 3 mg/kg flurbiprofen 14 days prior to mating through Gestation Day (GD) 16. Embryofetal lethality was seen at 1 mg/kg and above (0.03 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 300 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). No maternal toxicity was evident at this dose. No malformations were seen in fetuses from pregnant rats administered flurbiprofen during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg (0.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Maternal toxicity (uterine hemorrhage, gastric ulcers) was observed at this dose.</p><p>Pregnant rabbits were administered oral doses of 0.675, 2.25, and 7.5 mg/kg flurbiprofen from GD 1 through GD 29. Embryofetal lethality, but no evidence of teratogenicity, was seen at 7.5 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD of 300 mg on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Maternal toxicity (gastric ulcers and lethality) was observed at this dose.</p><p>Pregnant mice were treated with oral doses of 2, 5, and 12 mg/kg flurbiprofen from GD 3 to 18. An increased incidence of fetal lethality occurred in the 12 mg/kg group (0.2 times the MRHD). All doses were associated with some evidence of maternal toxicity (placental hemorrhage).</p><p>Pregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 0.2, 0.675, 2.25, 7.5, and 25 mg/kg flurbiprofen from GD 1 until labor. Delayed delivery, the incidence of stillborn pups, and decreased pup viability, were noted at doses of 2.25 mg/kg and higher (0.07 times the MRHD). These doses were associated with maternal toxicity (uterine hemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulceration, decreased body weight).</p><p>Pregnant rats treated with oral doses of 0.4, 4, and 10 mg/kg flurbiprofen from GD 16 to labor, delayed parturition was seen at 0.4 mg/kg and above and stillborn pups were seen at 4 mg/kg and above (0.01-times and 0.13 times, respectively, the MRHD on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Uterine hemorrhage, ulceration, and mortality were noted in dams at 0.4 mg/kg and above.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Flurbiprofen is poorly excreted into human milk. The nursing infant dose is predicted to be approximately 0.1 mg/day in the established milk of a woman taking flurbiprofen 200 mg/day. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for flurbiprofen and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from flurbiprofen or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Females</span><br/>
Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including flurbiprofen, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma have occurred, but were rare [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)</span>].</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>Flurbiprofen Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Flurbiprofen Tablets USP are a member of the phenylalkanoic acid derivative group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Flurbiprofen Tablets USP are round, blue, film-coated debossed “93” – “711” tablets for oral administration. Flurbiprofen, USP is a racemic mixture of (+)S- and (-)R- enantiomers. Flurbiprofen, USP is a white or slightly yellow crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in water at pH 7.0 and readily soluble in most polar solvents. The chemical name is [1,1’-biphenyl]-4-acetic acid,2-fluoro-α-methyl-, (±)-. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 100 mg flurbiprofen, USP. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, titanium dioxide, and FD&amp;C Blue #1 aluminum lake.</p><h2>Flurbiprofen Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Flurbiprofen has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</p><p>The mechanism of action of flurbiprofen, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</p><p>Flurbiprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in vitro. Flurbiprofen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because flurbiprofen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General pharmacokinetic characteristics</span><br/>
The pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen have been characterized in healthy subjects, special populations and patients (see Table 2). The pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen are linear, and there is little accumulation of flurbiprofen following multiple doses of flurbiprofen.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetic Parameter</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Normal Healthy Adults</span>* <span class="Bold"><br/>

The mean oral bioavailability of flurbiprofen from Flurbiprofen Tablets 100 mg is 96% relative to an oral solution. Flurbiprofen is rapidly and non-stereoselectively absorbed from flurbiprofen, with peak plasma concentrations occurring at approximately 2 hours (see Table 2).</p><p>Administration of flurbiprofen with either food or antacids may alter the rate but not the extent of flurbiprofen absorption. Ranitidine has been shown to have no effect on either the rate or extent of flurbiprofen absorption from flurbiprofen.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span><br/>
The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of both R- and S-flurbiprofen is approximately 0.12 L/kg. Both flurbiprofen enantiomers are more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Plasma protein binding is relatively constant for the typical average steady-state concentrations (≤ 10 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses. Flurbiprofen is poorly excreted into human milk. The nursing infant dose is predicted to be approximately 0.1 mg/day in the established milk of a woman taking flurbiprofen 200 mg/day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span><br/>
Several flurbiprofen metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. These metabolites include 4’-hydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3’, 4’-dihydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3’-hydroxy-4’-methoxy-flurbiprofen, their conjugates, and conjugated flurbiprofen. Unlike other arylpropionic acid derivatives (e.g., ibuprofen), metabolism of R-flurbiprofen to S-flurbiprofen is minimal.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies have demonstrated that cytochrome CYP2C9 plays an important role in the metabolism of flurbiprofen to its major metabolite 4’-hydroxy-flurbiprofen. The 4’-hydroxy-flurbiprofen metabolite showed little anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of inflammation. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies also demonstrated glucuronidation of both enantiomers of flurbiprofen and 4’-hydroxy-flurbiprofen. UGT2B7 is the predominant UGT isozyme responsible for the glucuronidation. Flurbiprofen does not induce enzymes that alter its metabolism.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span><br/>
Following dosing with flurbiprofen, less than 3% of flurbiprofen is excreted unchanged in the urine, with about 70% of the dose eliminated in the urine as flurbiprofen, 4’-hydroxy-flurbiprofen, and their acylglucuronide conjugates. Because renal elimination is a significant pathway of elimination of flurbiprofen metabolites, dosing adjustment in patients with moderate or severe renal dysfunction may be necessary to avoid accumulation of flurbiprofen metabolites.</p><p>The mean terminal elimination half-lives (t<span class="Sub">½</span>) of R- and S-flurbiprofen are similar, about 4.7 and 5.7 hours, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Pediatric:</span> The pharmacokinetics of flurbiprofen have not been investigated in pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Race:</span> No pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been identified.</p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric:</span> Flurbiprofen pharmacokinetics were similar in geriatric arthritis patients, younger arthritis patients, and young healthy volunteers receiving flurbiprofen 100 mg as either single or multiple doses.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span> Hepatic metabolism may account for &gt; 90% of flurbiprofen elimination, so patients with hepatic disease may require reduced doses of flurbiprofen compared to patients with normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetics of R- and S-flurbiprofen were similar, however, in alcoholic cirrhosis patients (N = 8) and young healthy volunteers (N = 8) following administration of a single 200 mg dose of flurbiprofen. Flurbiprofen plasma protein binding may be decreased in patients with liver disease and serum albumin concentrations below 3.1 g/dL.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment:</span> Renal clearance is an important route of elimination for flurbiprofen metabolites, but a minor route of elimination for unchanged flurbiprofen (≤ 3% of total clearance). The unbound clearances of R- and S-flurbiprofen did not differ significantly between normal healthy volunteers (N = 6, 50 mg single dose) and patients with renal impairment (N = 8, inulin clearances ranging from 11 to 43 mL/min, 50 mg multiple doses). Flurbiprofen plasma protein binding may be decreased in patients with renal impairment and serum albumin concentrations below 3.9 g/dL. Elimination of flurbiprofen metabolites may be reduced in patients with renal impairment.</p><p>Flurbiprofen is not significantly removed from the blood into dialysate in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span><br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Antacids:</span></span><br/>
Administration of flurbiprofen to volunteers under fasting conditions or with antacid suspension yielded similar serum flurbiprofen-time profiles in young adult subjects (n = 12). In geriatric subjects (n = 7), there was a reduction in the rate but not the extent of flurbiprofen absorption.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Aspirin:</span></span><br/>
Concurrent administration of flurbiprofen and aspirin resulted in 50% lower serum flurbiprofen concentrations. This effect of aspirin (which is also seen with other NSAIDs) has been demonstrated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 15) and in healthy volunteers (n = 16) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Beta-adrenergic Blocking Agents:</span></span><br/>
The effect of flurbiprofen on blood pressure response to propranolol and atenolol was evaluated in men with mild uncomplicated hypertension (n = 10). Flurbiprofen pretreatment attenuated the hypotensive effect of a single dose of propranolol but not atenolol. Flurbiprofen did not appear to affect the beta-blocker-mediated reduction in heart rate. Flurbiprofen did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Cimetidine, Ranitidine:</span></span><br/>
In normal volunteers (n = 9), pretreatment with cimetidine or ranitidine did not affect flurbiprofen pharmacokinetics, except for a small (13%) but statistically significant increase in the area under the serum concentration curve of flurbiprofen in subjects who received cimetidine.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Digoxin:</span></span><br/>
In studies of healthy males (n = 14), concomitant administration of flurbiprofen and digoxin did not change the steady state serum levels of either drug [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Diuretics:</span></span><br/>
Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that, like other NSAIDs, flurbiprofen can interfere with the effects of furosemide. Although results have varied from study to study, effects have been shown on furosemide-stimulated diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lithium:</span></span><br/>
In a study of 11 women with bipolar disorder receiving lithium carbonate at a dosage of 600 to 1200 mg/day, administration of 100 mg flurbiprofen every 12 hours increased plasma lithium concentrations by 19%. Four of 11 patients experienced a clinically important increase (&gt; 25% or &gt; 0.2 mmol/L) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Methotrexate:</span></span><br/>
In a study of six adult arthritis patients, coadministration of methotrexate (10 to 25 mg/dose) and flurbiprofen (300 mg/day) resulted in no observable interaction between these two drugs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Oral Hypoglycemic Agents:</span></span><br/>
In a clinical study, flurbiprofen was administered to adult diabetics who were already receiving glyburide (n = 4), metformin (n = 2), chlorpropamide with phenformin (n=3), or glyburide with phenformin (n = 6). Although there was a slight reduction in blood sugar concentrations during concomitant administration of flurbiprofen and hypoglycemic agents, there were no signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates:</span></span><br/>
In patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on genotype or previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin and phenytoin), reduce the dose of flurbiprofen to avoid abnormally high plasma levels due to reduced metabolic clearance.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span><br/>
Flurbiprofen was not carcinogenic in long-term studies in Fischer-344 and CD rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day and in CFLP mice at doses up to 12 mg/kg/day (0.16-times and 0.19-times, respectively, the human dose of 300 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span><br/>
