tonometry, gonioscopy, removal of corneal foreign bodies and other short corneal or conjunctival procedures.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Known hypersensitivity to any component of this product.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Prolonged use of a topical ocular anesthetic is not recommended.  It may produce permanent corneal<br/>
opacification with accompanying visual loss.  Avoid contamination - do not touch tip of sterile dropper<br/>
used to dispense solution to any surface.  Replace container closure immediately after using.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">This product should be used cautiously and sparingly in patients with known allergies, cardiac disease, or<br/>
hyperthyroidism.  The long-term toxicity is unknow; prolonged use may possible delay woundhealing.  Although<br/>
exceedingly rare with ophthalmic application of local anesthetics, it should be borne in mind that systemic toxicity<br/>
manifested by central nervous sytem stimulation followed by depression may occur.  Protection of the eye from<br/>
irritation, chemicals, foreign bodies and rubbing during the period of anesthesia is very important.  Tonometers soaked<br/>
in sterilizing or detergent solutions should be thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water prior to use.  Patients should<br/>
be advised to avoid touching the eye until the anesthsia has worn off.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Occasional temporary stinging, burning, and conjunctival redness have been reported after use of ocular anesthetics,<br/>
as well as a rare, severe, immediate-type, apparent hyper-allergic corneal reaction, with acute, intense and diffuse<br/>
epithelial keratitis, a gray, ground glass appearance, sloughing of large areas of necrotic epithelium, corneal filaments<br/>
and someimes, iritis with descemetitis.<br/>
Allergic contact dermatitis with drying and fissuring of the fingertips has been reported.<br/>
