Monoclonal antibodies are made to target only certain cells in the body. Bezlotoxumab works by binding to a specific toxin produced by the Clostridium difficile bacteria, to help neutralize the toxin's effects.</p><p>Bezlotoxumab is used together with antibiotic medicine in adults with Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), an infection that can cause life-threatening diarrhea. Bezlotoxumab may help keep this infection from coming back after treatment.</p><p><b>Bezlotoxumab is not an antibiotic and will not treat the infection itself.</b></p><p>Bezlotoxumab may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Before you receive bezlotoxumab, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions or allergies, and all the medicines you are using.
