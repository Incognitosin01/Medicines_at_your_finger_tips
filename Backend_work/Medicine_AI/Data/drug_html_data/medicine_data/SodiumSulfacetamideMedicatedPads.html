</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads contain 10% sodium sulfacetamide. Inactive ingredients: purified water, sodium thiosulfate, trisodium EDTA, and urea.</p><p>Sodium sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity. Chemically, sodium sulfacetamide is C<span class="Sub">8</span>H<span class="Sub">9</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>Na0<span class="Sub">3</span>S•H<span class="Sub">2</span>0, with a molecular weight of 254.24. Chemically it is Acetamide, N- [(4 aminophenyl) sulfonyl]-, monosodium salt and monohydrate, with the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</span> Sodium sulfacetamide exerts a bacteriostatic effect against sulfonamide-sensitive gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms including Propionibacterium acnes commonly isolated from secondary cutaneous pyogenic infections.</p><p>The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin in humans has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</span> 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads are indicated for the treatment of bacterial infections of the skin due to organisms susceptible to sulfonamides including Propionibacterium acnes. They are also intended for topical control of seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads are contraindicated in persons with known or suspected hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or to any of the ingredients of the preparation. 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads are not to be used by patients with kidney disease.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Sulfonamides are known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome in hypersensitive individuals. Stevens-Johnson syndrome also has been reported following the topical use of sodium sulfacetamide. Cases of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus from topical sulfacetamide have also been reported.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> General: Nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi, may proliferate with the use of this preparation. Hypersensitivity reactions may recur when a sulfonamide is readministered, irrespective of the route of administration, and cross hypersensitivity between different sulfonamides may occur. If 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads produce signs of hypersensitivity or other untoward reactions, discontinue use of the preparation. Systemic absorption of topical sulfonamides is greater following application to large, infected, abraded, denuded, or severely burned areas. Under these circumstances, any of the adverse effects produced by the systemic administration of these agents could potentially occur, and appropriate observations and laboratory determinations should be performed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Information For Patients:</span> Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips, and mucous membranes. If accidental contact occurs, rinse with water. Patients should discontinue the use of 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads if the condition becomes worse, or if a rash develops in the area being treated or elsewhere. 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads also should be discontinued promptly and the physician notified if any arthritis, fever, or sores in the mouth develop.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads are incompatible with silver preparations.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> Long-term animal studies for carcinogenic potential have not been performed on 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C:</span> Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads. It also is not known whether 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk following topical use of 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads are administered to a nursing woman.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Reports of irritation and hypersensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide are uncommon. The following adverse reactions, reported after administration of sterile ophthalmic sodium sulfacetamide, are noteworthy: instances of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and instances of local hypersensitivity, which progressed to a syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosus; in one case a fatal outcome has been reported (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.)</p><p><span class="Bold">Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: <span class="Italics">Cutaneous Bacterial Infection</span> -</span> Gently apply 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads to the affected areas 1 to 2 times daily or as directed by a physician until the infection has cleared.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Seborrheic dermatitis</span> - Gently apply 10% Sodium Sulfacetamide Medicated Pads to the skin or scalp 1 to 2 times daily or as directed by a physician.</p><p>Dispense in accordance with applicable state law.
