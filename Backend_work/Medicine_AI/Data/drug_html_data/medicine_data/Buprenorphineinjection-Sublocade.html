A healthcare provider will give you this injection. You should not give yourself this medicine.</p><p><b>Sublocade should never be injected into a vein or a muscle. This medicine is for injection only under the skin.</b> Sublocade forms a solid mass when it comes into contact with a bodily fluid such as blood. Injecting Sublocade into a vein or muscle could result in damage to the skin or underlying tissues, as well as a blood clot that could travel to the lungs and cause death.</p><p>After each injection, you may see or feel a small lump under your skin where the medicine was injected. This could last for several weeks but the lump should eventually get smaller. Avoid rubbing or massaging the lump, or wearing tight clothing over the area.</p><p>At least 26 days should pass between each injection of Sublocade.</p><p>Sublocade is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include counseling and other types of addiction support. Tell your doctor if you feel that this medicine is not helping to improve your symptoms of addiction.</p><p>You will need frequent blood tests to check your liver function.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using Sublocade.</p><p><b>Any medical care provider who treats you should know that you are being treated for opioid addiction and that you are receiving Sublocade.</b> Make sure your family members know how to provide this information in case they need to speak for you during an emergency.</p><p>Do not stop receiving Sublocade suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your Sublocade injection.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since this medicine is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while receiving Sublocade?</h2><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how this medicine will affect you. Dizziness or drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries.</p><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p><b>Avoid using any opioid pain medicine without approval from the doctor who is treating you with Sublocade.</b> Opioid pain medicine will not work as well while you are receiving Sublocade.
