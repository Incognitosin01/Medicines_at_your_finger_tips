Assess patientâ€™s risk before prescribing and monitor closely for these behaviors and conditions.Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or when used in patients at higher risk.Accidental ingestion of codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of codeine.Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine; most cases followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and many of the children had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism. Codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Avoid the use of codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex. Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death.The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with codeine are complex, requiring careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, codeine, and the active metabolite, morphine. Avoid the use of codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex in patients who are taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor, CYP3A4 inducer, or 2D6 inhibitor.Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Avoid the use of codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol. Codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex is not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If codeine polistirex/chlorpheniramine polistirex is used for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It acts directly on the cough center in the brain to prevent a cough. Chlorpheniramine polistirex is an antihistamine that treats or prevents the symptoms of an allergy.</p><p>When codeine polistirex is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming. This could cause mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to unwanted withdrawal effects if codeine is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely. Talk to your doctor if you have questions.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex or any other medicines.

Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p><i>It should not be used to relieve pain after the surgical removal of tonsils or adenoids in children. Severe breathing problems and deaths have been reported in some children who received codeine after tonsil or adenoid surgery</i>.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of codeine and chlorpheniramine combination have not been performed in the geriatric population, no geriatric-specific problems have been documented to date. However, elderly patients are more likely to develop age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. If your cough does not improve or if it gets worse within 5 days, call your doctor.</p><p>Do not use chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid [MarplanÂ®], linezolid [ZyvoxÂ®], phenelzine [NardilÂ®], selegiline [EldeprylÂ®], tranylcypromine [ParnateÂ®]) within the past 14 days.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, <i>do not use more than your prescribed dose</i>. Call your doctor for instructions.</p><p><i>Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex without first checking with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as abdominal or stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping.</p><p>Codeine is changed to morphine in the body. Some people change codeine to morphine more quickly than others. These individuals are called "ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine". <i>Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing</i>. These symptoms may indicate that you are an "ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine". As a result, there is too much morphine in the body and more side effects of morphine than usual. Children may be especially sensitive to this effect (eg, serious breathing problems, death). Do not give chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex to children 12 to 18 years of age who have had surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids.</p><p>If a nursing mother is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine, it could lead to a morphine overdose in the nursing baby and cause very serious side effects.</p><p><i>For nursing mothers taking chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking codeine or about how chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex may affect your baby.</li>
<li>Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby.</li>
<li>Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep more than 4 hours at a time.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor, hospital emergency room, or local emergency services (eg, "call 9-1-1") immediately if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention.</li>
</ul><p>Using chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex.</p><p>Using chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex may make you confused, dizzy, or drowsy. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how chlorpheniramine and codeine polistirex affects you</i>.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem.
