The actions are similar to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH, Gonadotropin releasing hormone, GnRH) in humans. LHRH is the key mediator in the liberation of the pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). LHRH may modify reproductive ability by influencing plasma gonadotropin levels and concomitantly gonadal steroid levels.<br/>
