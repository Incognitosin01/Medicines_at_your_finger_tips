</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ganciclovir</h2><h3>Treatment of CMV Retinitis</h3><p class="First">Ganciclovir for injection is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in immunocompromised adult patients, including patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Prevention of CMV Disease in Transplant Recipients</h3><p class="First">Ganciclovir for injection is indicated for the prevention of CMV disease in adult transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><h2>Ganciclovir Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosing and Administration Information</h3><ul>
<li>To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, Ganciclovir for injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution.</li>
<li>Do not administer Ganciclovir for injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels.</li>
<li>The recommended dosage and infusion rate for Ganciclovir for injection should not be exceeded.</li>
<li>Do not administer the reconstituted Ganciclovir for injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH <span class="Italics">[see Description 11]</span> .</li>
<li>Administration of Ganciclovir for injection should be accompanied by adequate hydration.</li>
<li>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</li>
</ul><h3>Testing Before and During Treatment</h3><ul>
<li>Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir for injection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].</span></li>
<li>Complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients in whom Ganciclovir for injection or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in cytopenias, or in whom absolute neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/μL at the beginning of treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</li>
<li>All patients should be monitored for renal function before and during treatment with Ganciclovir for injection and dose should be adjusted as needed <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></li>
<li>Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmological examinations during treatment with Ganciclovir for injection solution to monitor disease status and for other retinal abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>Recommended Dosage for Treatment of CMV Retinitis in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Induction Dosage:</span> The recommended initial dosage of Ganciclovir for injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Maintenance Dosage:</span> Following induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dosage of Ganciclovir for injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage for the Prevention of CMV Disease in Adult Transplant Recipients with Normal Renal Function</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Induction Dosage:</span> The recommended initial dosage of Ganciclovir for injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Maintenance Dosage:</span> Following induction, the recommended maintenance dosage of Ganciclovir for injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation.</p><h3>Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">For patients with impairment of renal function, refer to Table 1 for recommended doses of Ganciclovir for injection for induction and maintenance dosage for treatment of CMV retinitis and prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Carefully monitor serum creatinine or creatinine clearance before and during treatment to allow for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function.</p><p>Creatinine clearance for females = 0.85 × male value</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis</span></p><p>Induction dosing for Ganciclovir for injection in patients undergoing hemodialysis should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg 3 times per week; and maintenance dosing should not exceed 0.625 mg/kg 3 times per week following each hemodialysis session. Ganciclovir for injection should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h3>Preparation of Ganciclovir for Injection</h3><p class="First">Ganciclovir for injection must be reconstituted and diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 15 mL clear glass vial contains Ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of Ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner:</p><h3>Handling and Disposal</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of solutions of Ganciclovir for injection. Solutions of Ganciclovir for injection are alkaline (pH 11). Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with Ganciclovir for injection solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended.</p><p>Because Ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs <span class="Sup">1</span> <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For injection: Single dose vial containing 500 mg of Ganciclovir as a sterile lyophilized white to off-white powder for reconstitution with 10 mL of preservative-free Sterile Water for Injection, USP for intravenous use <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Ganciclovir for injection is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to Ganciclovir, valGanciclovir, or any component of the formulation.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have been observed in patients treated with Ganciclovir for injection. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> . Ganciclovir for injection is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/µL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/µL. Ganciclovir for injection should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving Ganciclovir for injection solution for treatment of CMV retinitis.</p><p>Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving Ganciclovir for injection <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> , complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom Ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/µL at the beginning of treatment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ganciclovir for injection should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of Ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]</span> .</p><p>Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir for injection is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span> .</p><h3>Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Based on animal data and limited human data, Ganciclovir for injection at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of Ganciclovir for injection <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></span></p><h3>Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Ganciclovir for injection may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of Ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir for injection. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir for injection <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis</h3><p class="First">Animal data indicate that Ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir for injection should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span> .</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in at least 20% of patients were pyrexia, diarrhea, leukopenia, nausea, anemia, asthenia, headache, cough, decreased appetite, dyspnea, abdominal pain, sepsis, hyperhidrosis, and blood creatinine increased.</p><p>Selected adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials of Ganciclovir for injection are summarized below, according to the participating study patient population.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Patients with CMV Retinitis:</span> Three controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials comparing Ganciclovir for injection and Ganciclovir capsules for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis have been completed. During these trials, Ganciclovir for injection or Ganciclovir capsules were prematurely discontinued in 9% of subjects because of adverse reactions. Selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported during the conduct of these controlled trials are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span> .</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Retinal Detachment:</span> Retinal detachment has been observed in subjects with CMV retinitis both before and after initiation of therapy with Ganciclovir. Its relationship to therapy with Ganciclovir is unknown. Retinal detachment occurred in 11% of patients treated with Ganciclovir for injection and in 8% of patients treated with Ganciclovir capsules.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Transplant Recipients:</span> There have been three controlled clinical trials of Ganciclovir for injection for the prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Selected laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Table 4 and Table 5 below.

Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of Ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of Ganciclovir for injection and drugs excreted by the same pathway as Ganciclovir. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of Ganciclovir and the coadministered drug.</p><p>Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with Ganciclovir are listed in Table 6 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>In animal studies, Ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span> . Although placental transfer of Ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether Ganciclovir for injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk</span></p><p>Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50–90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Daily intravenous doses of Ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of Ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span> .</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>No data are available regarding the presence of Ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.

Patients were followed-up for six months after valGanciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valGanciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline; whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valGanciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valGanciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group).</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir for injection have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><p>A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Ganciclovir after administration of Ganciclovir for injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after Ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C <span class="Sub">max</span> 5.5 ± 1.6 and 7.0 ± 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 ± 1.75 and 3.56 ± 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t <span class="Sub">1/2</span> of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively.</p><p>In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg).

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir for injection is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, Ganciclovir for injection should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span> .</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dose reduction is recommended when administering Ganciclovir for injection to patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> .</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir for injection have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Reports of adverse reactions after overdoses with Ganciclovir for injection, some with fatal outcomes, have been received from clinical trials and during postmarketing experience.

Ganciclovir is a synthetic guanine derivative active against cytomegalovirus (CMV).</p><p>Chemically, Ganciclovir is 9-[[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)-ethoxy]methyl]guanine and Ganciclovir sodium is 9-[[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)-ethoxy]methyl]guanine, monosodium salt. The chemical structures of Ganciclovir sodium and Ganciclovir are:</p><p>Ganciclovir is a white to off-white crystalline powder. Ganciclovir is a polar hydrophilic compound with a solubility of 2.6 mg/mL in water at 25°C and an n-octanol/water partition coefficient of 0.022. The pK <span class="Sub">a</span>s for Ganciclovir are 2.2 and 9.4.</p><p>Ganciclovir for injection, formulated as monosodium salt, using sodium hydroxide as a salt forming agent, is a sterile white to off-white lyophilized powder. The lyophilized powder has an aqueous solubility of greater than 50 mg/mL at 25°C. At physiological pH, Ganciclovir sodium exists as the un-ionized form with a solubility of approximately 6 mg/mL at 37°C.</p><p>Each vial contains Ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg Ganciclovir.</p><p>Inactive ingredients may include hydrochloric acid (QS) and sodium hydroxide (QS) added to adjust the pH.</p><p>All doses in this package insert are specified in terms of Ganciclovir.</p><h2>Ganciclovir - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span> .</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg Ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 ± 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 ± 6.1 mcg∙hr/mL (n=16) and C <span class="Sub">max</span> ranged between 8.27 ± 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 ± 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The steady-state volume of distribution of Ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 ± 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg Ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over Ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>When administered intravenously, Ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of Ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 ± 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered Ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered Ganciclovir was 3.52 ± 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 ± 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 ± 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 ± 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir for injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of Ganciclovir ( Table 7).</p><p>Plasma concentrations of Ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session <span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">.</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir for injection in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As Ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in Ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of Ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>Table 8 and Table 9 provide a listing of established drug interaction studies with Ganciclovir. Table 8 provides the effects of coadministered drug on Ganciclovir plasma pharmacokinetic parameters, whereas Table 9 provides the effects of Ganciclovir on plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of coadministered drug.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo. In CMV-infected cells, Ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to Ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce Ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of Ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of Ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by Ganciclovir triphosphate.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity</span></p><p>The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC <span class="Sub">50</span>), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of Ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC <span class="Sub">50</span> value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 µM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC <span class="Sub">50</span> value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 µM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC <span class="Sub">50</span> value = 0.1 to 2.7 µM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Viral Resistance</span> Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to Ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of Ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54.</p><p>In vivo: Viruses resistant to Ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with Ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to Ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported Ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10.</p><p>CMV resistance to Ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received Ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir for injection. In a controlled study of oral Ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of Ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to Ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis.</p><p>The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cross-Resistance</span></p><p>Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by Ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to Ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to Ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Ganciclovir was carcinogenic in mice at the same mean drug exposure in humans as at the RHD (5 mg/kg). At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered Ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, Ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, Ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans.</p><p>Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 µg/mL, respectively. In the mouse micronucleus assay, Ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 µg/mL.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Treatment of CMV Retinitis</h3><p class="First">In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with Ganciclovir for injection solution resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of Ganciclovir for injection 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week.</p><p>In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with Ganciclovir for injection was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group.</p><p>Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing Ganciclovir for injection to oral Ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 and Figures 1, 2, and 3, and are discussed below.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Trial ICM 1653:</span> In this randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between March 1991 and November 1992, patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed CMV retinitis received a 3-week induction course of Ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for 1 additional week. Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either Ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or Ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy.
