</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> PNV - Iron Polysaccharides/Folic Acid/DHA (29 mg-1 mg-200 mg) is a prescription prenatal/postnatal multivitamin/ multimineral nutritional supplement with Omega-3 fatty acid. PNV - Iron Polysaccharides/Folic Acid/DHA (29 mg-1 mg-200 mg) is an oblong shaped, dark blue colored softgel, imprinted with 230.</p><h2>Inactive Ingredients</h2><p class="First">Gelatin (Bovine), Yellow Bees Wax, Glycerin, Soybean Oil, Soy Lecithin, Purified Water, Natural Creamy Orange Flavour, FD&amp;C Blue #1, Sodium Citrate, Titanium Dioxide, Ethyl Vanillin, FD&amp;C Yellow #6 and other ancillary excipients as needed to ensure product stability.</p><p><span class="Italics">Since additives, preservatives, bioavailability enhances, colors and flavors of natural origin are preferred over synthetics, it may be the case that product color, appearance and/or taste may vary slightly over time; and it may be necessary to substitute excipients during the manufacturing process as needed to preserve product appearance and continuity in order to avoid confusion in the market place and ensure the highest therapeutic target, safety and quality.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Warning: This product contains FD&amp;C Blue #1 and FD&amp;C Yellow #6.</span> It also contains Soy, Fish and Bovine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><br/>
FOLATE is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. It is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoiesis. It also promotes white blood cell (WBC) and platelet production in folate-deficiency anemia. Folate is associated with methylation and transformylation biochemistry.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FOLATE REGULATION</span><br/>
The Federal Register Notices from 1971 to 1973 established that increased folate was proper therapy in megaloblastic anemias of tropical and nontropical sprue, nutritional origin, pregnancy, infancy and childhood<span class="Sup">4,5,6</span>. Folate metabolism can be affected by malabsorption issues which differ widely among population groups. The March 5, 1996 Federal Register Notice (61 FR 8760) states that “The agency concluded that the scientific literature did not support the superiority of any one source of folate over others, and that the data were insufficient to provide a basis for stating that a specific <span class="Bold Italics">amount of folate is more effective than another</span> amount [emphasis added]<span class="Sup">9,10</span> The actual amount and source of folate require a licensed medical practitioner’s supervision to achieve a satisfactory maintenance level, and may exceed the 0.8 mg UL. The Federal Register Notice of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20750) specifically states that “dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription (21 CFR 121.1134). <span class="Bold Italics">Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription. Oral preparations supplying more than 0.8 mg of folate per dosage unit would be restricted to prescription dispensing</span> and that a dietary supplement furnishing 0.8 mg could be prescribed when a maintenance level of 0.8 mg per day was indicated. When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture and/or CSF folate levels have become normal, a maintenance level should be used. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent. In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased [emphasis added]<span class="Sup">7</span>". However, once the level of active folate exceeds 0.8 mg as prescribed dosages, then the product is no longer a medical food but a <span class="Bold Italics">dietary management / prescription (Rx) folate</span> regardless of pregnancy/lactation status in spite of the fact that folic acid including reduced forms, may be added to medical foods as defined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 USC 360ee(b)(3)), or to food (21 CFR 172.345)<span class="Sup">11</span>. In the Letter Regarding Dietary Supplement Health Claim for Folic Acid, Vitamin B<span class="Sub">6</span>, and Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> and Vascular Disease (Docket No. 99P3029) dated November 28, 2000, FDA wrote “... high intakes of folate may partially and temporarily correct pernicious anemia while the neurological damage of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency progresses. IOM/NAS (1998) set the UL for all adults of 1 mg per day because of devastating and irreversible neurological consequences of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, the data suggesting that <span class="Bold Italics">pernicious anemia may develop at a younger age in some racial or ethnic groups, and the uncertainty about the extent of the occurrence of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency in younger age groups</span> (IOM/NAS, 1998) [emphasis added]<span class="Sup">8</span>.” Summary: This product is a dietary management product that due to advanced folate levels, requires administration under the care of a licensed medical practitioner, and the most appropriate way to do that is to provide the product as prescription for pedigree reporting and safety monitoring. The ingredients, indication or claims of this product are not to be construed to be drug claims.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for PNV Iron Polysaccharides, Folic Acid, DHA</h2><p class="First">PNV - Iron Polysaccharides/Folic Acid/DHA (29 mg-1 mg-200 mg) is a prescription multivitamin/ multimineral nutritional supplement with Omega-3 fatty acid indicated for use in improving the nutritional status of women throughout pregnancy and in the postnatal period for both lactating and non-lactating mothers. PNV - Iron Polysaccharides/Folic Acid/DHA (29 mg-1 mg-200 mg) is also beneficial in improving the nutritional status of women prior to conception.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pedigree statement: This product is a prescription-folate with or without other dietary ingredients that - due to increased folate levels (AUG 2 1973 FR 20750), requires an Rx on the label because of increased risk associated with masking of B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia). As such, this product requires licensed medical supervision, an Rx status, and a National Drug Code (NDC) as required by pedigree reporting requirements and insurance-reimbursement applications.</span></p><p class="First">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. <span class="Bold">Keep this product out of reach of children.</span> In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INTERACTIONS:</span> Talk to your healthcare practitioner and/or pharmacist before taking or using any prescription or over-the-counter medicines or herbal/health supplements alongside this product.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components contained in this product. This product is contraindicated for individuals with conditions for which any of the ingredients are contraindicated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Caution is recommended in patients with a history of bipolar illness. Mood elevation is possible in this population. Caution is also recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as folate may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold. Furthermore, it has been reported that anticonvulsant medications interfere with folate metabolism, but the exact action is unclear; therefore caution is recommended with patients in this therapeutic group.</p><p>Folinic acid may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly formyl-THF and fluorouracil. Concomitant granulocytopenia and fever were present in some but not all of the patients. The concomitant use of formyl-THF with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of <span class="Italics">Pneumocystis carinii</span> pneumonia in patients with HIV infection was associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study.<span class="Sup">35</span> Patients undergoing cancer treatment should consult their licensed medical practitioner for advice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Folate alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><p>Daily ingestion of more than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids (ALA, EPA, and DHA) may have potential antithrombotic activities, or effects, and may increase bleeding times. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis, including those taking anticoagulants. Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS:</span> Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral folate. Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema and the feeling of swelling of the entire body has been associated with cobalamin. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, transient skin rash, flushing, epigastric pain, and constipation have been associated with acetylcysteine.</p><p>Call your medical practitioner about side effects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PHARMACOLOGY: FOLATE</span> - Folates are best known for reducing the incidence of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs). NTDs are congenital malformations produced by failure of the neural tube to form and close properly during embryonic development.<span class="Sup">3</span> During the first four weeks of pregnancy - when many women do not even realize that they have conceived, adequate maternal folate intake is essential to reduce the risk of NTDs. As the postnatal period approaches there is increased demand again for folate regardless of lactation status. Folate is involved in transformylation and methylation metabolism as well as - indirectly, succinylation metabolism (through the “methyl trap” hypothesis). Folate plays a central role in the formation of nucleic acid precursors, such as thymidylic acid and purine nucleotides, which are essential for nucleic acid synthesis and cell division. IOM/NAS (1998) noted that the evidence for a protective effect from folate supplements is much stronger than that for food folate<span class="Sup">10</span>. Other dietary ingredients are added to folate as cofactors, coenzymes and co-metabolites; in studies by Czeizel and Dudas (1992) and Berry et al. (1999), factors other than folate intakes may affect the magnitude of risk reduction or participate in a co-protective effect with folate<span class="Sup">10</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.</span></p><p>This product may - under certain circumstances, be dispensed through a certified mail-order program so long as there is record of prescription AND confirmation that the patient is under licensed medical supervision. This product is not an Orange Book (OB) rated product, therefore all prescriptions using this product shall be pursuant to state statutes as applicable.</p><p>++This product is a prescription-folate with or without other dietary ingredients that - due to increased folate levels (AUG 2 1973 FR 20750), requires an Rx on the label because of increased risk associated with masking of B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency (pernicious anemia). Based on our assessment of the risk of obscuring pernicious anemia, this product requires licensed medical supervision, an Rx status, and a National Drug Code (NDC) - or similar product code, as required by pedigree reporting requirements and supply-chain control as well as - in some cases, for insurance-reimbursement applications.</p><h2>REFERENCES:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">This product has been manufactured in a facility that also manufactures products containing tree nuts, peanuts, fish, egg, wheat, milk, soy and shellfish.
