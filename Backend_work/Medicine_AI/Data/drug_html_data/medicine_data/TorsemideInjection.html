</ul><h2>Torsemide Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Torsemide Injection is a diuretic of the pyridine-sulfonylurea class. Its chemical name is 1-isopropyl-3-<br/>
[(4-rn-toluidino-3-pyridyl) sulfonyl]urea and its structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Its molecular formula is C,sH;!ON4 0 3S, its pKa is 6.42, and its molecular weight is 348.42.</p><p>Torsemide is a white to off-white c rys ta lline powder. Torsemide vials for intravenous injection contain a<br/>
sterile solution of torsemide (10 mglmL), polyethylene g lycal-400, tromethamine, and sodium hydroxide<br/>
(as needed to adjust p H ) in water for injection.</p><h2>Torsemide Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Mechanism of Action<br/>
Micropuncture studies in anima ls have shown that torsemide acts from within the lumen of the thick<br/>
ascending portion of the loop of Henle, where it inhibits the Na'JK'/2CI'-carrier system. Clinical<br/>
pharmacology studies have confirmed this site of action in humans, and effects in other segments of<br/>
the nephron have not been demonstrated. Diuretic activity thus correlates better with the rate of drug<br/>
excretion in the urine than with the concentration in the blood.<br/>
Torsemide increases the urinary excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not significantly<br/>
alterglomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or acid-base balance.<br/>
<br/>
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism<br/>
The volume of distribution of torsemide is 12 liters to 15 liters in normal adults or in patients with mild<br/>
to moderate renal failure or congestive heart failure. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis, the volume of<br/>
distribution is approximately doubled.<br/>
In normal subjects the elimination half- life of torsemide is approximately 3.5 hours. Torsemide is cleared<br/>
from the circulation by both hepatic metabolism (approximately 80% of total clearance) and excretion<br/>
into the urine (approximately 20% of total clearance in patients w ith normal renal function). The major<br/>
metabolite in humans is the carboxylic acid derivative, which is biologically inactive. Two of the lesser<br/>
metabolites possess some diuretic activity, but for practical purposes metabolism terminates the action<br/>
of the drug.<br/>
Because torsemide is extensively bound to plasma protein (&gt; 990/0), very little enters tubular urine via<br/>
glomerular filtration. Most renal clearance of torsemide occurs via active secretion of the drug by the<br/>
proximal tubules into tubular urine.<br/>
In patients with decompensated congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal clearance are both reduced,<br/>
probably because of hepatic congestion and decreased renal plasma flow, respectively. The total<br/>
clearance of torsemide is approximately 50% of that seen in healthy volunteers, and the plasma half-life<br/>
and AUG a re correspondingly increased. Because of reduced renal clearance, a smaller fraction of any<br/>
given dose is delivered to the intraluminal site of action, so at any given dose there is less natriuresis in<br/>
patients with congestive heart failure than in normal subjects.<br/>
In patients with renal failure, renal clearance of torsemide is markedly decreased but total plasma<br/>
clearance is not significantly altered. A smaller fraction of the administered dose is delivered to the<br/>
intraluminal site of action, and the natriuretic action of any given dose of diuretic is reduced. A diuretic<br/>
response in renal failure may still be achieved if patients are given higher doses. The total plasma<br/>
clearance and elimination half-life of torsemide remain normal under the conditions of impaired renal<br/>
function because metabolic elimination by the liver remains intact.<br/>
In patients with hepatic cirrhosis, the volume of distribution, plasma half-life, and renal clearance are all<br/>
increased, but total clearance is unchanged.<br/>
The pharmacokinetic profile of torsemide in healthy elderly subjects is similar to that in young subjects<br/>
except for a decrease in renal clearance related to the decline in renal function that commonly occurs<br/>
with aging. However, total plasma clearance and elimination half-life remain unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
Clinical Effects<br/>
The diuretic effect s of torsemide begin within 10 minutes of intravenous dosing and peak within the first<br/>
hour. With intravenous administration diuresis lasts about 6 to 8 h ours. In healthy subjects given single<br/>
doses, the dose-response relationship for sodium excretion is linear over the dose range o f 2.5 mg to 20<br/>
mg. The increase in potassium excretion is negligible after a single dose of up to 10 mg and only slight<br/>
(5 mEq to 15 mEq) after a single dose o f 20 mg.<br/>
<br/>
Congestive Heart Failure<br/>
Torsemide has been studied in controlled trials in patients with New York Heart Association Class II to<br/>
Class IV congestive heart failure . Patients who received 10 mg to 20 mg o f daily torsemide in these<br/>
studies achieved significantly greater reductions in weight and edema than did patients who received<br/>
placebo.<br/>
<br/>
Nonanuric Renal Failure<br/>
In single-dose studies in patients with nonanuric renal failure, high doses of torsemide (20 mg to 200<br/>
mg) caused marked increases in water and sodium excretion . In patients with nonanuric renal failure,<br/>
severe enough to require hemodialys is, chronic treatment with up to 200 mg of daily torsemide has<br/>
not been shown to change steady-state fluid retention . When patients in a study of acute renal failure<br/>
received total daily doses of 520 mg to 1200 m g o f to rsemide, 1 9% experienced seizures. Ninety-six<br/>
patients were treated in this study; 6/32 treated with torsemide experienced seizures, 6/32 treated<br/>
with comparably high doses of furosemide experienced seizures, and 1/32 treated with placebo<br/>
experienced a seizure.<br/>
<br/>
Hepatic Cirrhosis<br/>
When given with aldosterone antagonists, torsemide also caused increases in sodium and fluid<br/>
excretion in patients with edema or ascites due to hepatic cirrhosis. Urinary sodium excretion rate<br/>
relative to the urinary excretion rate of torsemide is less in cirrhotic patients than in healthy subjects<br/>
(possibly because of the hyperaldosteronism and resultant sodium retention that are characteristic of<br/>
portal hypertension and ascites). However, because of the increased renal clearance of torsemide in<br/>
patients with hepatic cirrhosis, these factors tend to balance each other, and the result is an overall<br/>
natriuretic response that is similar to that seen in healthy subjects. Chronic use of any diuretic in hepatic<br/>
disease has not been studied in adequate and well-controlled trials.<br/>
<br/>
Essential Hypertension<br/>
In patients with essential hypertenSion, torsemide has been shown in controlled studies to lower blood<br/>
pressure when administered once a day at doses of 5 mg to 10 mg. The antihypertensive effect is near<br/>
maximal after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, but it may continue to increase for up to 12 weeks. Systolic and<br/>
diastolicsupine and standing blood pressures are all reduced. There is no significant orthostatic effect,<br/>
and there is only a minimal peak-trough difference in blood pressure reduction .<br/>
The antihypertensive effects of torsemide are, like those of other diuretics, on the average greater in<br/>
black patients (a low-renin population) than in non black patients.<br/>
When torsemide is first administered, daily urinary sodium excretion increases for a t least a week. With<br/>
chronic administration, however, daily sodium loss comes into balance with dietary sodium intake. If<br/>
the administration of torsemide is suddenly stopped, blood pressure returns to pretreatment levels over<br/>
several days, without over shoot.<br/>
Torsemide has been administered together with j3-adrenergic blocking agents, ACE inhibitors, and<br/>
calcium-channel blockers. Adverse drug inte rac tio n s have n o t been observed, and special dosage<br/>
adjustment has not been necessary.</p><p class="First">Torsemide Injection is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure,<br/>
renal disease, or hepatic disease. Use of torsemide has been found to be effective for the treatment of<br/>
edema associated w th chronic renal failure. Chronic use of any diuretic in hepatic disease has not been<br/>
studied in adequate and well-controlled trials.<br/>
Torsemide Injection is indicated when a rapid onset of diuresis is desired or when oral administration<br/>
is impractical.<br/>
Torsemide Injection is indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other<br/>
antihypertensive agents.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Torsemide Injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to torsemide or to<br/>
sulfonylureas.<br/>
Torsemide Injection is contraindicated in patients who are anuric.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Hepatic Disease With Cirrhosis and Ascites<br/>
Torsemide should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease with cirrhosis and ascites, since<br/>
sudden alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. In these patients,<br/>
diuresis with torsemide (or any other diuretic) is best initiated in the hospital. To prevent hypokalemia<br/>
and metabolic alkalosis, analdosteroneantagonist or potassium-sparing drug should be used<br/>
concomitantly with torsemide.<br/>
<br/>
Ototoxicity<br/>
Tinnitus and hearing loss (usually reversible) have been observed after rapid intravenous injection of<br/>
other loop diuretics and have also been observed after oral Torsemide. It is not certain that these events<br/>
were attributable to torsemide . Ototoxicity has also been seen in animal studies when very high plasma<br/>
levels of torsemide were induced. Administered intravenously, torsemide should be injected slowly over<br/>
2 minutes, and single doses should not exceed 200 mg.<br/>
<br/>
Volume and Electrolyte Depletion<br/>
Patients receiving diuretics should be observed for clinical evidence of electrolyteim balance,<br/>
hypovolemia, orprerenal azotemia . Symptoms of these disturbances may include one or more of the<br/>
following: dryness of the mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains<br/>
or cramps, muscular fatigue , hypotension , oliguria, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Excessive<br/>
diuresis may cause dehydration, blood-volume reduction , and possibly thrombosis and embolism,<br/>
especially in elderly patients. In patients who develop fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hypovolemia,<br/>
orprerenal azotemia, the observed laboratory changes may include hyper-orhypon atremia, hyper -or<br/>
hypochloremia, hyper- or hypokalemia, acid-base abnormalities, and increased blood urea nitrogen<br/>
(BUN). If any of these occur, to rsemide should be discontinued until the situation is corrected; torsemide<br/>
may be restarted at a lower dose.<br/>
In controlled studies in the United States, torsemide was administered to hypertensive patients at doses<br/>
o f 5 mg or 10 mg daily. Afte r 6 weeks at these doses, the mean decrease in serum potassium was<br/>
approximately 0.1 mEq/L. The percentage of patients who had a serum potassium level below 3.5 m Eq/L<br/>
at any time during the studies was essentially the same in patients who received torsemide ( 1.5%) as in<br/>
those who received placebo (3%) . In patients followed for 1 year, there was no further change in mean<br/>
serum potassium levels. In patients with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, orrena l disease<br/>
treated with torsemide at doses higher than those studied in United States a ntihypertensive trials,<br/>
hypokalemia was observed with greater frequency, in a dose-related manner.<br/>
In patients with cardiovascular disease, especially those receiving digitalis glycosides, diuretic-induced<br/>
hypokelemia may be a risk factor for the development of arrhythmias. The risk of hypokalemia is<br/>
greatest in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing a brisk diuresis, inpatients who<br/>
are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with<br/>
corticosteroids or ACTH.<br/>
Periodic monitoring of serum potassium and other electrolytes is advised in patients treated with<br/>
torsemide.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Laboratory Values<br/>
Potassium<br/>
See WARNINGS.<br/>
<br/>
Calcium<br/>
Single doses of torsemide increased the urinary excretion of calcium by normal subjects, but serum<br/>
calcium levels were slightly increased in 4 to 6 week hypertension trials . In a long-term study of patients<br/>
with congestive heart failure, the average 1 year change in serum calcium was a decrease of 0 .1 mgJdL<br/>
(0.02 mmoIlL). Among 426 patients treated with torsemide for an average o f 11 months, hypocalcemia<br/>
was not reported as an adverse event.<br/>
<br/>
Magnesium<br/>
Single doses of torsemide caused healthy volunteers to increase the ir urinary excretion of magnesium,<br/>
but serum magnesium levels were slightly increased in 4 to 6 week hypertension trials. In long-term<br/>
hypertension studies, the average 1 year change in serum magnesium was an increase of 0.03 mgJdL<br/>
(0.01 mmoIlL). Among 426 patients treated with torsemide for an average of 11 months, one case of<br/>
hypomagnesemia (1 .3 m gJdL [0.53 mmollLJ) was reported as an adverse event .<br/>
In a tong- term clinical study of torsemide in patients with congestive heart failure, the estimated<br/>
annual change in serum magnesium was an increase of 0.2 mg/dL (0.08 mmoI/L), but these data are<br/>
confounded by the fact that many of these patients received magnesium supplements. In a 4 week<br/>
study in which magnesium supplementation was not given, the rate of occurrence of serum magnesium<br/>
levels below 1.7 mg/dL (0.7 mmollL) was 60/0 a nd 9% in the groups receiving 5 mg a nd 10 mg of<br/>
torsemide, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), C reatinin e a nd Uric Acid<br/>
Torsemide produces small dose-related increases in each of these laboratory values. In hypertensive<br/>
patients who received 10 mg o f torsemide daily for 6 weeks, the mean increase in blood urea nitrogen<br/>
was 1 .8 mg/dL (0.6 mmo IJL) , the mean increase in serum creatinine was 0.05 mg/dL (4 mmo t/ L) , and<br/>
the mean increase in serum uric acid was 1 .2 m gJdL (70 mmoIJL). Little further change occurred with<br/>
long-term treatment, and all changes reversed when treatment was discontinued.<br/>
Symptomatic gout has been reported in patients receiving torsemide, but its incidence has been similar<br/>
to that seen in patients receiving placebo.<br/>
<br/>
Glucose<br/>
Hypertensive patients who received 10 m g of daily torsemide experienced a mean increase in serum<br/>
glucose concentration o f 5.5 mg/dL (0.3 mmot/L) after 6 weeks of therapy, with a further increase of<br/>
1 .8 mgldL (0.1 mmollL) during the subsequent year. In long-term studies in diabetics, mean fasting<br/>
glucose values were not significantly changed from baseline. Cases of hyperglycemia have been<br/>
reported but are uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
Serum Lipids<br/>
In the controlled short-term hypertension studies in the United States, daily doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and<br/>
20 mg of torsemide were associated with increases in total plasma cholesterol of 4, 4 , and 8 mg/dL (0.1<br/>
to 0.2 mmoIlL ), respectively. The changes subsided during chronic therapy.<br/>
In the same short- term hypertension studies, daily doses of 5 mg, 10 m g and 20 mg of torsemide were<br/>
associated with mean increases in plasma triglycerides of 16, 13, and 71 mg/dL (0. 15 to 0.8 mmoIlL) ,<br/>
respectively.<br/>
In long-term studies of 5 mg to 20 mg of torsemide daily, no clinically significant differences from<br/>
baseline lipid values were observed after 1 year of therapy.<br/>
<br/>
Other<br/>
In long-term studies in hypertensive patients, torsemide has been associated with small mean<br/>
decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit , and erythrocyte count and small mean increases in white blood<br/>
cell count, platelet count, and serum alkaline phosphatase. Although statistically significant, all of these<br/>
changes were medically inconsequential. No significant trends have been observed in any liver enzyme<br/>
tests other than alkaline phosphatase.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">In patients with essential hypertension, torsemide has been administered together with beta-blockers,<br/>
ACE inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers, In patients with congestive heart failure, torsemide has<br/>
been administered together with digitalis glycosides, ACE inhibitors, and o rganic nitrates. None of these<br/>
combined uses was associated with new or unexpected adverse events.<br/>
Torsemide does not affect the protein binding of glyburide or of wartarin, the anticoagulant effect of<br/>
phenprocoumon (a related coumarin derivative), or the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or carvedilol (a<br/>
vasodilator/beta-blocker). In hea lthy subjects, coadministration of torsemide was associated with<br/>
significant reduction in the renal clearance of spironolactone, with corresponding increases in the AUC.<br/>
However, clinical experience indicates that dosage adjustment of either agent is not required ,<br/>
Because torsemide and salicylates compete fo r secretion by rena l tubules, patients receiving high<br/>
doses of salicylates may experience salicylate toxicity when torsemide is concomitantly administe red ,<br/>
Also, although possible inte ractions between torsemide and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents<br/>
(including aspirin) have not been studied, coadministration of these agents with another loop diuretic<br/>
(furosemide) has occasionally been associated with renal dysfunction,<br/>
The natriuretic effect of torsemide (like that of many other diuretics) is partially inhibited by the<br/>
concomitant administration of indomethacin. This effect has been demonstrated for torsemide under<br/>
conditions of dietary sodium restriction (50 mEq/day) but not in the presence of normal sodium intake<br/>
(150 mEq/day).<br/>
The pharmacokinetic profile and diuretic activity of torsemide are not altered by cimetidine or<br/>
s pironolactone, Coadministration of digoxin is reported to increase the area under the curve for<br/>
torsemide by 50%, but dose adjustment of torsemide is not necessary.<br/>
Concomitant use of torsemide and cholestyramine has not been studied in humans but, in a study<br/>
in animals, coadministration of cholestyramine decreased the absorption of orally administered<br/>
torsemide. If torsemide and c holestyramine are used concomitantfy, simultaneous administration is<br/>
not recommended.<br/>
Coadministration of probenecid reduces secretion of torsemide into the proximal tubule and thereby<br/>
decreases the diuretic activity of torsemide.<br/>
Other diuretics are known to reduce the renal clearance of lithium, inducing a high risk of lithium<br/>
toxicity, so coadministration of lithium and diuretics should be undertaken with great caution, if at all.<br/>
Coadministration of lithium and torsemide has not been studied.<br/>
Other diuretics have been reported to increase the ototoxic potential of aminoglycoside antibiotics and<br/>
of ethacrynic acid, especially in the presence of impaired renal function. These potential interactions<br/>
with torsemide have not been studied.<br/>
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility<br/>
No overall increase in tumor incidence was found when torsemide was given to rats and mice<br/>
throughout their lives at doses up to 9 mg/kg/day (rats) and 32 mg/kg/day (mice). On a body-weight<br/>
basis, these doses are 27 to 96 times a human dose of 20 mg; on a body-surface-area basis, they are<br/>
5 to 8 times this dose. In the rat study, the high-dose female group demonstrated renal tubular injury,<br/>
interstitial inflammation, and a statistically significant increase in renal adenomas and carcinomas. The<br/>
tumor incidence in this group was, however, not much higher than the incidence sometimes seen in<br/>
historical controls. Similar signs of chronic non· neoplastic renal injury have been reported in high·dose<br/>
animal studies of other diuretics such as furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide.<br/>
No mutagenic activity was detected in any of a variety of in vivo and in vitro tests of torsemide and<br/>
its major human metabolite. The tests included the Ames test in bacteria (with and without metabolic<br/>
activation), tests for chromosome aberrations and sister-chromatid exchanges in human lymphocytes,<br/>
tests for various nuclear anomalies in cells found in hamster and murine bone marrow, tests for<br/>
unscheduled DNA synthesis in mice and rats, and others.<br/>
In doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (75 times a human dose of 20 mg on a body-weight basis; 13 times this<br/>
dose on a body·surface·area basis), torsemide had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance<br/>
of male or female rats.<br/>
Pregnancy<br/>
Teratogenic Effects<br/>
Pregnancy Category B.<br/>
There was no fetotoxicity or teratogenicity in rats treated with up to 5 mg/kg/day of torsemide (on a<br/>
mg/kg basis, this is 15 times a human dose of 20 mg/day; on a mg/m2 basis, the animal dose is 10<br/>
times the human dose), or in rabbits, treated with 1.6 mg/kg/day (on a mg/kg basis, 5 times the human<br/>
dose of 20 mg/kg/day; on a mg/m2 basis, 1.7 times this dose). Fetal and maternal toxicity (decrease in<br/>
average body weight, increase in fetal resorption and delayed fetal ossification) occurred in rabbits and<br/>
rats given doses 4 (rabbits) and 5 (rats) times larger. Adequate and well-controlled studies have not<br/>
been carried out in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of<br/>
human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<br/>
Labor and Delivery<br/>
The effect of torsemide on labor and delivery is unknown.<br/>
Nursing Mothers<br/>
It is not known whether torsemide is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in<br/>
human milk, caution should be exercised when torsemide is administered to a nursing woman.<br/>
Pediatric Use<br/>
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.<br/>
Administration of another loop diuretic to severely premature infants with edema due to patent ductus<br/>
arteriosus and hyaline membrane disease has occasionally been associated with renal calcifications,<br/>
sometimes barely visible on X-ray but sometimes in staghorn form, filling the renal pelves. Some of<br/>
these calculi have been dissolved, and hypercalciuria has been reported to have decreased, when<br/>
chlorothiazide has been coadministered along with the loop diuretic. In other premature neonates with<br/>
hyaline membrane disease, another loop diuretic has been reported to increase the risk of persistent<br/>
patent ductus arteriosus, possibly through a prostaglandin-E-mediated process. The use of torsemide<br/>
in such patients has not been studied.<br/>
Geriatric Use<br/>
Of the total number of patients who received torsemide in United States clinical studies, 24% were 65<br/>
or older while about 4% were 75 or older. No specific age· related differences in effectiveness or safety<br/>
were observed between younger patients and elderly patients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">At the time of approval, torsemide had been evaluated for safety in approximately 4000 subjects: over<br/>
800 of these subjects received torsemide for at least 6 months, and over 380 were treated for more<br/>
than 1 year. Among these subjects were 564 who received torsemide during United States-based trials<br/>
in which 274 other subjects received placebo.<br/>
The reported side effects of torsemide were generally transient, and there was no relationship between<br/>
side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects<br/>
occurred in 3.5% of United States patients treated with torsemide and in 4.4% of patients treated with<br/>
placebo. In studies conducted in the United States and Europe, discontinuation rates due to side effects<br/>
were 3% (38/1250) with torsemide and 3.4% (13/380) with furosemide in patients with congestive heart<br/>
failure, 2% (81409) with torsemide and 4.8% (11/230) with furosemide in patients with renal insufficiency,<br/>
and 7.6% (13/170) with torsemide and 0% (0/33) with furosemide in patients with cirrhosis.<br/>
The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with torsemide were (in descending order<br/>
of frequency) dizziness, headache, nausea, weakness, vomiting, hyperglycemia, excessive urination,<br/>
hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, excessive thirst, hypovolemia, impotence, esophageal hemorrhage, and<br/>
dyspepsia. Dropout rates for these adverse events ranged from 0.1 % to 0.5%.<br/>
The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in United States<br/>
placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with torsemide are shown in Table 1.<br/>

The daily doses of torsemide used in these trials ranged from 1.25 mg to 20 mg, with most patients<br/>
receiving 5 mg to 10 mg; the duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 52 days, with a median of 41 days.<br/>
Of the side effects listed in the table, only "excessive urination" occurred significantly more frequently<br/>
in patients treated with torsemide than in patients treated with placebo. In the placebo-controlled<br/>
hypertension studies whose design allowed side·effect rates to be attributed to dose, excessive<br/>
urination was reported by 1% of patients receiving placebo, 4% of those treated with 5 mg of daily<br/>
torsemide, and 15% of those treated with 10 mg. The complaint of excessive urination was generally<br/>
not reported as an adverse event among patients who received torsemide for cardiac, renal, or hepatic<br/>
failure.<br/>
Serious adverse events reported in the clinical studies for which a drug relationship could not be<br/>
excluded were atrial fibrillation , chest pain, diarrhea, digitalis intoxication, gastrointestinal hemorrhage,<br/>
hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, hypotension, hypovolemia, shunt thrombosis, rash, rectal<br/>
bleeding, syncope, and ventricular tachycardia.<br/>
Angioedema has been reported in a patient exposed to torsemide who was later found to be allergic<br/>
to sulfa drugs.<br/>
Of the adverse reactions during placebo-controlled trials listed without taking into account assessment<br/>
of relatedness to drug therapy, arthritis and various other nonspecific musculoskeletal problems were<br/>
more frequently reported in association with torsemide than with placebo, even though gout was<br/>
somewhat more frequently associated with placebo. These reactions did not increase in frequency or<br/>
severity with the dose of torsemide. One patient in the group treated with torsemide withdrew due to<br/>
myalgia, and one in the placebo group withdrew due to gout.<br/>
Hypokalemia<br/>

<br/></p><h2>Torsemide Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">General: Special dosage adjustment in the elderly is not necessary.<br/>
Because of the high bioavailability of torsemide, oral and intravenous doses are therapeutically<br/>
equivalent, so patients may be switched to and from the intravenous form with no change in dose.<br/>
Torsemide Injection should be administered either slowly as a bolus over a period of 2 minutes or<br/>
administered as a continuous infusion.<br/>
If torsemide is administered through an IV line, it is recommended that, as with other IV injections,<br/>
the IV line be flushed with Normal Saline (Sodium Chloride Injection) before and after administration.<br/>
Torsemide Injection is formulated above pH 8.3. Flushing the line is recommended to avoid the potential<br/>
for incompatibilities caused by differences in pH which could be indicated by color change, haziness or<br/>
the formation of a precipitate in the solution.<br/>
If Torsemide Injection is administered as a continuous infusion, stability has been demonstrated through<br/>
24 hours at room temperature in plastic containers for the following fluids and concentrations:<br/>
200 mg torsemide (10 mg/mL) added to:<br/>
250 mL Dextrose 5% in water<br/>
250 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride<br/>
500 mL 0.45% Sodium Chloride<br/>
50 mg torsemide (10 mg/mL) added to:<br/>
500 mL Dextrose 5% in water<br/>
500 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride<br/>
500 mL 0.45% Sodium Chloride<br/>
Before administration, the solution of Torsemide Injection should be visually inspected for discoloration<br/>
and particulate matter. If either is found, the vial should not be used.<br/>
Congestive Heart Failure<br/>
The usual initial dose is 10 mg or 20 mg of intravenous torsemide. II the diuretic response is inadequate,<br/>
the dose should be titrated upward by approximately doubling until the desired diuretic response is<br/>
obtained. Single doses higher than 200 mg have not been adequately studied.<br/>
Chronic Renal Failure<br/>
The usual initial dose of torsemide is 20 mg of intravenous torsemide. If the diuretic response is<br/>
inadequate, the dose should be titrated upward by approximately doubling until the desired diuretic<br/>
response is obtained. Single doses higher than 200 mg have not been adequately studied.<br/>
Hepatic Cirrhosis<br/>
The usual initial dose is 5 mg or 10 mg of intravenous torsemide, administered together with an<br/>
aldosterone antagonist or a potassium·sparing diuretic. If the diuretic response is inadequate, the dose<br/>
should be titrated upward by approximately doubling until the desired diuretic response is obtained.<br/>
Single doses higher than 40 mg have not been adequately studied.<br/>
Chronic use of any diuretic in hepatic disease has not been studied in adequate and well-controlled<br/>
trials.<br/>
HypertenSion<br/>
The usual initial dose is 5 mg daily. If the 5 mg dose does not provide adequate reduction in blood<br/>
pressure within 4 to 6 weeks, the dose may be increased to 10 mg daily. If the response to 10 mg is<br/>
insufficient, an additional anti-hypertensive agent should be added to the treatment regimen.</p><h2>How is Torsemide Injection Supplied</h2><p class="First">Torsemide Injection 10 mg/mL, is available as follows:<br/>
