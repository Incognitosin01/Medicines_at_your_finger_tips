</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antithyroid Agent</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Pima</h2><p>Potassium iodide is used to treat overactive thyroid and to protect the thyroid gland from the effects of radiation from inhaled or swallowed radioactive iodine. It may be used before and after administration of medicine containing radioactive iodine or after accidental exposure to radioactive iodine (for example, from nuclear power plant accidents that involved release of radioactivity to the environment). It may also be used for other problems as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Potassium iodide is taken by mouth. It may be taken as an oral solution, syrup, uncoated tablet, or enteric-coated delayed-release tablet. However, the delayed-release tablet form may cause serious side effects and its use is generally not recommended.</p><p>Some brands of the oral solution are available without a prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Pima</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you.
