This has occurred in a small number of people taking sildenafil, most of whom also had heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or certain pre-existing eye problems, and in those who smoked or were over 50 years old. It is not clear whether this medicine is the actual cause of vision loss.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. It is not known whether sildenafil will harm an unborn baby. However, having <b>pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)</b> during pregnancy may cause complications such as heart failure, stroke, or medical problems in both mother and baby. The benefit of treating PAH with Revatio may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>It may not be safe to breast-feed while using this medicine. Ask your doctor about any risk.</p><p>Do not give this medication to anyone under 18 years old without medical advice.</p><h2>How should I take Revatio?</h2><p>Take Revatio exactly as it was prescribed for you.

Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>During sexual activity, if you become dizzy or nauseated, or have pain, numbness, or tingling in your chest, arms, neck, or jaw, stop and call your doctor right away.
