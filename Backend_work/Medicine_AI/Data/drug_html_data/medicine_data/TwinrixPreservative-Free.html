This usually occurs by eating food or drinking water that has become contaminated as a result of handling by an infected person.</p><p>Hepatitis B is spread through blood or bodily fluids, sexual contact or sharing IV drug needles with an infected person, or during childbirth when a baby is born to a mother who is infected.</p><p>Hepatitis causes inflammation of the liver, vomiting, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Hepatitis can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis, or death.</p><p>The hepatitis A and B vaccine is used to help prevent these diseases in adults. The vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>This vaccine is recommended for adults with risk factors for getting hepatitis A or B, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>having chronic liver problems, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C, or needing a liver transplant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using intravenous (IV) drugs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>living with a person who has either hepatitis A or B infection;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>having sexual contact with an infected person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>having more than one sex partner in 6 months;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being male and having sex with other men;</p>
</li>
<li>
