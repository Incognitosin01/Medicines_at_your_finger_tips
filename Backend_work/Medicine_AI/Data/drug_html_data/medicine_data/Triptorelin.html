Call your doctor right away if you have a seizure, or any unusual changes in mood or behavior (anger, aggression, crying, feeling restless or irritable).</p><p><b>Triptorelin can cause a temporary increase in certain hormones, especially when you first start using  triptorelin. This may cause side effects that are similar to the condition being treated.</b></p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use this medication if you are allergic to triptorelin or similar drugs such as leuprolide (Lupron, Viadur, Eligard) or goserelin (Zoladex).</p><p><b>Do not use triptorelin if you are pregnant.</b> It could harm the unborn baby.

Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Triptorelin is injected into a muscle.

When using injections by yourself, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine.</p><p>Triptorelin can increase certain hormones when you first start using  triptorelin or after each new injection. This may cause symptoms of prostate cancer or precocious puberty to get worse for a short time. These side effects should get better within 1 to 2 months. <b>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse while using triptorelin.</b></p><p>You may need frequent medical tests.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
