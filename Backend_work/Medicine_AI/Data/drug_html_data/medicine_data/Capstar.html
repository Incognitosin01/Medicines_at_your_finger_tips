If your pet gets re-infested with fleas, you can safely give another dose as often as once per day.  </p><p>To give Capstar Tablets, place the pill directly in your pet’s mouth or hide it in food. If you hide the pill in food, watch closely to make sure your pet swallows the pill. If you are not sure that your pet swallowed the pill, it is safe to give a second pill.</p><p>Treat all infested pets in the household. Fleas can reproduce on untreated pets and allow infestations to persist.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p class="First">Capstar Tablets should be administered according to the following schedule. <span class="Bold">Weigh your pet prior to administration to ensure proper dosage</span>. Do not administer to pets under 2 pounds.</p><p></p><p>*Please see separate insert in this package for concurrent dosing of Capstar Tablets and PROGRAM® (lufenuron) Flavor Tabs®.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Laboratory and clinical studies showed that Capstar Tablets are safe for use in dogs and cats, puppies and kittens 4 weeks of age and older and 2 pounds of body weight or greater.</p><h2>Other Information</h2><p class="First">Capstar Tablets begin working within 30 minutes. In studies, Capstar achieved greater than 90% effectiveness against adult fleas on dogs within 4 hours and cats within 6 hours.</p><p>Capstar Tablets are safe for pregnant or nursing dogs and cats.</p><p>When using this product, you may notice that your dog or cat will start scratching itself as fleas begin to die. The scratching behavior is temporary and is a reaction to the fleas, not the drug. In very rare cases in cats, this may present as transient signs of hyperactivity, panting, vocalization and excessive grooming.</p><p>Capstar Tablets kill adult fleas that cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD).</p><p>Capstar Tablets may be used together with other products, including heartworm preventives, corticosteroids, antibiotics, vaccines, de-worming medications, shampoos and other flea products.</p><h2>Flea Infestations on Dogs and Cats</h2><p class="First">In addition to the common nuisance irritations associated with infestations, fleas can be responsible for skin conditions in your pet such as flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) in the dog and miliary dermatitis in the cat. Also, fleas transmit other parasites, including tapeworms. The control of flea infestations is important to your pet’s health and also reduces the problems associated with these parasites.</p><p>Capstar Tablets do not have an effect on fleas in the pet’s environment. You may need to treat more than one time because immature fleas in and around the home will continue to develop into adults that can reinfest your pet.</p><p>In addition to killing adult fleas with Capstar, you can treat your pet with an insect development inhibitor like PROGRAM Flavor Tabs to prevent and control flea populations. Please see the separate PROGRAM Flavor Tabs/Capstar Tablets FLEA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM insert included in this package for information on how to use these two</p><p>products together to kill adult fleas and prevent flea eggs from hatching. For information on how to use SENTINEL® (milbemycin oxime/lufenuron) Flavor Tabs® (for dogs only) with Capstar Tablets, see your veterinarian.</p><p>The following diagram illustrates the flea’s life cycle and where Capstar Tablets work:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Life Cycle of the Flea</p><p>Fleas can be a problem because they reproduce so rapidly. A single female flea may produce up to 2,000 eggs over her lifetime. Eggs hatch and can develop into adults within only three weeks. Adult female fleas feed by ingesting blood from your pet and subsequently lay eggs, which drop off your pet’s coat. Within days, larvae hatch from the eggs and live undetected in your pet’s surroundings, such as the carpet, bedding and other protected areas. Flea larvae spin a cocoon, and, when appropriately stimulated, a young adult flea emerges and jumps onto your pet to continue the life cycle. When these new fleas are seen on your pet, treat with Capstar Tablets.</p><p>After reading this insert, if you have any questions about flea control or medical problems associated with flea infestations, consult your veterinarian, who is your pet’s health care expert.</p><h2>Storage Conditions</h2><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature, between 59° and 77°F (15°-25°C).</p><p>Questions?

The effects of PROGRAM Flavor Tabs, which prevent and control flea populations, and Capstar Tablets, which treat flea infestations, are combined to provide a FLEA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.</p><h2>Step 1: Prevention and Control</h2><p class="First">Give PROGRAM Flavor Tabs once per month to prevent and control flea populations.

Capstar Tablets contain nitenpyram and are effective for the treatment of flea infestations. Nitenpyram starts killing adult fleas within 30 minutes of administration.</p><ul class="Disc">
