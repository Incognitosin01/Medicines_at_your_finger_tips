The majority of these cases reported the concomitant use of sorbitol. Risk factors for gastrointestinal adverse events were present in many of the cases including prematurity, history of intestinal disease or surgery, hypovolemia, and renal insufficiency and failure. Concomitant administration of sorbitol is not recommended.</p><h3>Electrolyte Disturbances</h3><p class="First">Monitor serum potassium during therapy because severe hypokalemia may occur.</p><p>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is not totally selective for potassium, and small amounts of other cations such as magnesium and calcium can also be lost during treatment. Monitor calcium and magnesium in patients receiving Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension.</p><h3>Fluid Overload in Patients Sensitive to High Sodium Intake</h3><p class="First">Each 15 g dose of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension contains 1500 mg (60 mEq) of sodium. Monitor patients who are sensitive to sodium intake (heart failure, hypertension, edema) for signs of fluid overload. Adjustment of other sources of sodium may be required.</p><h3>Risk of Aspiration</h3><p class="First">Cases of acute bronchitis or bronchopneumonia caused by inhalation of sodium polystyrene sulfonate particles have been reported. Patients with impaired gag reflex, altered level of consciousness, or patients prone to regurgitation may be at increased risk. Administer Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension with the patient in an upright position.</p><h3>Binding to Other Orally Administered Medications</h3><p class="First">Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension may bind orally administered medications, which could decrease their gastrointestinal absorption and lead to reduced efficacy. Administer other oral medications at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension. Patients with gastroparesis may require a 6 hour separation. <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:</p><p>● Intestinal Necrosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>● Electrolyte Disturbances <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2,5.3)]</span></p><p>● Aspiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></p><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, fecal impaction, gastrointestinal concretions (bezoars), ischemic colitis, nausea, ulcerations, vomiting, gastric irritation, intestinal obstruction (due to concentration of aluminium hydroxide)</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic:</span> systemic alkalosis</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>General Interactions</h3><p class="First">No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted in humans.</p><p>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension has the potential to bind other drugs. In in vitro binding studies, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension was shown to significantly bind the oral medications (n=6) that were tested. Decreased absorption of lithium and thyroxine have also been reported with co-administration of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension. Binding of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension to other oral medications could cause decreased gastrointestinal absorption and loss of efficacy when taken close to the time Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is administered. Administer Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after other oral medications. Patients with gastroparesis may require a 6 hour separation. Monitor for clinical response and/or blood levels where possible.</p><h3>Cation-Donating Antacids</h3><p class="First">The simultaneous oral administration of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension with nonabsorbable cation-donating antacids and laxatives may reduce the resin's potassium exchange capability and increase the risk of systemic alkalosis</p><h3>Sorbitol</h3><p class="First">Sorbitol may contribute to the risk of intestinal necrosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> and concomitant use is not recommended.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is not absorbed systemically following oral or rectal administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal risk.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is not absorbed systemically by the mother, so breastfeeding is not expected to result in risk to the infant.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Studies of safety and efficacy have not been conducted in pediatric patients.</p><p>In pediatric patients, as in adults, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is expected to bind potassium at the practical exchange ratio of 1mEq potassium per 1 gram of resin.</p><p>In neonates, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension should not be given by the oral route. In both children and neonates, excessive dosage or inadequate dilution could result in impaction of the resin. Premature infants or low birth weight infants may have an increased risk for gastrointestinal adverse effects with Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension use <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage may result in electrolyte disturbances including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Appropriate measures should be taken to correct serum electrolytes (potassium, calcium, magnesium), and the resin should be removed from the alimentary tract by appropriate use of laxatives or enemas.</p><h2>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Oral Powder Description</h2><p class="First">Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is a benzene, diethenyl-polymer, with ethenylbenzene, sulfonated, sodium salt and has the following structural formula:</p><p>The drug is a cream to light brown finely ground, powdered form of sodium polystyrene sulfonate, a cation-exchange resin prepared in the sodium phase with an in vitro exchange capacity of approximately 3.1 mEq (<span class="Italics">in vivo</span> approximately 1 mEq) of potassium per gram. The sodium content is approximately 100 mg (4.1 mEq) per gram of the drug. It can be administered orally or rectally as an enema.</p><p>One gram of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension contains 4.1 mEq of sodium.</p><h2>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Oral Powder - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is a non-absorbed, cation exchange polymer that contains a sodium counterion.</p><p>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen, resulting in a reduction of serum potassium levels. The practical exchange ratio is 1 mEq K per 1 gram of resin.</p><p>As the resin passes along the intestine or is retained in the colon after administration by enema, the sodium ions are partially released and are replaced by potassium ions. This action occurs primarily in the large intestine, which excretes potassium ions to a greater degree than does the small intestine. The efficiency of this process is limited and unpredictably variable.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The effective lowering of serum potassium with Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension may take hours to days.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> efficiency of sodium-potassium exchange resins is approximately 33 percent; hence, about one third of the resin's actual sodium content is delivered to the body.</p><p>Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is not absorbed systemically.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> binding studies showed that Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension bound significantly to the following tested drugs - warfarin, metoprolol, phenytoin, furosemide, amlodipine and amoxicillin.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Studies have not been performed.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is available as a cream to light brown, finely ground powder in jars of 1 pound (453.6 g). NDC 42806-013-96.</p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Advise patients who are taking other oral medication to separate the dosing of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension by at least 3 hours (before or after) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1),Warnings and Precautions (5.5), and Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p>Manufactured by:</p><p>Epic Pharma, LLC</p><p>Laurelton, NY 11413</p><p>Rev. 10-2017-00</p><p>MF013REV10/17</p><p>OE1063</p><h2>PACKAGE/LABEL PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL – 453.6 g</h2><h2>More about sodium polystyrene sulfonate</h2><ul class="more-resources-list more-resources-list-general">
