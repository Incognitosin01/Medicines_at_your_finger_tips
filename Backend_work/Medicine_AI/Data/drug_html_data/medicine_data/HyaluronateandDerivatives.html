Sodium hyaluronate and its derivatives form a viscoelastic solution in water (at physiological pH and ionic strength) which makes it suitable for aqueous and vitreous humor in ophthalmic surgery, and functions as a tissue and/or joint lubricant which plays an important role in modulating the interactions between adjacent tissues. Intradermal injection may decrease the depth of facial wrinkles. Transcutaneous injection for lip augmentation may correct perioral rhytids. Subcutaneous and/or supraperiosteal injection for cheek or chin augmentation may correct age-related volume deficit. In the topical management of wounds and ulcers, sodium hyaluronate protects the skin against friction and abrasion.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>Intravitreous injection: Diffusion occurs slowly</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Ophthalmic: Via Canal of Schlemm</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Intra-articular injection:</b> Treatment of pain in osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed nonpharmacologic treatment or simple analgesics (Durolane, Euflexxa, Gel-One, Gelsyn-3, GenVisc 850, Hyalgan, Hymovis, Monovisc, OrthoVisc, Supartz, Supartz FX, Synvisc, Synvisc-One, Triluron, TriVisc, Visco-3) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Gel-One).</p><p><b>Intradermal:</b></p><p>Juvederm (all formulations except Volbella XC and Voluma XC), Perlane, Restylane, Restylane Defyne, Restylane Lyft, Restylane-L, Restylane Refyne: Correction of moderate to severe facial wrinkles or folds.</p><p>Juvederm Volbella XC, Restylane Kysse, and Restylane Silk: Correction of perioral rhytids in adults &gt;21 years.</p><p><b>Subcutaneous: </b>Restylane Lyft: Correction of volume deficit of the dorsal hand in adults &gt;21 years.</p><p><b>Subcutaneous/supraperiosteal: </b>Juvederm Voluma XC, Restylane Lyft: Correction of age-related volume deficit for cheek augmentation in the mid-face in adults &gt;21 years;

Treatment may result in bruising/bleeding; use caution in patients with bleeding disorders and patients receiving or recently exposed (≤3 weeks) to thrombolytics, anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors, or NSAIDs. Do not inject into site of active inflammation (skin eruptions such as cysts, pimples, rashes, or hives) or infection. Injection into a blood vessel may cause localized superficial necrosis or may cause occlusion and lead to embolism, ischemia, or infarction. Symptoms of vascular occlusion or embolization (eg, pain disproportionate to the procedure or remote from the injection site, immediate blanching extending beyond the injected area, dusky or reticular-appearing tissue) require intervention. Use of Juvederm in patients susceptible to keloid formation, hypertrophic scarring, or pigmentation disorders has not been studied; use cautiously. Hyperpigmentation at the injection site has been reported with some formulations and may last for ≤6 weeks after treatment; keloid formation may also occur. Use caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Use in patients with prior herpetic eruption may result in reactivation. Delayed inflammatory papules may result from injections, necessitating evaluation and treatment as soft tissue infection. If laser treatment, chemical peeling, or any other procedure based on an active dermal response is considered after treatment, there is a risk of acute inflammatory reaction at the injection site if performed following intradermal treatment and before the skin has healed completely. The safety of treatment with concomitant dermal therapies such as epilation, UV irradiation, or laser, mechanical, or chemical peeling procedures has not been evaluated. Patient must avoid exposure to UV rays (sun and UV lamp) or severe cold until swelling and redness is resolved.</p><p>- For facial administration, do not use in vascular-rich areas, such as glabella and nose; rare but serious adverse events associated with the intravascular injection of soft tissue fillers in the face have been reported and include temporary or permanent vision impairment, blindness, cerebral ischemia or cerebral hemorrhage leading to stroke, skin necrosis, and damage to underlying facial structures. Immediately stop the injection if a patient exhibits any of the following symptoms, including changes in vision, signs of a stroke, blanching of the skin, or unusual pain during or shortly after the procedure. Treatment site reactions usually improve in ≤7 days (chin augmentation, nasolabial folds), &lt;18 days (lips), or &lt;4 weeks (cheek augmentation). Strenuous exercise and ethanol consumption should be avoided for 24 hours following use. Supplemental "touch up" treatments may be required. Use of larger than recommended volumes per injection result in an increase in adverse events; if larger amounts are needed, follow-up treatment sessions are recommended.</p><p>- For dorsal hand administration, avoid injection into veins or tendons of the hand; may weaken tendons or cause tendons to rupture or cause embolization or thrombosis of veins. Use with caution in patients with disabilities, diseases, or injuries of the hand, including autoimmune diseases affecting the hand, hand implants, Dupuytren's contracture, history of hand tumor, vascular malformations, Raynaud disease and patients at risk for tendon rupture; use has not been studied. Injection of the dorsum of the hand may cause pain and swelling. Treatment site reactions (eg, redness, swelling, tenderness, pain) usually improve in ≤7 days. Increased risk for delayed onset adverse reactions may occur with strenuous use of hands or trauma to hands after injection into the hand. Reduced thumb flexion range lasting &gt;3 months has been reported.</p><p>• Injection (gel, solution): Intra-articular: Not for use in infected joints; do not use disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium salts for skin preparation (may cause precipitation of hyaluronate). Remove synovial fluid or effusion, if present, prior to injection; do not use in cases of severe intra-articular effusion. Do not inject intravascularly, extra-articularly, or into synovium. Use with caution if venous or lymphatic stasis is present in the leg. Transient increases in reddening or inflammation, pain, or sensation of heat may occur after injection into the knee in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Avoid strenuous or prolonged weight bearing activities for 48 hours after injection. Some products are produced from avian sources; use with caution in patients with hypersensitivity to avian proteins, feathers, or egg products. Use Gel-One with caution in patients allergic to cinnamon. Use Durolane with caution in patients with preexisting chondrocalcinosis; may cause acute attack.</p><p>• Latex: Some products may contain natural latex rubber.</p><p>• Ophthalmic: Do not overfill the anterior chamber. Postoperative increases in intraocular pressure have occurred following use of sodium hyaluronate; remove from the anterior chamber at the end of surgery and monitor intraocular pressure closely. Mixing of quaternary ammonium salts (eg, benzalkonium chloride) with sodium hyaluronate results in the formation of a precipitate; do not irrigate the eye with any solution containing benzalkonium chloride during surgery.</p><p>• Topical: Bionect products (cream, gel): Do not use disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium salts for skin preparation (may cause precipitation of hyaluronate).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate patient selection: Juvederm Voluma XC: Safety for use in patients &lt;35 years or &gt;65 years of age (cheek augmentation) and &lt;22 years or &gt;80 years of age (chin augmentation) or with very thin skin in the mid-face region has not been established.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Chin augmentation: Treatment in the chin region may be obscured by skin laxity of the chin, neck, or jaw; has not been studied in patients with significant chin, neck, or jaw skin laxity. Effect on chin facial hair growth has not been studied.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Juvederm Voluma XC: Safety of cannula injection for cheek augmentation in patients with Fitzpatrick Skin Types V and VI has not been established.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Restylane Defyne, Restylane Refyne: Do not inject in a site that has been treated with a permanent implant.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Restylane Lyft: Safety and effectiveness for treatment beyond one year has not been established.</p><p>• Experienced physician: Should be administered by an experienced health care provider who has appropriate training, experience, knowledge of anatomy at injection site, and knowledge of aseptic technique.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Intraocular pressure (ophthalmic formulations); signs and symptoms of excess local inflammation or infection (intradermal formulations)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events were not observed in animal reproduction studies.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p><b>For use in the eye:</b></p><p>• It is used for eye surgeries.</p><p><b>Injection (when given in the knee):</b></p><p>• It is used to treat arthritis of the knee.</p><p><b>All skin products:</b></p><p>• It is used to promote healing of skin ulcers and wounds.</p><p><b>All products:</b></p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
