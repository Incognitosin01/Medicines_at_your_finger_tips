It inhibits HER2 dimerization and blocks HER downstream, signaling halting cell growth and initiating apoptosis. Pertuzumab binds to a different HER2 epitope than trastuzumab so that when pertuzumab is combined with trastuzumab, a more complete inhibition of HER2 signaling occurs (Baselga 2012).</p><p>Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of HER2; it mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by inhibiting proliferation of cells that overexpress HER2 protein.</p><p>Hyaluronidase increases the dispersion and absorption rate of SubQ trastuzumab-containing products by increasing permeability of SubQ tissue through temporary depolymerization of hyaluronan; at the recommended doses, hyaluronidase acts transiently and locally; permeability of the SubQ tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>SubQ: Pertuzumab: 2.8 L; Trastuzumab: 2.9 L.</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Clearance: Linear: SubQ: Pertuzumab: 0.2 L/day; Trastuzumab: 0.1 L/day.</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>SubQ: Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab: 4 days.</p><h2>Special Populations Note</h2><p>Body weight: While not clinically relevant, body weight demonstrated a statistically significant influence on pharmacokinetics.

The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. Evaluate cardiac function prior to and during pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase treatment. Discontinue pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase in patients receiving adjuvant therapy, and withhold pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function.</b> Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death. Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may also result in an asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline. Patients who received IV pertuzumab, IV trastuzumab, and docetaxel experienced an increased incidence of LVEF decline. Among patients receiving trastuzumab, there is a 4- to 6-fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction compared to patients not receiving trastuzumab. The highest absolute incidence occurs when trastuzumab is administered with an anthracycline. If an anthracycline-based regimen is indicated, pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase should not begin until after anthracycline therapy is completed. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and/or IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab have not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF of &lt;55% (in early breast cancer) or &lt;50% (in metastatic breast cancer), a prior history of heart failure, conditions that could impair LVEF such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction (MI), serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure of &gt;360 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of doxorubicin (or equivalent). Conduct a thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and LVEF assessment (by ECG or MUGA scan) prior to treatment initiation. Assess LVEF immediately prior to pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase initiation, every 3 months during pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase therapy, every 3 weeks if pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, and every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of adjuvant pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase therapy. Cardiotoxicity may require therapy interruption and/or permanent discontinuation.</p><p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has developed guidelines for prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in adult survivors of cancer (ASCO [Armenian 2017]). According to the guidelines, the risk of cardiac dysfunction related to trastuzumab is increased with the following:</p><p>- Trastuzumab alone AND any of the following risk factors: multiple cardiovascular risk factors (≥2 risk factors), including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity (during or after completion of therapy), or older age (≥60 years of age) at cancer treatment, or compromised cardiac function (eg, borderline low LVEF [50% to 55%], history of MI, moderate or higher valvular heart disease) before or during treatment.</p><p>- Treatment with lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) followed by trastuzumab (sequential therapy).</p><p>The ASCO guidelines recommend a comprehensive assessment in patients with cancer that includes a history and physical examination and screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. An ECG should be obtained prior to initiating potentially cardiotoxic therapies. Modifiable risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity) should be actively managed before initiating potentially cardiotoxic therapies. In patients who develop signs/symptoms of cardiac dysfunction during therapy, in addition to the above LVEF monitoring recommendations, an ECG is recommended for diagnostic workup; if ECG is not available or feasible, a cardiac MRI (preferred) or MUGA scan may be utilized. Serum cardiac biomarkers are recommended, along with referral to a cardiologist if indicated. Routine ECG surveillance may be utilized in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving trastuzumab indefinitely.</p><p>• Hepatitis B virus reactivation: The ASCO hepatitis B screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Severe administration-related reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and fatal outcomes, have been reported with pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase. Patients with dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and/or comorbidities may be at increased risk of a severe or fatal adverse reaction. The most common administration-related reactions with pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase were injection-site reactions and injection-site pain. Serious and fatal reactions have been reported with IV trastuzumab products. Closely monitor for systemic hypersensitivity reactions, particularly with the initial dose (monitor for at least 30 minutes after initial dose and 15 minutes after maintenance doses). If a significant administration-related reaction occurs, slow down or pause the injection and initiate appropriate medical management. Permanently discontinue pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase in patients who experience anaphylaxis or severe administration-related reactions. Medications to treat anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity and emergency equipment should be available for immediate use. Consider premedication with an analgesic, antipyretic, or an antihistamine prior to subsequent pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase doses in patients who experienced a reversible grade 1 or 2 hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p>• Pulmonary toxicity: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Discontinue pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Monitor until symptoms completely resolve. </b>Pulmonary toxicity reported with trastuzumab includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, ARDS, and pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive pulmonary tumor involvement, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe pulmonary toxicity.</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues: </b></i></p><p>• Chemotherapy: Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may increase the incidence of neutropenia when used in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The incidences of grades 3 and 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving IV trastuzumab (compared to those who received chemotherapy alone).</p><p>• Drug-drug interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy. Consult drug interactions database for more detailed information.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Pregnancy: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Exposure to pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase during pregnancy can result in embryo-fetal death and birth defects. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.</b></p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Do not interchange: Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and conventional trastuzumab products, trastuzumab/hyaluronidase, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan, or pertuzumab are <b>not</b> interchangeable. Verify product label prior to reconstitution and administration to prevent medication errors. Dosing and treatment schedules differ between pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and conventional trastuzumab (Herceptin or trastuzumab biosimilars), trastuzumab/hyaluronidase (Herceptin Hylecta), ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu), or pertuzumab (Perjeta).</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• HER2 expression: Establish HER2 status prior to treatment with an approved test, either HER2 protein overexpression or gene amplification in tumor specimens. Tests appropriate for breast cancer should be used to assess HER2 status. Unreliable results may occur from improper assay performance, such as use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, or incorrectly following specific assay instructions. Information regarding HER2 diagnostic testing may be found at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Assess for HER2 overexpression and HER2 gene amplification by validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methodology (pretherapy) specific for breast cancer. Evaluate pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation (in females of reproductive potential). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) prior to beginning systemic anticancer therapy (ASCO [Hwang 2020]). Conduct a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment prior to treatment initiation, including a history and physical examination. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline and at regular intervals during therapy; if treatment is withheld for significant LVEF dysfunction, monitor LVEF at 3-week intervals. When used for adjuvant therapy, continue to monitor for cardiomyopathy and assess LVEF every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of treatment. Monitor for signs/symptoms of cardiomyopathy and/or pulmonary toxicity. Monitor closely for at least 30 minutes after initial dose and 15 minutes after maintenance doses for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity and/or administration-related reactions; if a reaction occurs, monitor carefully until symptoms resolve completely.</p><p>Additional cardiovascular monitoring (ASCO [Armenian 2017]): Screen for cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking.
