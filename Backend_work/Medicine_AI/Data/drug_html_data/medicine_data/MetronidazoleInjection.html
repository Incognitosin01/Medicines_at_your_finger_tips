</ul><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the e ffectiveness of Metronidazole Injection USP and other antibacterial drugs, Metronidazole Injection USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.</p><p class="First">Metronidazole has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>). Its use, therefore, should be reserved for the conditions described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section below.</p><h2>Metronidazole Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Metronidazole Injection USP is a sterile, parenteral dosage form of metronidazole in water.<br/>
<br/>
Each 100 mL of Metronidazole Injection USP contains a sterile, nonpyrogenic, isotonic, buffered solution of Metronidazole USP 500 mg, Sodium Chloride USP 740 mg, Dibasic Sodium Phosphate•7H<span class="Sub">2</span>O USP 112 mg, and Citric Acid Anhydrous USP 40 mg in Water for Injection USP. Metronidazole Injection USP has a calculated osmolarity of 297 mOsmol/liter and a pH of 5.8 (4.5–7.0). Sodium content: 13.5 mEq/container.<br/>
Metronidazole is classified as a nitroimidazole antimicrobial and is administered by the intravenous route. Metronidazole USP is chemically designated 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole-1-ethanol (C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">9</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>):</p><p>Not made with natural rubber latex, PVC or DEHP.<br/>
<br/>
The plastic container is polypropylene formulated and developed for parenteral drugs. The copolymer contains no plasticizers. The safety of the plastic container has been confirmed by biological evaluation procedures.<br/>
<br/>
The material passes Class VI testing as specified in the U.S. Pharmacopeia for Biological Tests–Plastic Containers. The container/solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration.</p><h2>Metronidazole Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Metronidazole is a synthetic antibacterial compound. Disposition of metronidazole in the body is similar for both oral and intravenous dosage forms, with an average elimination half-life in healthy humans of eight hours.<br/>
The major route of elimination of metronidazole and its metabolites is via the urine (60 to 80% of the dose), with fecal excretion accounting for 6 to 15% of the dose. The metabolites that appear in the urine result primarily from side-chain oxidation (1-[β-hydroxyethyl]-2-hydroxymethyl-5-nitroimidazole and 2-methyl-5- nitroimidazole-1-yl-acetic acid) and glucuronide conjugation, with unchanged metronidazole accounting for approximately 20% of the total. Renal clearance of metronidazole is approximately 10 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>.<br/>
Metronidazole is the major component appearing in the plasma, with lesser quantities of the 2-hydroxymethyl metabolite also being present. Less than 20% of the circulating metronidazole is bound to plasma proteins. Both the parent compound and the metabolite possess in vitro bactericidal activity against most strains of anaerobic bacteria.<br/>
Metronidazole appears in cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and human milk in concentrations similar to those found in plasma. Bactericidal concentrations of metronidazole have also been detected in pus from hepatic abscesses.<br/>
Plasma concentrations of metronidazole are proportional to the administered dose. An eight-hour intravenous infusion of 100 to 4,000 mg of metronidazole in normal subjects showed a linear relationship between dose and peak plasma concentration.<br/>
In patients treated with Metronidazole Injection using a dosage regimen of 15 mg/kg loading dose followed six hours later by 7.5 mg/kg every six hours, peak steady- state plasma concentrations of metronidazole averaged 25 mcg/mL with trough (minimum) concentrations averaging 18 mcg/mL.<br/>
Decreased renal function does not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of metronidazole. However, plasma clearance of metronidazole is decreased in patients with decreased liver function.<br/>
In one study newborn infants appeared to demonstrate diminished capacity to eliminate metronidazole. The elimination half-life, measured during the first three days of life, was inversely related to gestational age. In infants whose gestational ages were between 28 and 40 weeks, the corresponding elimination half-lives ranged from 109 to 22.5 hours.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">MICROBIOLOGY</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span><br/>
Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole, exerts antibacterial effects in an anaerobic environment against most obligate anaerobes. Once metronidazole enters the organism by passive diffusion and activated in the cytoplasm of susceptible anaerobic bacteria, it is reduced; this process includes intra-cellular electron transport donors such as ferredoxin and transfer of an electron to the nitro group of the metronidazole leading to formation of a short-lived nitroso free radical. Because of this alteration of the metronidazole molecule, a concentration gradient is created and maintained which promotes the drug’s intracellular transport. The reduced form of metronidazole and free radicals may interact with DNA leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis, DNA degradation, and death of bacteria. The precise mechanism of action of metronidazole is unclear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Drug Resistance</span><br/>
A potential for development of resistance exists against metronidazole.<br/>
Resistance may be due to multiple mechanisms that include decreased uptake of the drug, altered reduction efficiency, overexpression of the efflux pumps, inactivation of the drug, and/or increased DNA damage repair.<br/>
Metronidazole does not possess any clinically relevant activity against facultative anaerobes or obligate aerobes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Antimicrobial Activity</span><br/>

If there are signs of infection, specimens for cultures should be obtained for the identification of the causative organism(s) so that appropriate therapy may be given (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTR ATION</span>).</p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the e ffectiveness of metronidazole and other antibacterial drugs, metronidazole should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Metronidazole Injection USP is contraindicated in patients with a prior history of hypersensitivity to metronidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECTS</span></p><p>Convulsive seizures, encephalopath y, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropath y, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremit y, have been reported in patients treated with metronidazole. The appearance of abnormal neurologic signs demands the prompt evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio of the continuation of therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY AND DE ATH IN PATIENTS WITH COCK AYNE SYNDROME</span></p><p>Cases of severe hepatotoxicity/acute hepatic failure, including cases with a fatal outcome with very rapid onset after treatment initiation in patients with Cockayne syndrome have been reported with products containing metronidazole for systemic use. In this population, metronidazole should therefore be used after careful benefit- risk assessment and only if no alternative treatment is available. Obtain liver function tests prior to the start of therap y, within the first 2-3 days after initiation of therap y, frequently during therapy and after end of treatment. Discontinue metronidazole if elevation of liver function occurs, and monitor liver function tests until the baseline values are reached.</p><p>Advise patients with Cockayne syndrome to stop taking metronidazole immediately if they experience any symptoms of potential liver injur y, such as abdominal pain, nausea, change in stool color or jaundice, and to contact their healthcare provider.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>GENERAL</h3><p class="First">Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowl y, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in the plasma. Accordingl y, for such patients, doses below those usually recommended should be administered cautiousl y.</p><p>Administration of solutions containing sodium ions may result in sodium retention. Care should be taken when administering Metronidazole Injection USP to patients receiving corticosteroids or to patients predisposed to edema.</p><p>Known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with Metronidazole Injection USP and requires treatment with a candicidal agent.</p><p>Prescribing Metronidazole Injection USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</h3><p class="First">Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Metronidazole Injection USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (<span class="Italics">e.g.,</span> the common cold). When Metronidazole Injection USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therap y, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the e ffectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Metronidazole Injection USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><h3>LABORATORY TESTS</h3><p class="First">Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole, and Metronidazole Injection USP should be used with caution in patients with evidence of or history of blood dyscrasia. A mild leukopenia has been observed during its administration; howeve r, no persistent hematologic abnormalities attributable to metronidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and di fferential leukocyte counts are recommended before and after therapy.</p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First">Metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant e ffect of warfarin and other oral coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. This possible drug interaction should be considered when Metronidazole Injection USP is prescribed for patients on this type of anticoagulant therapy.<br/>
<br/>
The simultaneous administration of drugs that induce microsomal liver enzymes, such as phenytoin or phenobarbital, may accelerate the elimination of metronidazole, resulting in reduced plasma levels; impaired clearance of phenytoin has also been reported.<br/>
<br/>
The simultaneous administration of drugs that decrease microsomal liver enzyme activity, such as cimetidine, may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole.<br/>
<br/>
Alcoholic beverages should not be consumed during metronidazole therapy because abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing may occur. Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients who are using metronidazole and disulfiram concurrently. Metronidazole should not be given to patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks.</p><h3>DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS</h3><p class="First">Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and hexokinase glucose. Values of zero may be observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ NADH). Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole (322 nm) at pH 7.</p><h3>CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T</span><span class="Bold">umorigenicity in Rodents</span></p><p>Metronidazole has shown evidence of carcinogenic activity in studies involving chronic, oral administration in mice and rats, but similar studies in the hamster gave negative results. Also, metronidazole has shown mutagenic activity in a number of <span class="Italics">in vit ro</span> assay systems, but studies in mammals (<span class="Italics">in vivo</span>) failed to demonstrate a potential for genetic damage.</p><h3>PREGNANCY</h3><p class="First">Teratogenic Effects<br/>
<br/>
Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation rapidl y. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to five times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metronidazole. Metronidazole administered intraperitoneally to pregnant mice at approximately the human dose caused fetotoxicity; administered orally to pregnant mice, no fetotoxicity was observed. There are, howeve r, no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and because metronidazole is a carcinogen in rodents, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDIC ATIONS</span>).</p><h3>NURSING MOTHERS</h3><p class="First">Metronidazole is secreted in human milk in concentrations similar to those found in plasma. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for metronidazole in mouse and rat studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>PEDIATRIC USE</h3><p class="First">Safety and e ffectiveness in children have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Metronidazole Injection have been convulsive seizures, encephalopath y, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropath y, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremit y. Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged oral administration of metronidazole, patients should be observed carefully if neurologic symptoms occur and a prompt evaluation made of the benefit/risk ratio of the continuation of therap y.</p><p>The following reactions have also been reported during treatment with Metronidazole Injection:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">GASTROINTESTINAL:</span></span> Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and an unpleasant metallic taste.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">HEMATOPOIETIC:</span></span> Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">DERMATOLOGIC:</span></span> Erythematous rash and pruritus.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">CENTRAL NE RVOUS SYSTEM:</span></span> Encephalopath y, aseptic meningitis, convulsive seizures, optic neuropath y, peripheral neuropath y, dizziness, vertigo, incoordination, ataxia, confusion, psychosis, dysarthria, irritabilit y, depression, weakness, and insomnia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">LOCAL REACTIONS:</span></span> Thrombophlebitis after intravenous infusion. This reaction can be minimized or avoided by avoiding prolonged use of indwelling intravenous catheters.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">OTHER:</span></span> Fever. Instances of darkened urine have also been reported, and this manifestation has been the subject of a special investigation. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified, it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been reported during treatment with oral metronidazole:</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">GASTROINTESTINAL:</span></span> Nausea, sometimes accompanied by headache, anorexia, and occasionally vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, and constipation.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">MOUTH:</span></span> A sharp, unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue, glossitis, and stomatitis have occurred; these may be associated with a sudden ove rgrowth of <span class="Italics">Candida</span> which may occur during e ffective therap y.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">HEMATOPOIETIC:</span></span></span></span> Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia); rarel y, reversible thrombocytopenia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">CARDIOVASCULAR:</span></span> Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">CENTRAL NE RVOUS SYSTEM:</span></span> Encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, convulsive seizures, optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, vertigo, incoordination, ataxia, confusion, psychosis, dysarthria, irritabilit y, depression, weakness, and insomnia.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">HYPERSENSITIVIT Y:</span></span> Urticaria, erythematous rash, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, flushing, nasal congestion, dryness of mouth (or vagina or vulva), and fever.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">RENAL:</span></span> Dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, incontinence, a sense of pelvic pressure, and darkened urine.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">OTHER:</span></span> Hiccup. Proliferation of <span class="Italics">Candida</span> in the vagina, dyspareunia, decrease of libido, proctitis, and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling "serum sickness". If patients receiving metronidazole drink alcoholic beverages, they may experience abdominal distress, nausea, vomiting, flushing, or headache. A modification of the taste of alcoholic beverages has also been reported.</p><p>Crohn's disease patients are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers. There have been some reports in the medical literature of breast and colon cancer in Crohn's disease patients who have been treated with metronidazole at high doses for extended periods of time. A cause and e ffect relationship has not been established. Crohn's disease is not an approved indication for Metronidazole Injection USP.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The use of dosages of metronidazole higher than those recommended has been reported. These include the use of 27 mg/kg three times a day for 20 days, and the use of 75 mg/kg as a single loading dose followed by 7.5 mg/kg maintenance doses. No adverse reactions were reported in either of the two cases.</p><p>Single oral doses of metronidazole, up to 15 g, have been reported in suicide attempts and accidental overdoses. Symptoms reported include nausea, vomiting, and ataxia.</p><p>Oral metronidazole has been studied as a radiation sensitizer in the treatment of malignant tumors. Neurotoxic e ffects, including seizures and peripheral neuropath y, have been reported after 5 to 7 days of doses of 6 to 10.4 g every other day.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">TREATMENT</span></p><p>There is no specific antidote for overdose; therefore, management of the patient should consist of symptomatic and supportive therapy.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">In elderly  patients  the  pharmacokinetics  of metronidazole  may  be  altered  and  therefore  monitoring  of serum  levels  may  be  necessary  to  adjust  the  metronidazole  dosage accordingly.<br/>
<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">TRE ATMENT  OF  ANAEROBIC INFECTIONS</span> </p><p>The  recommended  dosage  schedule  for <span class="Bold">Adults</span> is:<br/></p><p>Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in the plasma. Accordingly, for such patients, doses below those usually recommended should be administered cautiously. Close monitoring of plasma metronidazole levels and toxicity is recommended.<span class="Sup">3</span><br/>
In patients receiving Metronidazole Injection in whom gastric secretions are continuously removed by nasogastric aspiration, sufficient metronidazole may be removed in the aspirate to cause a reduction in serum levels.<br/>
The dose of Metronidazole Injection USP should not be specifically reduced in anuric patients since accumulated metabolites may be rapidly removed by dialysis. The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">PROPHYLAXIS</span><br/>
For surgical prophylactic use, to prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated colorectal surgery, the recommended dosage schedule for adults is:<br/>
a. 15 mg/kg infused over 30 to 60 minutes and completed approximately one hour before surgery, followed by:<br/>
b. 7.5 mg/kg infused over 30 to 60 minutes at 6 and 12 hours after the initial dose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is important that (1) administration of the initial preoperative dose be completed approximately one hour before surgery so that adequate drug levels are present in the serum and tissues at the time of initial incision, and (2) Metronidazole Injection USP be administered, if necessary, at 6-hour intervals to maintain effective drug levels. Prophylactic use of Metronidazole Injection USP should be limited to the day of surgery only, following the above guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parenteral therapy may be changed to oral metronidazole when conditions warrant, based upon the severity of the disease and the response of the patient to treatment with Metronidazole Injection USP. The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
