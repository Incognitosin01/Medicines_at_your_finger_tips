IMRALDI can be used alone or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).</p><h3>Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</h3><p class="First">IMRALDI is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients from 4 to 17 years of age and ≥ 30 kg (66 lbs). IMRALDI can be used alone or in combination with methotrexate.</p><h3>Psoriatic Arthritis</h3><p class="First">IMRALDI is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. IMRALDI can be used alone or in combination with non-biologic DMARDs.</p><h3>Ankylosing Spondylitis</h3><p class="First">IMRALDI is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.</p><h3>Adult Crohn's Disease</h3><p class="First">IMRALDI is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. IMRALDI is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms and inducing clinical remission in these patients if they have also lost response to or are intolerant to infliximab.</p><h3>Ulcerative Colitis</h3><p class="First">IMRALDI is indicated for inducing and sustaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). The effectiveness of adalimumab has not been established in patients who have lost response to or were intolerant to TNF blockers <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.7)]</span>.</p><h3>Plaque Psoriasis</h3><p class="First">IMRALDI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. IMRALDI should only be administered to patients who will be closely monitored and have regular follow-up visits with a physician <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</p><h2>Imraldi Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">IMRALDI is administered by subcutaneous injection.</p><h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of IMRALDI for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is 40 mg administered every other week. Methotrexate (MTX), other non-biologic DMARDS, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and/or analgesics may be continued during treatment with IMRALDI. In the treatment of RA, some patients not taking concomitant MTX may derive additional benefit from increasing the dosing frequency of IMRALDI to 40 mg every week.</p><h3>Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of IMRALDI for patients from 4 years of age and ≥ 30 kg(66 lbs) with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is 40 mg administered every other week via subcutaneous injection. MTX, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, and/or analgesics may be continued during treatment with IMRALDI.</p><p>Adalimumab has not been studied in patients with polyarticular JIA less than 2 years of age or in patients with a weight below 10 kg.</p><h3>Adult Crohn's Disease</h3><p class="First">The recommended IMRALDI dose regimen for adult patients with Crohn's disease (CD) is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks later (Day 29) begin a maintenance dose of 40 mg every other week. Aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids may be continued during treatment with IMRALDI. Azathioprine, 6- mercaptopurine (6-MP) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> or MTX may be continued during treatment with IMRALDI if necessary. The use of adalimumab in CD beyond one year has not been evaluated in controlled clinical studies.</p><h3>Ulcerative Colitis</h3><p class="First">The recommended IMRALDI dose regimen for adult patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given as four 40 mg injections in one day or as two 40 mg injections per day for two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks later (Day 29) continue with a dose of 40 mg every other week.</p><p>Only continue IMRALDI in patients who have shown evidence of clinical remission by eight weeks (Day 57) of therapy. Aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids may be continued during treatment with IMRALDI. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> may be continued during treatment with IMRALDI if necessary.</p><h3>Plaque Psoriasis</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose of IMRALDI for adult patients with plaque psoriasis (Ps) is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The use of adalimumab in moderate to severe chronic Ps beyond one year has not been evaluated in controlled clinical studies.</p><h3>Monitoring to Assess Safety</h3><p class="First">Prior to initiating IMRALDI and periodically during therapy, evaluate patients for active tuberculosis and test for latent infection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h3>General Considerations for Administration</h3><p class="First">IMRALDI is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. A patient may self-inject IMRALDI or a caregiver may inject IMRALDI using the IMRALDI Pre-filled Pen if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique.</p><p>You may leave IMRALDI at room temperature for about 15 to 30 minutes before injecting. Do not remove the cap while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the IMRALDI Pre-filled Pen for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. IMRALDI does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the pen.</p><p>Instruct patients using the IMRALDI Pre-filled Pen to inject the full amount in the pen, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use <span class="Italics">[see Instructions for Use].</span></p><p>Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Pre-filled Pen<br/></span> Injection: 40 mg/0.8 mL of IMRALDI is provided by a single-dose pre-filled pen (IMRALDI Pre-filled Pen), containing a 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe with a fixed 29 gauge and ½ inch needle.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serious Infections</h3><p class="First">Patients treated with adalimumab products are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span>. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.</p><p>The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of IMRALDI and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.11) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><p>Treatment with IMRALDI should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>with chronic or recurrent infection;</li>
<li>who have been exposed to tuberculosis;</li>
<li>with a history of an opportunistic infection;</li>
<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or</li>
<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Tuberculosis</span></p><p>Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating IMRALDI and periodically during therapy.</p><p>Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating IMRALDI, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of ≥ 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette- Guerin (BCG).</p><p>Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of IMRALDI in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti- tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.</p><p>Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during IMRALDI treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Monitoring</span></p><p>Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with IMRALDI, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with IMRALDI.</p><p>Discontinue IMRALDI if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with IMRALDI, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Invasive Fungal Infections</span></p><p>If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.</p><h3>Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Consider the risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including adalimumab products prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF blocker in patients who develop a malignancy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Malignancies in Adults</span></p><p>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult patients compared to control-treated adult patients. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated patients (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated patients and 4 months for control-treated patients). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated patients in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>In controlled trials of other TNF blockers in adult patients at higher risk for malignancies (i.e., patients with COPD with a significant smoking history and cyclophosphamide-treated patients with Wegener's granulomatosis), a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF blocker group compared to the control group.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer</span></p><p>During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated patients. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with adalimumab.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lymphoma and Leukemia</span></p><p>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control-treated patients. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus 1 among 4848 control-treated patients. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 patients and over 40,125 patient- years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient- years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).<span class="Sup">1</span> Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Malignancies in Pediatric Patients and Young Adults</span></p><p>Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), of which adalimumab products are a member <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span>. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post- marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports.</p><p>Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span>. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6–MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine and IMRALDI should be carefully considered.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Anaphylaxis and angioneurotic edema have been reported following administration of adalimumab products. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, immediately discontinue administration of IMRALDI and institute appropriate therapy. In clinical trials of adalimumab products in adults, allergic reactions (e.g., allergic rash, anaphylactoid reaction, fixed drug reaction, non-specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed.</p><h3>Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation</h3><p class="First">Use of TNF blockers, including adalimumab products, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop IMRALDI and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of IMRALDI therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely.</p><h3>Neurologic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of IMRALDI in patients with preexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of IMRALDI should be considered if any of these disorders develop.</p><h3>Hematological Reactions</h3><p class="First">Rare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anemia have been reported with TNF blocking agents. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on IMRALDI. Consider discontinuation of IMRALDI therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities.</p><h3>Use with Anakinra</h3><p class="First">Concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections and neutropenia and no added benefit compared with the TNF-blocker alone in patients with RA. Therefore, the combination of IMRALDI and anakinra is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</span></p><h3>Heart Failure</h3><p class="First">Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers. Cases of worsening CHF have also been observed with adalimumab products. Adalimumab has not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical trials of another TNF blocker, a higher rate of serious CHF-related adverse reactions was observed. Exercise caution when using IMRALDI in patients who have heart failure and monitor them carefully.</p><h3>Autoimmunity</h3><p class="First">Treatment with IMRALDI may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with IMRALDI, discontinue treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Immunizations</h3><p class="First">In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti- pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on IMRALDI may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products.</p><p>It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating IMRALDI therapy. Patients on IMRALDI may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines.</p><p>The safety of administering live or live-attenuated vaccines in infants exposed to adalimumab products <span class="Italics">in utero</span> is unknown. Risks and benefits should be considered prior to vaccinating (live or live- attenuated) exposed infants <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)].</span></p><h3>Use with Abatacept</h3><p class="First">In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of TNF-blockers and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of abatacept with TNF-blockers including adalimumab products is not recommended <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most serious adverse reactions described elsewhere in the labeling include the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Serious Infections <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Malignancies <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo- controlled trials, 20% of patients treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation.</p><p>The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in patients with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA- II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for patients taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Infections</span></p><p>In the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated patients. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post- surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Tuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections</span></p><p>In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated patients, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient- years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Autoantibodies</span></p><p>In the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of patients treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated patients that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two patients out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new- onset lupus-like syndrome. The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy.

In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control- treated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment.</p><p>In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with CD with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Immunogenicity</span></p><p>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.

For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to adalimumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p><p>Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab during the 6- to 12-month period. Approximately 5% (58 of 1062) of adult RA patients receiving adalimumab developed low-titer antibodies to adalimumab at least once during treatment, which were neutralizing <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Patients treated with concomitant methotrexate (MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients on adalimumab monotherapy (1% versus 12%). No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients.

It consists of 1330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons.</p><p>IMRALDI is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free solution of adalimumab for subcutaneous administration. The drug product is supplied as a single-dose, pre-filled pen (IMRALDI Pre-filled Pen). Enclosed within the pre-filled pen is a single-dose, 1 mL pre-filled glass syringe. The solution of IMRALDI is clear and colorless, with a pH of about 5.2.</p><p>Each 40 mg/0.8 mL pre-filled pen delivers 0.8 mL (40 mg) of drug product.

Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> in the presence of complement. Adalimumab does not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased levels of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with adalimumab may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown.</p><p>Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC<span class="Sub">50</span> of 1-2 X 10<span class="Sup">-10</span> M).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C- reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The maximum serum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and the time to reach the maximum concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) were 4.7 ± 1.6 μg/mL and 131 ± 56 hours respectively, following a single 40 mg subcutaneous administration of adalimumab to healthy adult subjects. The average absolute bioavailability of adalimumab estimated from three studies following a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose was 64%. The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10.0 mg/kg following a single intravenous dose.</p><p>The single dose pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in RA patients were determined in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 0.25 to 10 mg/kg. The distribution volume (Vss) ranged from 4.7 to 6.0 L. The systemic clearance of adalimumab is approximately 12 mL/hr. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Adalimumab concentrations in the synovial fluid from five rheumatoid arthritis patients ranged from 31 to 96% of those in serum.</p><p>In RA patients receiving 40 mg adalimumab every other week, adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations of approximately 5 μg/mL and 8 to 9 μg/mL, were observed without and with methotrexate (MTX), respectively. MTX reduced adalimumab apparent clearance after single and multiple dosing by 29% and 44% respectively, in patients with RA. Mean serum adalimumab trough levels at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous dosing. In long- term studies with dosing more than two years, there was no evidence of changes in clearance over time.</p><p>Adalimumab mean steady-state trough concentrations were slightly higher in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with 40 mg adalimumab every other week (6 to 10 μg/mL and 8.5 to 12 μg/mL, without and with MTX, respectively) compared to the concentrations in RA patients treated with the same dose.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in patients with AS were similar to those in patients with RA.</p><p>In patients with CD, the loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 80 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves mean serum adalimumab trough levels of approximately 12 μg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4. Mean steady-state trough levels of approximately 7 μg/mL were observed at Week 24 and Week 56 in CD patients after receiving a maintenance dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week.</p><p>In patients with UC, the loading dose of 160 mg adalimumab on Week 0 followed by 80 mg adalimumab on Week 2 achieves mean serum adalimumab trough levels of approximately 12 μg/mL at Week 2 and Week 4. Mean steady-state trough level of approximately 8 μg/mL was observed at Week 52 in UC patients after receiving a dose of 40 mg adalimumab every other week, and approximately 15 μg/mL at Week 52 in UC patients who increased to a dose of 40 mg adalimumab every week.</p><p>In patients with Ps, the mean steady-state trough concentration was approximately 5 to 6 μg/mL during adalimumab 40 mg every other week monotherapy treatment.</p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with RA revealed that there was a trend toward higher apparent clearance of adalimumab in the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies, and lower clearance with increasing age in patients aged 40 to &gt;75 years.</p><p>Minor increases in apparent clearance were also predicted in RA patients receiving doses lower than the recommended dose and in RA patients with high rheumatoid factor or CRP concentrations. These increases are not likely to be clinically important.</p><p>No gender-related pharmacokinetic differences were observed after correction for a patient's body weight. Healthy volunteers and patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics.</p><p>No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.</p><p>In Study JIA-I for patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years of age, the mean steady-state trough serum adalimumab concentrations for patients weighing &lt;30 kg receiving 20 mg adalimumab subcutaneously every other week as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX were 6.8 μg/mL and 10.9 μg/mL, respectively.

In the study, the patients were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non- MTX-treated. All patients had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Patients who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study.</p><p>The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to 136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the patients were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (≤0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum).</p><p>Patients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare.

Upon completion of both studies, 383 patients enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week.</p><p>Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult patients with moderately to severely active PsA (&gt;3 swollen and &gt;3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms: (1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Patients on MTX therapy (158 of 313 patients) at enrollment (stable dose of ≤30 mg/week for &gt;1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study.</p><p>Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see Tables 7 and 8). Among patients with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in patients with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few patients were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.</p><p>Patients with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of patients achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p&lt;0.001).
