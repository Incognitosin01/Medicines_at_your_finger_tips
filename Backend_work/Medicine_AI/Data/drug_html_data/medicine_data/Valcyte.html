This medicine is also used to treat CMV infection of the eye in adults with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>Valcyte is used in children at least 4 months old to prevent CMV infection after a kidney transplant. This medicine is also used in children at least 1 month old to prevent CMV disease after a heart transplant.</p><p>Valcyte will not cure CMV but it can help control the infection. This medicine is not for treating CMV that a baby is born with.</p><p>Valcyte may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use if you are pregnant.</b> Valcyte can cause birth defects.
