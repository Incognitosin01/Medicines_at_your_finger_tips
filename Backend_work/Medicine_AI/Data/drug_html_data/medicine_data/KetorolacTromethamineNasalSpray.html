</ul><h2>Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Instructions</h3><p class="First">Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5)</span>].</p><p>The total duration of use of Ketorolac Tromethamine alone or sequentially with other formulations of ketorolac (IM/IV or oral) must not exceed 5 days because of the potential for increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions associated with the recommended doses [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)</span>].</p><p>Do not use Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray concomitantly with other formulations of ketorolac or other NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)</span>].</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First">Ketorolac Tromethamine is not an inhaled product. Do not inhale when administering this product.</p><p>Instruct patients to administer as follows:</p><p>1. First hold the finger flange with fingers, and remove the clear plastic cover with opposite hand; then remove the blue plastic safety clip. Keep the clear plastic cover; and throw away the blue plastic safety clip.</p><p>2. Before using the bottle for the <span class="Bold">FIRST</span> time, activate the pump. To activate the pump, hold the bottle at arm’s length away from the body with index finger and middle finger resting on the top of the finger flange and thumb supporting the base.</p><p><span class="Bold">Press down evenly and release the pump 5 times.</span> Patient may not see a spray the first few times he/she presses down.</p><p>The bottle is now ready to use. There is no need to activate the pump again if more doses are used from the bottle.</p><p>3. It’s important to get the medication to the correct place in the nose so it will be most effective.</p><p>    - Blow nose gently to clear nostrils.<br/>
    - Sit up straight or stand.  Tilt head slightly forward.<br/>
    - Insert the tip of the container into your right nostril.  <br/>
    - Point the container away from the center of your nose. <br/>
    - Hold your breath and spray once into your right nostril, pressing down evenly on both sides.<br/>
    - Immediately after administration, resume breathing through mouth to reduce expelling the product.  Also pinch the nose to help retain the spray if it starts to drip.</p><p>    If only one spray per dose is prescribed, administration is complete; skip to Step 5 below.</p><p>4. If a dose of 2 sprays is prescribed, repeat the process in Step 3 for the left nostril. Again, be sure to point the spray away from the center of nose. Spray once into the left nostril.</p><p>5. Replace the clear plastic cover and place the bottle in a cool, dry location out of direct sunlight, such as inside a medication cabinet. Keep out of reach of children.</p><h3>Adult Patients &lt; 65 Years of Age</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose is 31.5 mg Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray (one 15.75 mg spray in each nostril) every 6 to 8 hours. The maximum daily dose is 126 mg (four doses).</p><h3>Reduced Doses for Special Populations</h3><p class="First">For patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired patients, and adult patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs), the recommended dose is 15.75 mg Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray (<span class="Bold">one</span> 15.75 mg spray in <span class="Bold">only one</span> nostril) every 6 to 8 hours. The maximum daily dose is 63 mg (four doses) [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)</span>].</p><h3>Discard Used Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray bottle after 24 Hours</h3><p class="First">Do not use any single Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray bottle for more than one day as it will not deliver the intended dose after 24 hours. Therefore, the bottle must be discarded no more than 24 hours after taking the first dose, even if the bottle still contains some liquid.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray: 15.75 mg of ketorolac tromethamine in each 100 μL spray. Each 1.7 g bottle contains 8 sprays.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray is contraindicated in the following patients:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions) to ketorolac or any components of the drug product [<span class="Italics">see Warning and Precautions (5.7, 5.9)</span>]</li>
<li>History of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, sometimes fatal, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)</span>]</li>
<li>In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>
<li>Use in patients with active peptic ulcer disease and in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]</li>
<li>Use as a prophylactic analgesic before any major surgery [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</span>]</li>
<li>Use in patients with advanced renal disease or patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>]</li>
<li>Use in labor and delivery. Through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory effect, ketorolac may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>]</li>
<li>Use in patients with suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis, or those for whom hemostasis is critical [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.11), Drug Interactions (7)</span>]</li>
<li>Concomitant use with probenecid [see Drug Interactions (7)]</li>
<li>Concomitant use with pentoxifylline [see Drug Interactions (7)]</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</p><p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</p><p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ketorolac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery</span></p><p>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-MI Patients</span></p><p>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</p><p>Avoid the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Ketorolac Tromethamine is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</h3><p class="First">Ketorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding and in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p>NSAIDs, including ketorolac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</span></p><p>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</p><p><span class="Bold">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:</span></p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.</li>
<li>Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.</li>
<li>Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Do not use Ketorolac Tromethamine in those with active GI bleeding.</li>
<li>Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.</li>
<li>If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue Ketorolac Tromethamine until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.</li>
<li>In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</li>
<li>Use great care when giving Ketorolac Tromethamine to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.</li>
</ul><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.</p><p>Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including ketorolac.</p><p>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue Ketorolac Tromethamine immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.</p><h3>Heart Failure and Edema</h3><p class="First">The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.</p><p>Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of ketorolac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>Avoid the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Ketorolac Tromethamine is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia</h3><p class="First">Ketorolac and its metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. Patients with reduced creatinine clearance will have diminished clearance of the drug [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Ketorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Toxicity</span></p><p>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</p><p>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of Ketorolac Tromethamine may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.</p><p>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of Ketorolac Tromethamine [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Avoid the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hyperkalemia</span></p><p>Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.</p><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Ketorolac has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to ketorolac and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</p><p>Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity</h3><p class="First">A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Ketorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>]. When Ketorolac Tromethamine is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">NSAIDs, including ketorolac, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of Ketorolac Tromethamine at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Ketorolac Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4)</span>].</p><h3>Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus</h3><p class="First">Ketorolac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester) [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with Ketorolac Tromethamine has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. Do not use Ketorolac Tromethamine in patients for whom hemostasis is critical [<span class="Italics">see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>The concurrent use of ketorolac and therapy that affects hemostasis, including prophylactic low dose heparin (2500 to 5000 units q12h), warfarin and dextrans, has not been studied extensively, but may also be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Until data from such studies are available, carefully weigh the benefits against the risks and use such concomitant therapy in these patients only with extreme caution. Monitor patients receiving therapy that affects hemostasis closely.</p><p>In clinical trials, serious adverse events related to bleeding were more common in patients treated with Ketorolac Tromethamine than placebo. In clinical trials and in postmarketing experience with ketorolac IV and IM dosing, postoperative hematomas and other signs of wound bleeding have been reported in association with peri-operative use. Therefore, use Ketorolac Tromethamine with caution in the postoperative setting when hemostasis is critical.</p><h3>Masking of Inflammation and Fever</h3><p class="First">The pharmacological activity of Ketorolac Tromethamine in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring</h3><p class="First">Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)</span>].</p><h3>Eye Exposure</h3><p class="First">Avoid contact of Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray with the eyes. If eye contact occurs, wash out the eye with water or saline, and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour.</p><h3>Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">The total duration of use of Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray alone or sequentially with other forms of ketorolac is not to exceed 5 days. Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray must not be used concomitantly with other forms of ketorolac or other NSAIDs [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.1)</span>].</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to Ketorolac Tromethamine in patients enrolled in placebo-controlled efficacy studies of acute pain following major surgery. The studies enrolled 828 patients (183 men, 645 women) ranging from 18 years to over 75 years of age.</p><p>The patients in the postoperative pain studies had undergone major abdominal, orthopedic, gynecologic, or other surgery; 455 patients received Ketorolac Tromethamine (31.5 mg) three or four times a day for up to 5 days, and 245 patients received placebo. Most patients were receiving concomitant opioids, primarily PCA morphine.</p><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to local symptoms, i.e., nasal discomfort or irritation. These reactions were generally mild and transient in nature.</p><p>The most common drug-related adverse events leading to premature discontinuation were nasal discomfort or nasal pain (rhinalgia).<br/></p><p>In controlled clinical trials in major surgery, primarily knee and hip replacements and abdominal hysterectomies, seven patients (N=455, 1.5%) treated with Ketorolac Tromethamine experienced serious adverse events of bleeding (4 patients) or hematoma (3 patients) at the operative site versus one patient (N=245, 0.4%) treated with placebo (hematoma). Six of the seven patients treated with Ketorolac Tromethamine underwent a surgical procedure and/or blood transfusion and the placebo patient subsequently required a blood transfusion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials with Other Dosage Forms of Ketorolac or Other NSAIDs</span></p><p>Adverse reaction rates increase with higher doses of ketorolac. It is necessary to remain alert for the severe complications of treatment with ketorolac, such as GI ulceration, bleeding, and perforation, postoperative bleeding, acute renal failure, anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, and liver failure. These complications can be serious in certain patients for whom ketorolac is indicated, especially when the drug is used inappropriately.</p><p>In patients taking ketorolac or other NSAIDs in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients are:<br/>
<br/>
Gastrointestinal (GI) experiences including:<br/></p><p>*<span class="Italics">Incidence greater than 10%</span><br/>

<li>Ketorolac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of ketorolac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</li>
<li>Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.</li>
<li>When ketorolac is administered concurrently with pentoxifylline, there is an increased risk of bleeding.</li>
</ul><p class="First">Concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</span>].<br/>

</ul><p class="First">NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.</p><p>In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C prior to 30 weeks gestation; Category D starting at 30 weeks gestation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Use of NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation (third trimester).</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Ketorolac Tromethamine in pregnant women. Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U.S. population, all clinically recognized pregnancies, regardless of drug exposure, have a background rate of 2-4% for major malformations, and 15-20% for pregnancy loss. In animal reproduction studies in rabbits and rats tested at 0.6 and 1.5 times the human systemic exposure, respectively, at the recommended maximum IN dose of 31.5 mg four times a day, there was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as ketorolac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>There are no studies on the effects of Ketorolac Tromethamine during labor or delivery.

These studies did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse developmental outcomes. However, because animal dosing was limited by maternal toxicity, these studies do not adequately assess ketorolac’s potential to cause adverse developmental outcomes in humans.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Ketorolac is excreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Ketorolac Tromethamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the Ketorolac Tromethamine or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Exercise caution when administering Ketorolac Tromethamine to a nursing woman. Available information has not shown any specific adverse events in nursing infants; however, instruct patients to contact their infant’s health care provider if they note any adverse events.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Limited data from one published study involving ten nursing mothers 2-6 days postpartum showed low levels of ketorolac in breast milk. Levels were undetectable (less than 5 ng/mL) in 4 of the patients. After a single administration of 10 mg ketorolac, the maximum milk concentration observed was 7.3 ng/mL, and the maximum milk to plasma ratio was 0.037. After 1 day of dosing (10 mg every 6 hours), the maximum milk concentration was 7.9 ng/mL, and the maximum milk-to-plasma ratio was 0.025. Assuming a daily intake of 400-1000 mL of human milk per day and a maternal body weight of 60 kg, the calculated maximum daily infant exposure was 0.00263 mg/kg/day, which is 0.4% of the maternal weight adjusted dose.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including Ketorolac Tromethamine, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Ketorolac Tromethamine is not for use in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of ketorolac in pediatric patients 17 years of age and younger have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Exercise caution when treating the elderly (65 years and older) with Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray. Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. After observing the response to initial therapy with Ketorolac Tromethamine, adjust the dose and frequency to suit an individual patient’s needs.</p><p>Ketorolac and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, use caution in this patient population, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)</span>].</p><p>There has been no experience with overdosage of Ketorolac Tromethamine. In controlled overdosage studies with IM ketorolac injection, daily doses of 360 mg given for five days (approximately 3 times the maximum daily dose of Ketorolac Tromethamine) caused abdominal pain and peptic ulcers, which healed after discontinuation of dosing. Single overdoses of ketorolac tromethamine have been variously associated with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hyperventilation, peptic ulcers and/or erosive gastritis, and renal dysfunction.</p><p>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</p><p>For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray Description</h2><p class="First">Ketorolac Tromethamine Nasal Spray is a member of the pyrrolo-pyrrole group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, available as a clear, colorless to yellow solution packaged in a glass vial with a snap on spray pump that delivers 15.75 mg ketorolac tromethamine per spray and is intended for intranasal administration.

Ketorolac concentrations reached during therapy have produced <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because ketorolac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The half-lives of ketorolac by the IN and IM routes were similar. The bioavailability of ketorolac by the IN route of administration of a 31.5 mg dose was approximately 60% compared to IM administration. (See Table 3).</p><p>C<span class="Sub">max</span> = maximum plasma concentration; t<span class="Sub">max</span> = time of C<span class="Sub">max</span>; AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> = complete area under the concentration-time curve; T<span class="Sub">½</span> = half-life; SD = standard deviation. All values are means, except t<span class="Sub">max</span>, for which medians are reported.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></span></p><p>In a study in which Ketorolac Tromethamine (31.5 mg) was administered to healthy volunteers four times daily for 5 days, the C<span class="Sub">max</span>, t<span class="Sub">max</span>, and AUC values following the final dose were comparable to those obtained in the single-dose study. Accumulation of ketorolac has not been studied in special populations, geriatric, pediatric, renal failure or hepatic disease patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Scintigraphic assessment of drug disposition of ketorolac following Ketorolac Tromethamine intranasal dosing demonstrated that most of the ketorolac was deposited in the nasal cavity and pharynx, with less than 20% deposited in the esophagus and stomach, and zero or negligible deposition in the lungs (&lt;0.5%).</p><p>The mean apparent volume (Vβ) of ketorolac tromethamine following complete distribution was approximately 13 liters. This parameter was determined from single-dose data. The ketorolac tromethamine racemate has been shown to be highly protein bound (99.2%). Nevertheless, plasma concentrations as high as 10 mcg/mL will only occupy approximately 5% of the albumin binding sites. Thus, the unbound fraction for each enantiomer will be constant over the therapeutic range. A decrease in serum albumin, however, will result in increased free drug concentrations. Therapeutic concentrations of digoxin, warfarin, ibuprofen, naproxen, piroxicam, acetaminophen, phenytoin, and tolbutamide did not alter ketorolac protein binding. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that, at therapeutic concentrations of salicylate (300 mcg/mL), the binding of ketorolac was reduced from approximately 99.2% to 97.5%, representing a potential twofold increase in unbound ketorolac plasma levels.</p><p>The <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> binding of warfarin to plasma proteins is only slightly reduced by ketorolac (99.5% control vs. 99.3%) when ketorolac plasma concentrations reach 5 to 10 mcg/mL.</p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is excreted in human milk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Ketorolac tromethamine is largely metabolized in the liver. The metabolic products are hydroxylated and conjugated forms of the parent drug. The products of metabolism, and some unchanged drug, are excreted in the urine. There is no evidence in animal or human studies that ketorolac induces or inhibits hepatic enzymes capable of metabolizing itself or other drugs.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>The principal route of elimination of ketorolac and its metabolites is renal. About 92% of a given dose is found in the urine, approximately 40% as metabolites and 60% as unchanged ketorolac. Approximately 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces. A single-dose study with 10 mg ketorolac tromethamine (n = 9) demonstrated that the S-enantiomer is cleared approximately two times faster than the R-enantiomer and that the clearance was independent of the route of administration. This means that the ratio of S/R plasma concentrations decreases with time after each dose. There is little or no inversion of the R- to S- form in humans.</p><p>The half-life of the ketorolac tromethamine S-enantiomer was approximately 2.5 hours (SD ± 0.4) compared with 5 hours (SD ± 1.7) for the R-enantiomer. In other studies, the half-life for the racemate has been reported to lie within the range of 5 to 6 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric:</span> A single-dose study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetics of Ketorolac Tromethamine (31.5 mg) in subjects ≥ age 65 to the pharmacokinetics in subjects &lt; age 65. Exposure to ketorolac was increased by 23% for the ≥ 65 population as compared to subjects &lt; 65. Peak concentrations of 2028 and 1840 ng/mL were observed for the elderly and nonelderly adult populations, respectively, at 0.75 h after dosing. In the elderly population a longer terminal half-life was observed as compared to the nonelderly adults (4.5 h vs. 3.3 h, respectively).</p><p><span class="Italics">Race:</span> Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment:</span> There was no significant difference in estimates of half-life, AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> in 7 patients with liver disease compared to healthy volunteers.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment:</span> Based on single-dose data only, the mean half-life of ketorolac tromethamine in renally impaired patients is between 6 and 19 hours, and is dependent on the extent of the impairment. There is poor correlation between creatinine clearance and total ketorolac tromethamine clearance in the elderly and populations with renal impairment (r = 0.5).</p><p>In patients with renal disease, the AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span> of each enantiomer increased by approximately 100% compared with healthy volunteers. The volume of distribution doubles for the S-enantiomer and increases by 1/5th for the R-enantiomer. The increase in volume of distribution of ketorolac tromethamine implies an increase in unbound fraction. The AUC<span class="Sub">∞</span>-ratio of the ketorolac tromethamine enantiomers in healthy subjects and patients remained similar, indicating there was no selective excretion of either enantiomer in patients compared to healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Allergic Rhinitis:</span> Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of Ketorolac Tromethamine in subjects with allergic rhinitis to data from a previous study in healthy subjects showed no differences that would be of clinical consequence for the efficacy or safety of Ketorolac Tromethamine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Aspirin:</span> When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered.
