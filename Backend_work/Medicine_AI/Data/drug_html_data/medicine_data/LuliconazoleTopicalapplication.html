</ul><p>Luliconazole is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using luliconazole</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For luliconazole, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to luliconazole or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of luliconazole topical cream in <i>children younger than 12 years of age to treat tinea pedis and tinea cruris</i> and in <i>children younger than 2 years of age to treat tinea corporis</i>. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of luliconazole topical cream in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of luliconazole than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of luliconazole</h2><p><i>It is very important that you use luliconazole only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects or skin irritation.</p><p>Luliconazole should come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Luliconazole is for use <i>on the skin</i> only. Do not get it into your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina.</p><p>Wash your hands before and after using luliconazole.</p><p>Apply enough medicine to cover the affected and surrounding skin areas, and rub in gently.</p><p>To help clear up your infection completely, it is very important that you <i>keep using luliconazole for the full time of treatment</i>, even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days. Since fungus or yeast infections may be very slow to clear up, you may have to continue using luliconazole every day for several weeks or more. If you stop using luliconazole too soon, your symptoms may return. Do not miss any doses.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of luliconazole will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of luliconazole. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
