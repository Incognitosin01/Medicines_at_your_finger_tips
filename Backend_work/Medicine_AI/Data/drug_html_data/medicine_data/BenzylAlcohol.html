To survive, lice breathe through sophisticated spiracles that close upon contact with most liquids, allowing the lice to go into suspended animation and survive for hours without respiration. Benzyl alcohol prevents lice from closing their spiracles, thereby asphyxiating them within ten minutes and causing death.</p><h2>Benzyl Alcohol Lotion 5% Patient Information</h2><p>Read the Patient Information that comes with Benzyl Alcohol Lotion 5% before you start using it and each time you get a refill.
