Bile acids are produced naturally in the body to aid in digestion of fats and certain nutrients.</p><p>People with bile acid disorders are unable to produce Cholbam normally. This can make it harder for the body to absorb nutrients important for health, growth, and body functioning. Abnormal bile acids can also build up in the body and become toxic to the liver.</p><p>Cholbam is used in people with bile acid disorders.  Cholbam works by normalizing bile acid production in the body.</p><p>Cholbam may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
