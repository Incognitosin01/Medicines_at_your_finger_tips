Some carbohydrate and electrolytes solutions may also be used after surgery when food intake has been stopped.</p><p>This medicine is available without a prescription; however, your doctor may have special instructions on the proper use and dose for you or your child.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using CeraLyte 70</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines.
