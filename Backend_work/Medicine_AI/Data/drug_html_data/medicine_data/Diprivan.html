Also make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. In some cases, you may not be able to use Diprivan.</p><h2>Before receiving this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive Diprivan if you are allergic to propofol.</p><p>To make sure Diprivan is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>

These effects may be more likely when the anesthesia is used for 3 hours or longer, or used for repeated procedures. Effects on brain development could cause learning or behavior problems later in life.</p><p>Negative brain effects from anesthesia have been seen in animal studies. However, studies in human children receiving single short uses of anesthesia have not shown a likely effect on behavior or learning. More research is needed.</p><p>In some cases, your doctor may decide to postpone a surgery or procedure based on these risks. Treatment may not be delayed in the case of life-threatening conditions, medical emergencies, or surgery needed to correct certain birth defects.</p><p>Ask your doctor for information about all medicines that will be used during your surgery or procedure. Also ask how long the procedure will last.</p><p>Propofol can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while using this medicine.</p><h2>How is Diprivan given?</h2><p>Diprivan is injected into a vein through an IV.
