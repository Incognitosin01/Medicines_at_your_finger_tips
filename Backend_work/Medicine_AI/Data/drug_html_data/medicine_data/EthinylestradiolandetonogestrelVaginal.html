It is a flexible birth control vaginal ring that contains two types of hormones, etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than vaginal rings. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.</p><p>Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel will not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.</p><p>Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol combination have not been performed in the pediatric population. However, pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel in teenagers are not expected. Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel may be used for birth control in teenage females but should not be used before the start of menstruation.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol combination have not been performed in the geriatric population. Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel is not indicated for use in elderly women.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel</h2><p>It is very important that you <i>use ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects.</p><p>Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel is to be used <i>only in the vagina</i>. This combination medicine is contained in a ring that is placed into your vagina. The ring will slowly release small amounts of the medicine for your body to absorb.</p><p>Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.</p><p>NuvaRingÂ® is used in a 4 week cycle. You may start using the vaginal ring on the first day of your menstrual period or between the second and fifth day, keeping it in place for 3 weeks.</p><p>Once the ring is in place inside your vagina, you should not be able to feel it. If you feel uncomfortable, the ring may not be inserted far enough. Gently push the ring farther into your vagina. If you feel pain, talk to your doctor.</p><p>Check for the presence of the ring inside your vagina regularly (including before and after having sex).</p><p>The ring may move down into the lower part of your vagina accidently. This can happen if you strain to have a bowel movement. Use your finger to gently push the ring back into place. If the ring comes all the way out of your vagina, rinse it off with warm water and put it back in. Call your doctor if the ring comes out several times.</p><p>Remove the vaginal ring after 3 weeks on the same day of the week and time it was inserted. During the 1-week break, you will usually have your menstrual period. Another ring will be inserted after a week.</p><p>While using ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel, you may need to use an additional form of birth control method (eg, condom, spermicide) during the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy. Do not use a vaginal diaphragm because the ring may affect how the diaphragm fits.</p><p>If you need to remove the ring, hook your finger through it and pull it out.</p><p><i>If you are switching from a combination hormonal method (eg, pills, patch) to NuvaRingÂ®</i>, start using ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel on any day. Do not start using ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel any later than the day you would start your next birth control pill or patch.</p><p><i>If you are switching from a progestin-only method (eg, progestin-only pill, implant, injection, intrauterine system) to NuvaRingÂ®</i>, start using it on the day after you used your last progestin-only pill, or on the day your implant or IUD is removed, or on the day you would have your next injection. You must also use an additional barrier method of birth control (eg, male condom with spermicide) for the first 7 days.</p><p>Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may change the amount of ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel that is absorbed in the body.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
<li>For vaginal dosage form (ring):
<ul>
<li>For contraception (to prevent pregnancy):
<ul>
<li>Adultsâ€”One ring inserted into the vagina for 3 weeks, followed by a 1 week ring-free interval. Then, a new ring is inserted 1 week after the last ring was removed.</li>

</ul><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions.</p><p>If NuvaRingÂ® has slipped out of the vagina and it has been out <i>less than 3 hours</i>, you should still be protected from pregnancy. If NuvaRingÂ® has been out of the vagina for <i>more than 3 hours</i>, you may not be adequately protected from pregnancy, and must use an extra method of birth control until NuvaRingÂ® has been in place for 7 days in a row.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.</p><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><p>Store ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel for up to 4 months after you receive it.</p><p>Place the used NuvaRingÂ® in the re-sealable foil pouch and throw it in the trash where children and pets cannot get to it.

If you smoke while using NuvaRingÂ®, you increase your risk of having a blood clot, heart attack, or stroke. Your risk is even higher if you are over age 35, if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or if you are overweight. Talk with your doctor about ways to stop smoking. Keep your diabetes under control. Ask your doctor about diet and exercise to control your weight and blood cholesterol level.</p><p>Using ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel may increase your risk of having blood clotting problems.
