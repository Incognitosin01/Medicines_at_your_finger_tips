It is also used to treat liver infection caused by protozoa (extraintestinal amebiasis). Chloroquine may also be used to treat coronavirus (COVID-19) in certain hospitalized patients.</p><p>Using chloroquine alone or with other medicines (eg, azithromycin) may increase your risk of heart rhythm problems (eg, QT prolongation, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia). <i>Chloroquine should only be used for COVID-19 in a hospital or during clinical trials.</i> Do not take any medicine that contains chloroquine unless prescribed by your doctor.</p><p>Chloroquine belongs to a group of medicines known as antimalarials. It works by preventing or treating malaria, a red blood cell infection transmitted by the bite of a mosquito. However, chloroquine is not used to treat severe or complicated malaria and to prevent malaria in areas or regions where chloroquine is known not to work (resistance).</p><p>Chloroquine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using chloroquine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For chloroquine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to chloroquine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of chloroquine to prevent and treat malaria in children. However, children are more sensitive to the effects of chloroquine than adults. Safety and efficacy of chloroquine to treat extraintestinal amebiasis have not been established in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of chloroquine have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of chloroquine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving chloroquine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking chloroquine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using chloroquine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of chloroquine</h2><p><i>Take chloroquine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of serious side effects.</p><p>For patients taking chloroquine <i>to prevent malaria</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Your doctor will want you to start taking chloroquine 1 to 2 weeks before you travel to an area where there is a chance of getting malaria. This will help you to see how you react to the medicine. Also, it will allow time for your doctor to change to another medicine if you have a reaction to chloroquine.</li>
<li>Also, you should keep taking chloroquine while you are in the area and for 4 weeks after you leave the area. No medicine will protect you completely from malaria. However, to protect you as completely as possible, it is important to keep taking chloroquine for the full time your doctor ordered. Also, if fever develops during your travels or within 2 months after you leave the area, check with your doctor immediately.</li>
</ul><p>If you are taking chloroquine to help keep you from getting malaria, <i>keep taking it for the full time of treatment</i>. If you already have malaria, you should still keep taking chloroquine for the full time of treatment even if you begin to feel better after a few days. This will help clear up your infection completely. If you stop taking chloroquine too soon, your symptoms may return.</p><p>Chloroquine works best when you take it on a regular schedule. For example, if you are taking it once a week to prevent malaria, <i>it is best to take it on the same day of each week</i>. Make sure that you do not miss any doses. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor.</p><p>If you are also taking kaolin or antacids, <i>take them at least 4 hours before or after using chloroquine</i>. If you are also taking ampicillin, <i>take it at least 2 hours before or after using chloroquine</i>.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of chloroquine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of chloroquine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

This is to make sure that the infection is cleared up completely, and to allow your doctor to check for any unwanted effects. Your doctor may check your blood, urine, eyes, ears, and knee or ankle reflexes during or after using chloroquine.</p><p>If your symptoms do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>Chloroquine may cause heart problems and changes in your heart rhythm. Check with your doctor right away if you have chest pain or tightness, decreased urine output, dilated neck veins, extreme fatigue, swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, troubled breathing, or weight gain. You may also feel dizzy or faint, or you may have a fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat.</p><p>Chloroquine may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which may be life-threatening. <i>Low blood sugar must be treated before it causes you to pass out (unconsciousness). People feel different symptoms of low blood sugar</i>. It is important that you learn which symptoms you usually have so you can treat it quickly. Talk to your doctor about the best way to treat low blood sugar.</p><p>Chloroquine may cause vision problems. It may also make you dizzy or lightheaded. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how chloroquine affects you.</i> . If these reactions are especially bothersome, check with your doctor.</p><p>Check with your doctor immediately if blurred vision, difficulty with reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after treatment. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).</p><p>Chloroquine may cause extrapyramidal disorders (eg, dystonia, dyskinesia, tongue protrusion, torticollis). Check with your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms after using the medicine: difficulty in speaking, drooling, loss of balance control, muscle trembling, jerking, or stiffness, restlessness, shuffling walk, stiffness of the limbs, twisting movements of the body, or uncontrolled movements, especially of the face, neck, and back.</p><p>Using chloroquine for a long time may cause muscle weakness. Check with your doctor right away if you have muscle weakness while using chloroquine.</p><p>Children are very sensitive to chloroquine, and accidental overdoses have occurred with small amounts of chloroquine. Keep chloroquine out of the reach of children.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have continuing ringing or buzzing or other unexplained noise in the ears or hearing loss while using chloroquine.</p><p>While you are being treated with chloroquine, do not have any immunizations (eg, rabies vaccine) without your doctor's approval.</p><p>Malaria is spread by the bites of certain kinds of infected female mosquitoes. If you are living in or will be traveling to an area where there is a chance of getting malaria, the following mosquito-control measures will help to prevent infection:</p><ul>
<li>If possible, avoid going out between dusk and dawn because it is at these times that mosquitoes most commonly bite.</li>
<li>Remain in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms to reduce contact with mosquitoes.</li>
<li>Wear long-sleeved shirts or blouses and long trousers to protect your arms and legs, especially from dusk through dawn when mosquitoes are out.</li>
<li>Apply insect repellent, preferably one containing DEET, to uncovered areas of the skin from dusk through dawn when mosquitoes are out.</li>
<li>If possible, sleep in a screened or air-conditioned room or under mosquito netting, preferably coated or soaked with pyrethrum, to avoid being bitten by malaria-carrying mosquitoes.</li>
<li>Use mosquito coils or sprays to kill mosquitoes in living and sleeping quarters during evening and nighttime hours.</li>
</ul><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Chloroquine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
