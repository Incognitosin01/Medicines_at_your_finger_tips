The extent is dependent on several factors, including epidermal integrity (intact vs abraded skin), formulation, and the use of occlusive dressings</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hepatic</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine, bile</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Dermatologic disorders:</b> Acute and chronic dermatologic disorders including contact or atopic dermatitis; impetiginized eczema; nummular eczema; infantile eczema; endogenous chronic infectious dermatitis; stasis dermatitis; pyoderma; nuchal eczema and chronic eczematoid otitis externa; acne urticata; localized or disseminated neurodermatitis; lichen simplex chronicus; anogenital pruritus (vulvae, scroti, ani); folliculitis; bacterial dermatoses; mycotic dermatoses such as tinea (capitis, cruris, corporis, pedis); moniliasis; intertrigo.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to iodochlorhydroxyquin, hydrocortisone, chloroxine, iodine, iodine-containing preparations, or related compounds; eye lesions; tuberculosis of the skin; herpes simplex, vaccinia, eczema vaccinia, varicella, or other viral infections of the skin.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Syphilitic skin infections; application to large areas, ulcerated areas, or to the eye; children &lt;2 years.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Dermatologic disorders:</b> Topical: Apply a thin film 2 to 4 times daily.</p><p>Vioform Hydrocortisone [Canadian product]: Apply a thin film 2 to 3 times daily.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Adjust dose depending upon condition being treated and response of patient. The lowest possible dose should be used to control the condition; when dose reduction is possible, the dose should be reduced gradually.</p><p><b>Dermatologic disorders:</b></p><p>Children ≥2 years and Adolescents: Clioquinol 3%/hydrocortisone 0.5% cream: Topical: Apply a thin film to affected area 2 to 4 times daily.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling: </i>Vioform Hydrocortisone (clioquinol 3%/hydrocortisone 1%) cream: Topical: Children ≥2 years and Adolescents: Apply a thin film 2 to 3 times daily.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Topical: For external use only; avoid contact with eyes. Apply a thin film to clean, dry skin and rub in gently. Can stain skin and fabric. Use of occlusive dressings is not recommended.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); protect from freezing.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. <i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Calcipotriene: Hydrocortisone (Topical) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Calcipotriene.  Management: Monitor for reduced calcipotriene efficacy if combined with hydrocortisone valerate. Consider separating the administration of these agents by 10 to 12 hours to minimize the risk of this potential interaction.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Test Interactions</h2><p>Thyroid function tests; false-positive ferric chloride test for phenylketonuria.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified. Reported with combination product; frequency not defined.</p><p>Dermatologic: Allergic skin reaction, dyschromia, epidermal thinning, hair discoloration, skin rash</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Nonthrombocytopenic purpura</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.</p><p>• Sensitization: Topical use has been associated with irritation (rare); discontinue use if irritation occurs.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms requiring appropriate therapy.</p><p>• Staining: May stain skin and fabrics; may discolor (yellowing) hair and fingernails (rare).</p><p>• Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, and/or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, or application to large surface areas.</p><p><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.</p><p>• Thyroid disease: Use caution in patients with thyroid disease.</p><p><b>Special populations:</b></p><p>• Pediatric: Topical application poses a potential risk of toxicity to infants and children; striae has been reported with use of some corticosteroids in infants and children. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of corticosteroids after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></p><p>• Appropriate response: Re-evaluate patient if no response within 1 to 2 weeks.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Avoid use on large or eroded areas, use for &gt;1 week, and use of occlusive dressings.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Observe affected area for increased irritation; growth in children.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
