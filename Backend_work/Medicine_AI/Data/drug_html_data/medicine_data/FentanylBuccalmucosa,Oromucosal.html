Due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression, fentanyl sublingual spray is contraindicated in opioid non-tolerant patients and in management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraines.Accidental ingestion of fentanyl sublingual spray, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. Keep out of reach of children. Ensure proper storage and disposal.Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl.Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.When prescribing, do not convert patients on a mcg per mcg basis from any other oral transmucosal fentanyl product to fentanyl sublingual spray.When dispensing, do not substitute with any other fentanyl products.Fentanyl sublingual spray exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient’s risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions.Fentanyl sublingual spray is available only through a restricted program called the TIRF REMS Access program. Outpatients, healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients, pharmacies, and distributors are required to enroll in the program.Prolonged use of fentanyl sublingual spray during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available..</p><p>Due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression, transmucosal fentanyl citrate is contraindicated in opioid non-tolerant patients and in management of acute or postoperative pain, including headache/migraines.

It is used for breakthrough cancer pain, which are flares of pain that “break through” after a routine pain medicine has been used. Fentanyl belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics. <i>It is only used in patients who are already taking narcotic analgesics</i>.</p><p>Fentanyl acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of its side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS. When a narcotic is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming or cause mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuous pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. Withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before the medicine is stopped completely. Talk to your doctor about the benefits of fentanyl and how to prevent withdrawal side effects.</p><p>Fentanyl is available only with your doctor's prescription. The <i>Abstral®, Actiq®, Fentora®, Onsolis®, and Subsys®</i> products are only available under a restricted distribution program. You will have to read and sign papers that explain how the medicine is used when you pick up your prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using fentanyl</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fentanyl, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fentanyl or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fentanyl in children younger than 18 years of age for the <i>Abstral®, Fentora®, Onsolis®, and Subsys®</i> brands, and in children younger than 16 years of age for the <i>Actiq®</i> brand. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fentanyl in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of narcotic analgesics than younger adults and are more likely to have age-related lung or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fentanyl in order to avoid serious side effects.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking fentanyl, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using fentanyl with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
<li>Mifepristone</li>
<li>Nalmefene</li>
<li>Naltrexone</li>
<li>Safinamide</li>
</ul><p>Using fentanyl with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it.</p><p><i>Do not use fentanyl for minor aches and pains (eg, headaches, migraines) or after surgery or injuries</i>.</p><p>Do not use fentanyl if you have taken a monoamine oxidase (MAOI) inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid phenelzine, selegiline, tranylcypromine, Eldepryl®, Marplan®, Nardil®, or Parnate®) in the past 2 weeks.</p><p>Using fentanyl while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using fentanyl.</p><p><i>Fentanyl is a medicine that can harm or cause death to a child</i>. Patients and caregivers should keep fentanyl out of the reach of children. Carefully dispose of any partially used units or unused medicine properly.</p><p>Fentanyl may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions.</p><p>Fentanyl will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using fentanyl. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, benzodiazepines, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, barbiturates or seizure medicines, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of the medicines listed above while you are using fentanyl</i>.</p><p>Fentanyl may cause some people to become drowsy, confused, or dizzy. <i>Make sure you know how you react to fentanyl before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert</i>. Check with your doctor if you have confusion or drowsiness that is severe enough to interfere with your daily activities.</p><p>Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may tell you to take laxatives, drink fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Follow the directions carefully. Constipation that continues can lead to more serious problems.</p><p>If you have been using fentanyl regularly for several weeks or more, <i>do not suddenly stop using it without checking with your doctor</i>. You may be directed to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely to lessen the chance of withdrawal side effects.</p><p>Using too much fentanyl, or taking too much of another narcotic with fentanyl, may cause an overdose. If this occurs, get emergency help right away. An overdose can cause severe breathing problems (breathing may even stop), unconsciousness, and death. <i>Serious signs of an overdose include</i> very slow breathing (fewer than 8 breaths each minute) and drowsiness that is so severe you are not able to answer when spoken to, or if asleep, cannot be awakened.</p><p>The <i>Actiq®</i> product contains sugar and may increase your chance for tooth decay. Schedule regular dentist visits if you are using Actiq®.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.</p><p>Using too much of fentanyl may cause reduced infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using fentanyl if you plan to have children.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal (eg, St. John's wort) or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Fentanyl side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
