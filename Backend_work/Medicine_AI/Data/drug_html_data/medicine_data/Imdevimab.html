The mixture of these two medicines is called Regen-COV.</p><p>Imdevimab and casirivimab have not been approved to treat coronavirus or COVID-19. However, these medicines may help prevent the need for emergency medical care or admission to a hospital because of COVID-19. Regen-COV is not authorized for use in people who are already in the hospital or receiving supplemental oxygen for COVID-19.</p><p>Imdevimab may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Imdevimab has not been approved to treat coronavirus or COVID-19. It is not yet known if  imdevimab is an effective treatment for any condition.</p><p>The FDA has authorized emergency use of imdevimab in combination with casirivimab only in people with COVID-19 who are not in a hospital or using supplemental oxygen.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>
