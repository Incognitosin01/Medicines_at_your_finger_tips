Complete-RF Prenatal can also be beneficial in improving the nutritional status of women prior to conception.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 1.0 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><h3>WARNING</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies on this product have not been performed in sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac functions, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions with iron therapy may include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dark stools and abdominal pain. Adverse reactions with iron therapy are usually transient. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>Complete-RF Prenatal Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">One tablet daily or as prescribed by a physician.</p><h2>How is Complete-RF Prenatal Supplied</h2><p class="First">Complete-RF Prenatal is supplied in bottles of 90 tablets.</p><p>NDC 13811-008-90</p><h3>STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Store at Controlled Room Temperature 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30° C (59°- 86°F).
