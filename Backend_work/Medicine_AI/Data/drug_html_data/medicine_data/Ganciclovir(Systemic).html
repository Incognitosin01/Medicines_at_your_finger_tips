Based on animal data, ganciclovir has the potential to cause birth defects and cancers in humans.</b></p><p>• Hematologic toxicity: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia may occur. </b>Neutropenia usually occurs during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment but may occur at any time; cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days of treatment discontinuation. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving ganciclovir. Use with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Frequently monitor complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients who have previously experienced drug-induced leukopenia or who have neutrophil counts &lt;1,000 cells/mm<sup>3 </sup>at the beginning of treatment. Ganciclovir is not recommended in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL, or platelet count &lt;25,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>• Renal toxicity: Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and transplant patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (eg, cyclosporine, amphotericin B). Monitor renal function during therapy, especially in elderly patients and those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dosage adjustment recommended.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Elderly: Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported; use with caution and closely monitor serum creatinine.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Administration: Ensure patients are adequately hydrated. Avoid rapid infusion. Phlebitis and/or pain may occur at injection site despite adequate dilution; infuse solution into veins with adequate blood flow.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential and platelet count at baseline and twice weekly, serum creatinine at baseline and once weekly (Tice 2004); pregnancy test prior to initiation in females of reproductive potential; frequent ophthalmological exams in patients with CMV retinitis.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: Based on animal data and limited human data, </b><b>ganciclovir may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males and suppression of fertility in females. </b></p><p>Female patients should undergo pregnancy testing prior to initiation and use effective contraception during and for at least 30 days after therapy. Male patients should use a barrier contraceptive during and for at least 90 days after therapy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Ganciclovir crosses the placenta. <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Based on animal data, ganciclovir has the potential to cause birth defects in humans.</b></p><p>Adverse events following congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may also occur. Hearing loss, mental retardation, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems have been observed in infants with congenital CMV infection.</p><p>The indications for treating maternal CMV retinitis during pregnancy are the same as in nonpregnant HIV infected women. In general, intravitreous injections for local therapy are preferred for retinal disease to limit systemic exposure during the first trimester when possible. Ganciclovir is not the preferred systemic therapy in pregnant women. Close fetal monitoring is recommended (HHS [OI adult 2019]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat a viral infection of the eyes in people with immune system problems.</p><p>• It is used to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease after organ transplant.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
