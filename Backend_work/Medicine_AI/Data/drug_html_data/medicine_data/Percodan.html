Aspirin belongs to a group of drugs called salicylates. It works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation. Oxycodone is an opioid pain medication. An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic.</p><p>Percodan is used to relieve moderate to severe pain.</p><p>Percodan may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Oxycodone can slow or stop your breathing. <b>Never take Percodan in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed.</b></p><p>Oxycodone may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. <b>Take Percodan exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Never share the medicine with another person. MISUSE OF NARCOTIC PAIN MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Aspirin should not be given to a child or teenager who has a fever, especially if the child also has flu symptoms or chicken pox. Aspirin can cause a serious and sometimes fatal condition called Reye's syndrome in children.</p><p>You should not take Percodan if you have a bleeding disorder, a recent history of stomach or intestinal bleeding, if you take a blood thinner, or if you are allergic to aspirin, oxycodone, or an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) such as Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn, Cataflam, Celecoxib, Feldene, Indocin, Mobic, Toradol, Voltaren, and others. Do not use Percodan if you have used a MAO inhibitor such as furazolidone (Furoxone), isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), or tranylcypromine (Parnate) in the last 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur, leading to serious side effects.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not take Percodan if you are allergic to aspirin or oxycodone, or if you have:</p><ul>

Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p>Taking aspirin during late pregnancy may cause bleeding in the mother or the baby during delivery.</p><p>Aspirin and oxycodone can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while you are using Percodan.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Percodan?</h2><p>Take Percodan exactly as prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Never take this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Oxycodone may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC PAIN MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription. Selling or giving away Percodan to any other person is against the law.</b></p><p>Always check your bottle to make sure you have received the correct pills (same brand and type) of medicine prescribed by your doctor. Ask the pharmacist if you have any questions about the medicine you receive at the pharmacy.</p><p>Percodan may be taken with food if it upsets your stomach.</p><p>If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using Percodan. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time.</p><p>Do not stop using Percodan suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><p>Keep track of your medicine. Oxycodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover Percodan tablets. Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush any unused tablets down the toilet. Disposal of medicines by flushing is recommended to reduce the danger of accidental overdose causing death. This advice applies to a very small number of medicines only. The FDA, working with the manufacturer, has determined this method to be the most appropriate route of disposal and presents the least risk to human safety.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Percodan is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An opioid overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include severe drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, slow breathing, or no breathing.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you get naloxone (a medicine to reverse an opioid overdose) and keep it with you at all times. A person caring for you can give the naloxone if you stop breathing or don't wake up. Your caregiver must still get emergency medical help and may need to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on you while waiting for help to arrive.</p><p>Anyone can buy naloxone from a pharmacy or local health department. Make sure any person caring for you knows where you keep naloxone and how to use it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid?</h2><p><b>Avoid drinking alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>This medication may impair your thinking or reactions. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Percodan will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other over-the-counter cold, allergy, or pain medicine. Aspirin is contained in many combination medicines. Taking certain products together can cause you to get too much aspirin. Check the label to see if a medicine contains aspirin.</p><p>Ask your doctor before using Percodan if you take an antidepressant such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline (Zoloft), trazodone, or vilazodone. Taking any of these medicines with an NSAID may cause you to bruise or bleed easily.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Percodan side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction to Percodan: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p><b>Oxycodone can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur.</b> A person caring for you should give naloxone and/or seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
