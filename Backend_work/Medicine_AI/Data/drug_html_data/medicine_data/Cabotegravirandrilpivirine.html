It is not known whether  cabotegravir and rilpivirine will harm an unborn baby. However, HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy. Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of cabotegravir and rilpivirine on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breastfeed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><h2>How should I take cabotegravir and rilpivirine?</h2><p><b>At least 28 days before your first injection,</b> you will take cabotegravir and rilpivirine in tablet forms once per day with a meal. This "lead-in dose" will help determine that you can safely use these medicines together. Follow all directions on your prescription label and use the medicines exactly as directed.</p><p>On the last day you take the tablets, you will receive your first injectable dose of this medicine. Cabotegravir and rilpivirine is injected into a muscle once per month. A healthcare provider will give you this medicine as 2 separate injections in opposite sides of your buttocks.</p><p>One month after your first injectable dose, you will begin regular monthly cabotegravir and rilpivirine injections. You will be watched closely for about 10 minutes after each injection, to make sure you do not have a serious reaction.</p><p>The timing of your monthly injections is very important to the success of your HIV treatment. Your doctor may set a calendar day as your "target treatment date" to help keep you on schedule. If needed, you may receive an injection early or late, up to 7 days before or 7 days after your target date.</p><p>You must remain under the care of a doctor while receiving cabotegravir and rilpivirine injections. Stay on schedule to get the most benefit. Missing doses can increase your risk of HIV that is resistant to medication.</p><p>If you stop using cabotegravir and rilpivirine, you will need to start using other HIV medicines within 1 month to prevent your condition from becoming resistant.</p><p>You will need frequent medical tests. Cabotegravir and rilpivirine can have long lasting effects on your body (up to 12 months after your last dose). You may still need medical tests for a short time after you stop using this medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Call your doctor for instructions if you miss an appointment for your cabotegravir and rilpivirine injection.</p><p>If you plan to miss an injection by more than 7 days, you may need to take cabotegravir and rilpivirine tablets each day until your next monthly injection is due. You should start taking the tablets about 1 month after your last injection was given. If needed, daily tablets can replace cabotegravir and rilpivirine injections for up to 2 months in a row.</p><p>If you miss an injection by more that 7 days and you have not started taking the medicine in tablet form, your doctor may need to decide whether or not cabotegravir and rilpivirine is the best treatment for you.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking cabotegravir and rilpivirine?</h2><p>Cabotegravir and rilpivirine is a complete treatment for HIV. Do not use other HIV medications unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Using  cabotegravir and rilpivirine may not prevent your disease from spreading. Do not have unprotected sex or share razors or toothbrushes. Talk with your doctor about safe ways to prevent HIV transmission during sex.
