Maintenance dose: 20 to 40 mg orally once a day<br/>
Maximum dose: 80 mg orally once a day<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
-The initial dose is 5 mg orally once a day in patients receiving a diuretic.<br/>
-The 80 mg dose is used but does not appear to give greater effect.<br/>
-If blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg). After the addition of a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Congestive Heart Failure:</b></p><p>Initial dose: 2.5 to 5 mg orally once a day<br/>
Maintenance dose: Dosage should be increased as tolerated<br/>
Maximum dose: 40 mg orally once a day<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
-The diuretic dose may need to be adjusted to help minimize hypovolemia, which may contribute to hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of lisinopril does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug.</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Myocardial Infarction:</b></p><p>Initial dose: 5 mg orally (within 24 hours of the onset of acute myocardial infarction)<br/>
Subsequent doses: 5 mg orally after 24 hours, then 10 mg orally after 48 hours.<br/>
Maintenance dose: 10 mg orally once a day. Dosing should continue for at least 6 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
-Therapy should be initiated at 2.5 mg in patients with a low systolic blood pressure (less than or equal to 120 mm Hg and greater than 100 mmHg) during the first 3 days after the infarct. If prolonged hypotension occurs (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) therapy should be withdrawn.<br/>
<br/>
Uses: Reduction of mortality in acute myocardial infarction</p><p><b>Usual Adult Dose for Diabetic Nephropathy:</b></p><p>Initial dose: 10 to 20 mg orally once a day<br/>
Maintenance dose: 20 to 40 mg orally once a day<br/>
