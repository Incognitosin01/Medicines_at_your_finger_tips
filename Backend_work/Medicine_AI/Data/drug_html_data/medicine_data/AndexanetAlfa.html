Gently swirl vial until complete dissolution of powder. Do not shake. Typical dissolution time 3 to 5 minutes; if dissolution is incomplete, discard vial and do not use. Reconstituted solution contains andexanet alfa at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.</p><p><i>IV bolus:</i> Use a ≥60 mL syringe with a ≥20 gauge needle to withdraw reconstituted solution from the vial and transfer the solution into an empty polyolefin or polyvinyl chloride IV bag with a volume of ≤250 mL.</p><p><i>Continuous IV infusion:</i> Use the same procedure described above. May use more than one 40 to 60 mL syringe or a 100 mL syringe to transfer reconstituted solution to IV bag.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: For IV administration. Initiate bolus at a target rate of ~30 mg/minute. For IV infusion, use of a 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line polyethersulfone or equivalent low protein-binding filter is required.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact vials at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Do not freeze. Reconstituted vials are stable at room temperature ≤8 hours, or may be stored ≤24 hours at 2°C to 8°C. Reconstituted solution in IV bags is stable at room temperature ≤8 hours.

Monitor for thromboembolic events and initiate anticoagulation when medically appropriate. Monitor for symptoms and signs that precede cardiac arrest and provide treatment as needed.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Anti-factor Xa activity re-elevation: There is a rapid and substantial decrease in anti-factor Xa activity corresponding to the bolus dose, which is sustained during the continuous infusion. Anti-factor Xa activity returns to placebo levels ~2 hours after completion of bolus or continuous infusion; thereafter, anti-factor Xa activity decreases at a rate similar to the clearance of factor Xa inhibitors.</p><p>• Thromboembolic and ischemic risks: Arterial and venous thromboembolic events, ischemic events, and cardiac events (including sudden death) were observed within 3 to 30 days postadministration (median time to first event: 7 days). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, ischemic events, and cardiac arrest. To reduce thromboembolic risk, resume anticoagulant therapy as soon as medically appropriate following treatment with andexanet alfa. Safety has not been evaluated in patients with thromboembolic events or disseminated intravascular coagulation within 2 weeks prior to the bleeding event or in patients who received prothrombin complex concentrates, recombinant factor VIIa, or whole blood products within 7 days prior to the bleeding event.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Signs/symptoms of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, ischemic events, or cardiac arrest</p><p>Signs/symptoms of hemostasis; if available, the preferred test to rule out clinically significant serum concentrations and quantify anticoagulant effect is anti-factor Xa activity individually calibrated to each specific factor Xa inhibitor (undetectable anti-factor Xa activity likely excludes clinically relevant drug concentrations). An anti-factor Xa activity assay calibrated for low molecular weight heparin can rule out clinically relevant drug concentrations of a factor Xa inhibitor DOAC but is not useful for quantification (ACC [Tomaselli 2020]; AHA [Raval 2017]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to undo the effects of a certain blood thinner.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
