</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Alendronate Oral Solution</h2><h3>Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women</h3><p class="First">Alendronate sodium is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, alendronate increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures) <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies (</span>14.1<span class="Bold">)</span>]</span>.</p><h3>Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First">Alendronate sodium is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Clinical Studies</span><span class="Bold">(</span>14.3<span class="Bold">)</span>]</span>.</p><h3>Important Limitations of Use</h3><p class="First">The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.</p><h2>Alendronate Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage is:</p><h3>Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage is:</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Instruct patients to do the following:</p><h3>Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation</h3><p class="First">Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.2<span class="Bold">)</span>]</span>. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.</p><p>Patients treated with glucocorticoids should receive adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D.</p><h3>Administration Instructions for Missed Doses</h3><p class="First">If a once-weekly dose of alendronate sodium is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Alendronate sodium is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Alendronate, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers).</p><p>Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate. In some cases these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn.</p><p>The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate and/or who fail to swallow oral bisphosphonates including alendronate with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration (</span>2.6<span class="Bold">)</span>]</span>. In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with alendronate should be used under appropriate supervision.</p><p>There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions (</span>6.2<span class="Bold">)</span>]</span>.</p><h3>Mineral Metabolism</h3><p class="First">Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with alendronate [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Bold">Contraindications (4)</span></span>]. Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with alendronate.</p><p>Presumably due to the effects of alendronate on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in patients with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom calcium absorption may be decreased.</p><p>Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in patients with Paget's disease of bone and in patients receiving glucocorticoids.</p><h3>Musculoskeletal Pain</h3><p class="First">In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions (</span>6.2<span class="Bold">)</span>]</span>. This category of drugs includes alendronate. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.</p><p>In placebo-controlled clinical studies of alendronate, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate and placebo groups.</p><h3>Osteonecrosis of the Jaw</h3><p class="First">Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including alendronate. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates.</p><p>For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.</p><p>Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment.</p><h3>Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures</h3><p class="First">Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.</p><p>Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture.</p><p>Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Alendronate is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min.</p><h3>Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First">The risk versus benefit of alendronate sodium for treatment at daily dosages of glucocorticoids less than 7.5 mg of prednisone or equivalent has not been established <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.4)].</span> Before initiating treatment, the gonadal hormonal status of both men and women should be ascertained and appropriate replacement considered.</p><p>A bone mineral density measurement should be made at the initiation of therapy and repeated after 6 to 12 months of combined alendronate sodium and glucocorticoid treatment.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p><span class="Italics">Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Daily Dosing:</span> The safety of alendronate in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in four clinical trials that enrolled 7453 women aged 44 to 84 years. Study 1 and Study 2 were identically designed, three-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies (United States and Multinational n=994); Study 3 was the three-year vertebral fracture cohort of the Fracture Intervention Trial [FIT] (n=2027) and Study 4 was the four-year clinical fracture cohort of FIT (n=4432). Overall, 3620 patients were exposed to placebo and 3432 patients exposed to alendronate. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were included in these clinical trials. In Study 1 and Study 2 all women received 500 mg elemental calcium as carbonate. In Study 3 and Study 4 all women with dietary calcium intake less than 1000 mg per day received 500 mg calcium and 250 international units Vitamin D per day.</p><p>Among patients treated with alendronate 10 mg or placebo in Study 1 and Study 2, and all patients in Study 3 and Study 4, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 1.8% in the placebo group and 1.8% in the alendronate group. The incidence of serious adverse event was 30.7% in the placebo group and 30.9% in the alendronate group. The percentage of patients who discontinued the study due to any clinical adverse event was 9.5% in the placebo group and 8.9% in the alendronate group. Adverse reactions from these studies considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients treated with either alendronate or placebo are presented in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal</span></p><p class="First">6.6</p><p class="First">4.8</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">3.6</p><p class="First">4.0</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">3.6</p><p class="First">3.5</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">1.2</p><p class="First">3.1</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">3.1</p><p class="First">1.8</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">2.6</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">2.0</p><p class="First">4.3</p><p class="First">1.1</p><p class="First">0.9</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.8</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">1.3</p><p class="First">0.6</p><p class="First">0.7</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal</span></p><p class="First">4.1</p><p class="First">2.5</p><p class="First">0.4</p><p class="First">0.3</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Nervous System/Psychiatric</span></p><p class="First">2.6</p><p class="First">1.5</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.2</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Special Senses</span></p><p class="First">0.5</p><p class="First">1.0</p><p class="First">0.1</p><p class="First">0.0</p><p>Rash and erythema have occurred.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions:</span></p><p>One patient treated with alendronate (10 mg/day), who had a history of peptic ulcer disease and gastrectomy and who was taking concomitant aspirin, developed an anastomotic ulcer with mild hemorrhage, which was considered drug related.

Therefore, instruct patients to wait at least one-half hour after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medications.</p><h3>Aspirin</h3><p class="First">In clinical studies, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was increased in patients receiving concomitant therapy with daily doses of alendronate greater than 10 mg and aspirin-containing products.</p><h3>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h3><p class="First">Alendronate may be administered to patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In a 3-year, controlled, clinical study (n=2027) during which a majority of patients received concomitant NSAIDs, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was similar in patients taking alendronate 5 or 10 mg/day compared to those taking placebo. However, since NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be used during concomitant use with alendronate.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary:</span></p><p>Available data on the use of alendronate in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Discontinue alendronate when pregnancy is recognized.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, daily oral administration of alendronate to rats from before mating through the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation survival and decreased pup body weight gain starting at doses equivalent to less than half of the highest recommended 40 mg clinical daily dose (based on body surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). Oral administration of alendronate to rats during organogenesis resulted in reduced fetal ossification starting at doses 3 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose. No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at doses equivalent to approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose.</p><p>Delayed or failed delivery of offspring, protracted parturition, and late pregnancy maternal and fetal deaths due to maternal hypocalcemia occurred in rats at oral doses as low as one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose (see Data).</p><p>Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from which they are gradually released over a period of years. The amount of bisphosphonate incorporated into adult bone and available for release into the systemic circulation is directly related to the dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Consequently, based on the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates, there is a potential risk of fetal harm, predominantly skeletal, if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Italics">Data:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span>: Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. Incidence of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose).</p><p>Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) resulting in delays and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose). Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) for varying gestational time periods. These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in the drinking water or by subcutaneous minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary:</span></p><p>It is not known whether alendronate is present in human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for alendronate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from alendronate or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Alendronate is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of alendronate were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4 to 18 years, with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate daily (weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo-treated patients. Treatment with alendronate did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen percent of the alendronate patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when assessed radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate and placebo groups in reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults.</p><p>The overall safety profile of alendronate in osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate. However, there was an increased occurrence of vomiting in osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated with alendronate compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with alendronate and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo.</p><p>In a pharmacokinetic study, 6 of 24 pediatric osteogenesis imperfecta patients who received a single oral dose of alendronate 35 or 70 mg developed fever, flu-like symptoms, and/or mild lymphocytopenia within 24 to 48 hours after administration. These events, lasting no more than 2 to 3 days and responding to acetaminophen, are consistent with an acute-phase response that has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates, including alendronate <span class="Italics">[see <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions (</span>6.2<span class="Bold">)</span>]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the patients receiving alendronate in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), 71% (n=2302) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 17% (n=550) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age.

Bisphosphonates are synthetic analogs of pyrophosphate that bind to the hydroxyapatite found in bone.</p><p>Alendronate sodium is chemically described as (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene) bisphosphonic acid monosodium salt trihydrate.</p><p>The empirical formula of alendronate sodium is C<span class="Sub">4</span>H<span class="Sub">12</span>NNaO<span class="Sub">7</span>P<span class="Sub">2</span>∙3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and its formula weight is 325.12. The structural formula is:</p><p>Alendronate sodium USP is a white powder. It is soluble in water, very slightly soluble in alcohol, and practically insoluble in chloroform.</p><p>Each bottle of the oral solution contains 91.35 mg of alendronate monosodium salt trihydrate, which is the molar equivalent to 70 mg of free acid. Each bottle also contains the following inactive ingredients: citric acid (anhydrous), methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, raspberry blend, saccharin sodium and sodium citrate.</p><h2>Alendronate Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [<span class="Sup">3</span>H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover.</p><p><span class="Italics">Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women:</span></p><p>Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15 to 30-fold. It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality.</p><p>Daily oral doses of alendronate (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months.</p><p>Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as one month and at three to six months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady-state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone.</p><p>As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption.</p><p><span class="Italics">Osteoporosis in Men:</span></p><p>Treatment of men with osteoporosis with alendronate 10 mg/day for two years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate 70 mg.</p><p><span class="Italics">Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis:</span></p><p>Sustained use of glucocorticoids is commonly associated with development of osteoporosis and resulting fractures (especially vertebral, hip, and rib). It occurs both in males and females of all ages. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of inhibited bone formation and increased bone resorption resulting in net bone loss. Alendronate decreases bone resorption without directly inhibiting bone formation.</p><p>In clinical studies of up to two years’ duration, alendronate 5 and 10 mg/day reduced cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (a marker of bone resorption) by approximately 60% and reduced bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and total serum alkaline phosphatase (markers of bone formation) by approximately 15 to 30% and 8 to 18%, respectively. As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, alendronate 5 and 10 mg/day induced asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium (approximately 1 to 2%) and serum phosphate (approximately 1 to 8%).</p><p><span class="Italics">Paget's Disease of Bone:</span></p><p>Paget’s disease of bone is a chronic, focal skeletal disorder characterized by greatly increased and disorderly bone remodeling. Excessive osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by osteoblastic new bone formation, leading to the replacement of the normal bone architecture by disorganized, enlarged, and weakened bone structure.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of Paget’s disease range from no symptoms to severe morbidity due to bone pain, bone deformity, pathological fractures, and neurological and other complications. Serum alkaline phosphatase, the most frequently used biochemical index of disease activity, provides an objective measure of disease severity and response to therapy.</p><p>Alendronate decreases the rate of bone resorption directly, which leads to an indirect decrease in bone formation. In clinical trials, alendronate 40 mg once daily for six months produced significant decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase as well as in urinary markers of bone collagen degradation. As a result of the inhibition of bone resorption, alendronate induced generally mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Absorption:</span></p><p>Relative to an intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in men (0.59%) was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast.</p><p>Alendronate 70 mg oral solution and alendronate 70 mg tablet are equally bioavailable.</p><p>A study examining the effect of timing of a meal on the bioavailability of alendronate was performed in 49 postmenopausal women. Bioavailability was decreased (by approximately 40%) when 10 mg alendronate was administered either 0.5 or 1 hour before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 2 hours before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast.</p><p>Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with or up to two hours after a standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution:</span></p><p>Preclinical studies (in male rats) show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/kg intravenous administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine. The mean steady-state volume of distribution, exclusive of bone, is at least 28 L in humans. Concentrations of drug in plasma following therapeutic oral doses are too low (less than 5 ng/mL) for analytical detection. Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span></p><p>There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolized in animals or humans.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion:</span></p><p>Following a single intravenous dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C] alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the feces. Following a single 10 mg intravenous dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 mL/min (64, 78; 90% confidence interval [CI]), and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 mL/min. Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within 6 hours following intravenous administration. The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed 10 years, probably reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton. Based on the above, it is estimated that after 10 years of oral treatment with alendronate (10 mg daily) the amount of alendronate released daily from the skeleton is approximately 25% of that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p><span class="Italics">Specific Populations:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Gender:</span> Bioavailability and the fraction of an intravenous dose excreted in urine were similar in men and women.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric:</span> Bioavailability and disposition (urinary excretion) were similar in elderly and younger patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race:</span> Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment:</span> Preclinical studies show that, in rats with kidney failure, increasing amounts of drug are present in plasma, kidney, spleen, and tibia. In healthy controls, drug that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine. No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found after 3 weeks dosing with cumulative intravenous doses of 35 mg/kg in young male rats. Although no formal renal impairment pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function.</p><p>No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min. Alendronate is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in renal failure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment:</span> As there is evidence that alendronate is not metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment.

In this assay, the lowest dose of alendronate that interfered with bone mineralization (leading to osteomalacia) was 6000-fold the antiresorptive dose. The corresponding ratio for etidronate was one to one. These data suggest that alendronate administered in therapeutic doses is highly unlikely to induce osteomalacia.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Daily Dosing:</span></p><p>The efficacy of alendronate 10 mg daily was assessed in four clinical trials.

There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48% relative risk reduction). A reduction in the total number of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed.

<span class="Bold">Alendronate 10 mg/day at Three Years</span></p><p>At three years significant increases in BMD, relative both to baseline and placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who received alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, suggesting that the increases in bone mass of the spine and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as early as three months and continued throughout the three years of treatment. (See <span class="Bold">Figure 3</span> for lumbar spine results.) In the two-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional increases between years 3 and 5: lumbar spine, 0.94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at the femoral neck, forearm and total body were maintained. Alendronate was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Figure 3:</span> </p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Osteoporosis Treatment Studies in Postmenopausal Women</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Time Course of Effect of Alendronate 10 mg/day Versus Placebo:</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Lumbar Spine BMD Percent Change From Baseline</span></p><p class="First"></p><p>In patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with alendronate 10 mg/day for one or two years, the effects of treatment withdrawal were assessed. Following discontinuation, there were no further increases in bone mass and the rates of bone loss were similar to those of the placebo groups.</p><p><span class="Italics">Bone Histology:</span> Bone histology in 270 postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with alendronate at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/day for one, two, or three years revealed normal mineralization and structure, as well as the expected decrease in bone turnover relative to placebo. These data, together with the normal bone histology and increased bone strength observed in rats and baboons exposed to long-term alendronate treatment, support the conclusion that bone formed during therapy with alendronate is of normal quality.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect on Height:</span> Alendronate, over a three- or four-year period, was associated with statistically significant reductions in loss of height vs. placebo in patients with and without baseline radiographic vertebral fractures. At the end of the FIT studies, the between-treatment group differences were 3.2 mm in the Three-Year Study and 1.3 mm in the Four-Year Study.</p><p><span class="Bold">Weekly Dosing:</span> The therapeutic equivalence of once-weekly alendronate 70 mg (n=519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n=370) was demonstrated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1% (4.8, 5.4%; 95% CI) in the 70-mg once-weekly group (n=440) and 5.4% (5.0, 5.8%; 95% CI) in the 10-mg daily group (n=330). The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary analysis of completers.</p><p><span class="Italics">Concomitant Use with Estrogen/Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):</span> The effects on BMD of treatment with alendronate 10 mg once daily and conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg/day) either alone or in combination were assessed in a two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of hysterectomized postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n=425). At two years, the increases in lumbar spine BMD from baseline were significantly greater with the combination (8.3%) than with either estrogen or alendronate alone (both 6.0%).</p><p>The effects on BMD when alendronate was added to stable doses (for at least one year) of HRT (estrogen ± progestin) were assessed in a one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (n=428). The addition of alendronate 10 mg once daily to HRT produced, at one year, significantly greater increases in lumbar spine BMD (3.7%) vs. HRT alone (1.1%).</p><p>In these studies, significant increases or favorable trends in BMD for combined therapy compared with HRT alone were seen at the total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter. No significant effect was seen for total body BMD.</p><p>Histomorphometric studies of transiliac biopsies in 92 subjects showed normal bone architecture. Compared to placebo there was a 98% suppression of bone turnover (as assessed by mineralizing surface) after 18 months of combined treatment with alendronate and HRT, 94% on alendronate alone, and 78% on HRT alone. The long-term effects of combined alendronate and HRT on fracture occurrence and fracture healing have not been studied.</p><h3>Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Daily Dosing:</span></p><p>Prevention of bone loss was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of postmenopausal women 40-60 years of age. One thousand six hundred nine patients (alendronate 5 mg/day; n=498) who were at least six months postmenopausal were entered into a two-year study without regard to their baseline BMD. In the other study, 447 patients (alendronate 5 mg/day; n=88), who were between six months and three years postmenopause, were treated for up to three years. In the placebo-treated patients BMD losses of approximately 1% per year were seen at the spine, hip (femoral neck and trochanter) and total body. In contrast, alendronate 5 mg/day prevented bone loss in the majority of patients and induced significant increases in mean bone mass at each of these sites (see Figure 4). In addition, alendronate 5 mg/day reduced the rate of bone loss at the forearm by approximately half relative to placebo. Alendronate 5 mg/day was similarly effective in this population regardless of age, time since menopause, race and baseline rate of bone turnover.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 4.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Bone Histology</span></p><p>Bone histology was normal in the 28 patients biopsied at the end of three years who received alendronate at doses of up to 10 mg/day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Weekly Dosing</span></p><p>The therapeutic equivalence of once weekly alendronate 35 mg (n=362) and alendronate 5 mg daily (n=361) was demonstrated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women without osteoporosis. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 2.9% (2.6, 3.2%; 95% CI) in the 35-mg once-weekly group (n=307) and 3.2% (2.9, 3.5%; 95% CI) in the 5-mg daily group (n=298). The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary analysis of completers.</p><h3>Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of alendronate in men with hypogonadal or idiopathic osteoporosis was demonstrated in two clinical studies.</p><p><span class="Italics">Daily Dosing:</span> A two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of alendronate 10 mg once daily enrolled a total of 241 men between the ages of 31 and 87 (mean, 63). All patients in the trial had either a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the femoral neck and less than or equal to -1 at the lumbar spine, or a baseline osteoporotic fracture and a BMD T-score less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck. At two years, the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD in men receiving alendronate 10 mg/day were significant at the following sites: lumbar spine, 5.3%; femoral neck, 2.6%; trochanter, 3.1%; and total body, 1.6%. Treatment with alendronate also reduced height loss (alendronate, -0.6 mm vs. placebo, -2.4 mm).</p><p><span class="Italics">Weekly Dosing:</span> A one-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of once weekly alendronate 70 mg enrolled a total of 167 men between the ages of 38 and 91 (mean, 66). Patients in the study had either a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the femoral neck and less than or equal to -1 at the lumbar spine, or a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the lumbar spine and less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck, or a baseline osteoporotic fracture and a BMD T-score less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck. At one year, the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD in men receiving alendronate 70 mg once weekly were significant at the following sites: lumbar spine, 2.8%; femoral neck, 1.9%; trochanter, 2.0%; and total body, 1.2%. These increases in BMD were similar to those seen at one year in the 10 mg once-daily study.</p><p>In both studies, BMD responses were similar regardless of age (greater than or equal to 65 years vs. less than 65 years), gonadal function (baseline testosterone less than 9 ng/dL vs. greater than or equal to 9 ng/dL), or baseline BMD (femoral neck and lumbar spine T-score less than or equal to -2.5 vs. greater than -2.5).</p><h3>Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of alendronate 5 and 10 mg once daily in men and women receiving glucocorticoids (at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) was demonstrated in two, one-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies of virtually identical design, one performed in the United States and the other in 15 different countries (Multinational [which also included alendronate 2.5 mg/day]). These studies enrolled 232 and 328 patients, respectively, between the ages of 17 and 83 with a variety of glucocorticoid-requiring diseases. Patients received supplemental calcium and vitamin D. Figure 5 shows the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate 5 mg/day for each study.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 5:</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Studies in Glucocorticoid – Treated Patients</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Increase in BMD</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Alendronate 5mg/day at One Year</span></p><p>After one year, significant increases relative to placebo in BMD were seen in the combined studies at each of these sites in patients who received alendronate 5 mg/day. In the placebo-treated patients, a significant decrease in BMD occurred at the femoral neck (-1.2%), and smaller decreases were seen at the lumbar spine and trochanter. Total body BMD was maintained with alendronate 5 mg/day. The increases in BMD with alendronate 10 mg/day were similar to those with alendronate 5 mg/day in all patients except for postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy. In these women, the increases (relative to placebo) with alendronate 10 mg/day were greater than those with alendronate 5 mg/day at the lumbar spine (4.1% vs. 1.6%) and trochanter (2.8% vs. 1.7%), but not at other sites. Alendronate was effective regardless of dose or duration of glucocorticoid use. In addition, alendronate was similarly effective regardless of age (less than 65 vs. greater than or equal to 65 years), race (Caucasian vs. other races), gender, underlying disease, baseline BMD, baseline bone turnover, and use with a variety of common medications.</p><p>Bone histology was normal in the 49 patients biopsied at the end of one year who received alendronate at doses of up to 10 mg/day.</p><p>Of the original 560 patients in these studies, 208 patients who remained on at least 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent continued into a one-year double-blind extension. After two years of treatment, spine BMD increased by 3.7% and 5.0% relative to placebo with alendronate 5 and 10 mg/day, respectively. Significant increases in BMD (relative to placebo) were also observed at the femoral neck, trochanter, and total body.</p><p>After one year, 2.3% of patients treated with alendronate 5 or 10 mg/day (pooled) vs. 3.7% of those treated with placebo experienced a new vertebral fracture (not significant). However, in the population studied for two years, treatment with alendronate (pooled dosage groups: 5 or 10 mg for two years or 2.5 mg for one year followed by 10 mg for one year) significantly reduced the incidence of patients with a new vertebral fracture (alendronate 0.7% vs. placebo 6.8%).</p><h3>Treatment of Paget’s Disease of Bone</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of alendronate 40 mg once daily for six months was demonstrated in two double-blind clinical studies of male and female patients with moderate to severe Paget’s disease (alkaline phosphatase at least twice the upper limit of normal): a placebo-controlled, multinational study and a U.S. comparative study with etidronate disodium 400 mg/day. Figure 6 shows the mean percent changes from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase for up to six months of randomized treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 6: Studies in Paget’s Disease of Bone</span></p><p>At six months the suppression in alkaline phosphatase in patients treated with alendronate was significantly greater than that achieved with etidronate and contrasted with the complete lack of response in placebo-treated patients. Response (defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase or decrease from baseline greater than or equal to 60%) occurred in approximately 85% of patients treated with alendronate in the combined studies vs. 30% in the etidronate group and 0% in the placebo group. alendronate was similarly effective regardless of age, gender, race, prior use of other bisphosphonates, or baseline alkaline phosphatase within the range studied (at least twice the upper limit of normal).</p><p>Bone histology was evaluated in 33 patients with Paget’s disease treated with alendronate 40 mg/day for 6 months. As in patients treated for osteoporosis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>, alendronate did not impair mineralization, and the expected decrease in the rate of bone turnover was observed. Normal lamellar bone was produced during treatment with alendronate, even where preexisting bone was woven and disorganized. Overall, bone histology data support the conclusion that bone formed during treatment with alendronate is of normal quality.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alendronate Sodium Oral Solution</span></p><p><span class="Bold">70 mg oral solution is supplied as a clear, colorless to pale pink solution with a raspberry flavor.</span></p><p>NDC 0054-<span class="Bold">0282</span>-59 unit-of-use cartons of 4 single-dose bottles containing 75 mL each</p><p>Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F).
