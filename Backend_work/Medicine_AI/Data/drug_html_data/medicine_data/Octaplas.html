Clotting protein deficiencies can cause excessive bleeding or excessive clotting.</p><p>Octaplas is a sterile, frozen solution of pooled human plasma from several donors that has been treated with a solvent detergent process. This process kills certain viruses and thereby minimizes the risk of serious virus transmission. The plasma used to manufacture Octaplas is collected from U.S. donors who have been screened and tested for diseases transmitted by blood, and determined to be suitable donors.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical studies included shortness of breath, dizziness, chest discomfort, skin itchiness and rashes, headache and tingling sensations.</p><h2>Highlights of Prescribing Information</h2><p>These highlights do not include all the information needed to use Octaplas safely and effectively.
