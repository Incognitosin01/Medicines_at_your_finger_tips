When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>If anaerobic organisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, appropriate therapy should be administered. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Therapy with ciprofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available appropriate therapy should be continued.</p><p>As with other drugs, some isolates of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ciprofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.</p><h2>Ciprofloxacin Injection Concentrate Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP should be administered intravenously at dosages described in the appropriate Dosage Guidelines tables.</p><h3>Dosage in Adults</h3><p class="First">The determination of dosage and duration for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative microorganism, the integrity of the patient’s host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal and hepatic function. </p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Adult Dosage Guidelines</span></p><p class="First"> Patients whose therapy is started with ciprofloxacin injection may be switched to ciprofloxacin Tablets or Oral Suspension when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician (Table 2) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Dosage in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Dosing and initial route of therapy (that is, IV or oral) for cUTI or pyelonephritis should be determined by the severity of the infection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Pediatric Dosage Guidelines</span> </p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction. Dosage guidelines for use in patients with renal impairment are shown in Table 4.</p><p>When only the serum creatinine concentration is known, the following formulas may be used to estimate creatinine clearance:</p><p></p><p>The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.</p><p>In patients with severe infections and severe renal impairment and hepatic insufficiency, careful monitoring is suggested.</p><p>Pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency were excluded from the clinical trial of cUTI and pyelonephritis. No information is available on dosing adjustments necessary for pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (that is, creatinine clearance of &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h3>Preparation of Ciprofloxacin for Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">THIS PREPARATION MUST BE DILUTED BEFORE USE.</span> The intravenous dose should be prepared by aseptically withdrawing the concentrate from the vial of Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP. This should be diluted with a suitable intravenous solution to a final concentration of 1–2 mg/mL. (See <span class="Bold">Compatibility and Stability</span>.) The resulting solution should be infused over a period of 60 minutes by direct infusion or through a Y-type intravenous infusion set which may already be in place.</p><p>If the Y-type or “piggyback” method of administration is used, it is advisable to discontinue temporarily the administration of any other solutions during the infusion of Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP. If the concomitant use of Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP and another drug is necessary each drug should be given separately in accordance with the recommended dosage and route of administration for each drug.</p><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP is available as a 0.2% premixed solution in 5% dextrose in flexible containers of 100 mL and 200 mL. The solutions in flexible containers do not need to be diluted and may be infused as described above.</p><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin injection 1% (10 mg/mL), when diluted with the following intravenous solutions to concentrations of 0.5 to 2.0 mg/mL, is stable for up to 14 days at refrigerated or room temperature storage.</p><p>0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP</p><p>5% Dextrose Injection, USP</p><p>Sterile Water for Injection</p><p>10% Dextrose for Injection</p><p>5% Dextrose and 0.225% Sodium Chloride for Injection</p><p>5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride for Injection</p><p>Lactated Ringer’s for Injection</p><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 60 minutes. Slow infusion of a dilute solution into a larger vein will minimize patient discomfort and reduce the risk of venous irritation.</p><p class="First">Adequate hydration of patients receiving ciprofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine. Crystalluria has been reported with quinolones <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span>5.16<span class="Italics">), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP is available in;<br/>

Premix in Flexible Containers (100mL in 5% Dextrose, 200mg, 0.2% and 200 mL in 5% Dextrose, 400mg, 0.2%), for intravenous infusion.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antibacterials, or any of the product components <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.7</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Tizanidine</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion).These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting ciprofloxacin. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.</p><h3>Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting ciprofloxacin, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.</p><p>The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of ciprofloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness, or other alterations in sensations including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense and vibratory sensation, and/or motor strength in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2).]</span></p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) effects, including convulsions, increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), and toxic psychosis Ciprofloxacin may also cause central nervous system (CNS) events including: nervousness, agitation, insomnia, anxiety, nightmares, paranoia, dizziness, confusion, tremors, hallucinations, depression, and, psychotic reactions have progressed to suicidal ideations/thoughts and self-injurious behavior such as attempted or completed suicide. These reactions may occur following the first dose. Advise patients receiving ciprofloxacin to inform their healthcare provider immediately if these reactions occur, discontinue the drug, and institute appropriate care. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold. As with all fluoroquinolones, use ciprofloxacin with caution in epileptic patients and patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, previous history of convulsion, reduced cerebral blood flow, altered brain structure, or stroke), or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (for example, certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). Use ciprofloxacin when the benefits of treatment exceed the risks, since these patients are endangered because of possible undesirable CNS side effects. Cases of status epilepticus have been reported. If seizures occur, discontinue ciprofloxacin <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid ciprofloxacin in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><h3>Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including ciprofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Italics">Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome);</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness;</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Allergic pneumonitis;</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure;</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure;</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities.</span></li>
</ul><p>Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].</span></p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy, including ciprofloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, including intubation, as indicated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatic necrosis, life-threatening hepatic failure, and fatal events, have been reported with ciprofloxacin. Acute liver injury is rapid in onset (range 1–39 days), and is often associated with hypersensitivity. The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed. Most patients with fatal outcomes were older than 55 years old. In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatitis (such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen), discontinue treatment immediately.</p><p>There can be a temporary increase in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or cholestatic jaundice, especially in patients with previous liver damage, who are treated with ciprofloxacin <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)].</span></p><h3>Serious Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Theophylline</h3><p class="First">Serious and fatal reactions have been reported in patients receiving concurrent administration of Intravenous ciprofloxacin and theophylline. These reactions have included cardiac arrest, seizure, status epilepticus, and respiratory failure. Instances of nausea, vomiting, tremor, irritability, or palpitation have also occurred.</p><p>Although similar serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving theophylline alone, the possibility that these reactions may be potentiated by ciprofloxacin cannot be eliminated. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)-</span>associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ciprofloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span></p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Prolongation of the QT Interval</h3><p class="First">Some fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsade de pointes have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Avoid ciprofloxacin in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, risk factors for QT prolongation or torsade de pointes (for example, congenital long QT syndrome , uncorrected electrolyte imbalance, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and cardiac disease, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, or bradycardia), and patients receiving Class IA antiarrhythmic agents (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III antiarrhythmic agents (amiodarone, sotalol), tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, and antipsychotics. Elderly patients may also be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><h3>Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients and Arthropathic Effects in Animals</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age) only for cUTI, prevention of inhalational anthrax (post exposure), and plague <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.10,</span> 1.6<span class="Italics">,</span>1.7<span class="Italics">)]</span>. An increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls, including reactions related to joints and/or surrounding tissues, has been observed <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In pre-clinical studies, oral administration of ciprofloxacin caused lameness in immature dogs. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species<span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].</span></p><h3>Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity</h3><p class="First">Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, “V” area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, avoid excessive exposure to these sources of light. Discontinue ciprofloxacin if phototoxicity occurs<span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6.1).]</span></p><h3>Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing ciprofloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Potential Risks with Concomitant Use of Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 1A2 Enzymes</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of the hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme pathway. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (for example, theophylline, methylxanthines, caffeine, tizanidine, ropinirole, clozapine, olanzapine) results in increased plasma concentrations of the co-administered drug and could lead to clinically significant pharmacodynamic adverse reactions of the co-administered drug <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Crystalluria</h3><p class="First">Crystals of ciprofloxacin have been observed rarely in the urine of human subjects but more frequently in the urine of laboratory animals, which is usually alkaline <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].</span> Crystalluria related to ciprofloxacin has been reported only rarely in humans because human urine is usually acidic.

Local intravenous site reactions are more frequent if the infusion time is 30 minutes or less. These may appear as local skin reactions that resolve rapidly upon completion of the infusion. Subsequent intravenous administration is not contraindicated unless the reactions recur or worsen.</p><p>In several instances, nausea, vomiting, tremor, irritability, or palpitation were judged by investigators to be related to elevated serum levels of theophylline possibly as a result of drug interaction with ciprofloxacin.</p><p>In randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trials comparing ciprofloxacin (Intravenous and Intravenous/Oral. sequential) with intravenous beta-lactam control antibiotics, the CNS adverse reaction profile of ciprofloxacin was comparable to that of the control drugs.</p><p class="First">Short (6 weeks) and long term (1 year) musculoskeletal and neurological safety of oral/intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of cUTI or pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years) in an international multicenter trial. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). A total of 335 ciprofloxacin- and 349 comparator-treated patients were enrolled.</p><p>An Independent Pediatric Safety Committee (IPSC) reviewed all cases of musculoskeletal adverse reactions including abnormal gait or abnormal joint exam (baseline or treatment-emergent). Within 6 weeks of treatment initiation, the rates of musculoskeletal adverse reactions were 9.3% (31/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 6% (21/349) in comparator-treated patients. All musculoskeletal adverse reactions occurring by 6 weeks resolved (clinical resolution of signs and symptoms), usually within 30 days of end of treatment. Radiological evaluations were not routinely used to confirm resolution of the adverse reactions. Ciprofloxacin-treated patients were more likely to report more than one adverse reaction and on more than one occasion compared to control patients. The rate of musculoskeletal adverse reactions was consistently higher in the ciprofloxacin group compared to the control group across all age subgroups. At the end of 1 year, the rate of these adverse reactions reported at any time during that period was 13.7% (46/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 9.5% (33/349) in the comparator-treated patients (Table 6).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 6: Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions<span class="Sup">1</span></span><span class="Bold">as Assessed by the IPSC</span></p><p><span class="Sup">1</span>.

At both the 6 week and 1 year evaluations, the 95% confidence interval indicated that it could not be concluded that the ciprofloxacin group had findings comparable to the control group.</p><p>The incidence rates of neurological adverse reactions within 6 weeks of treatment initiation were 3% (9/335) in the ciprofloxacin group versus 2% (7/349) in the comparator group and included dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, and somnolence.</p><p>In this trial, the overall incidence rates of adverse reactions within 6 weeks of treatment initiation were 41% (138/335) in the ciprofloxacin group versus 31% (109/349) in the comparator group. The most frequent adverse reactions were gastrointestinal: 15% (50/335) of ciprofloxacin patients compared to 9% (31/349) of comparator patients. Serious adverse reactions were seen in 7.5% (25/335) of ciprofloxacin- treated patients compared to 5.7% (20/349) of control patients. Discontinuation of drug due to an adverse reaction was observed in 3% (10/335) of ciprofloxacin-treated patients versus 1.4% (5/349) of comparator patients. Other adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of ciprofloxacin patients were diarrhea 4.8%, vomiting 4.8%, abdominal pain 3.3%, dyspepsia 2.7%, nausea 2.7%, fever 2.1%, asthma 1.8% and rash 1.8%.</p><p>Short-term safety data for ciprofloxacin was also collected in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients (ages 5–17 years). Sixty seven patients received ciprofloxacin 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for one week followed by ciprofloxacin tablets 20 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours to complete 10–21 days treatment and 62 patients received the combination of ceftazidime intravenous 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours and tobramycin intravenous 3 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for a total of 10–21 days. Periodic musculoskeletal assessments were conducted by treatment- blinded examiners. Patients were followed for an average of 23 days after completing treatment (range 0–93 days). Musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 22% of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 21% in the comparison group. Decreased range of motion was reported in 12% of the subjects in the ciprofloxacin group and 16% in the comparison group. Arthralgia was reported in 10% of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 11% in the comparison group. Other adverse reactions were similar in nature and frequency between treatment arms. The efficacy of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients has not been established.</p><p>In addition to the adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, it should be expected that adverse reactions reported in adults during clinical trials or postmarketing experience may also occur in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide marketing experience with fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 7).</p><h3>Adverse Laboratory Changes</h3><p class="First">Changes in laboratory parameters while on ciprofloxacin therapy are listed below:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Italics">Hepatic-Elevations of AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, LDH, and serum bilirubin</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Hematologic-Elevated eosinophil and platelet counts, decreased platelet counts, hemoglobin and/or hematocrit</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Renal-Elevations of serum creatinine, BUN, and uric acid</span></li>
<li><span class="Italics">Other elevations of serum creatine phosphokinase, serum theophylline (in patients receiving theophylline concomitantly), blood glucose, and triglycerides</span></li>
</ul><p>Other changes occurring were: decreased leukocyte count, elevated atypical lymphocyte count, immature WBCs, elevated serum calcium, elevation of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gGT), decreased BUN, decreased uric acid, decreased total serum protein, decreased serum albumin, decreased serum potassium, elevated serum potassium, elevated serum cholesterol. Other changes occurring during administration of ciprofloxacin were: elevation of serum amylase, decrease of blood glucose, pancytopenia, leukocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate, change in serum phenytoin, decreased prothrombin time, hemolytic anemia, and bleeding diathesis.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co-administered drug.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ciprofloxacin should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to both fetus and mother. An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy by TERIS–the Teratogen Information System–concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data=fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>A controlled prospective observational study followed 200 women exposed to fluoroquinolones (52.5% exposed to ciprofloxacin and 68% first trimester exposures) during gestation.<span class="Sup">3</span> In utero exposure to fluoroquinolones during embryogenesis was not associated with increased risk of major malformations. The reported rates of major congenital malformations were 2.2% for the fluoroquinolone group and 2.6% for the control group (background incidence of major malformations is 1–5%). Rates of spontaneous abortions, prematurity and low birth weight did not differ between the groups and there were no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions up to one year of age in the ciprofloxacin exposed children.</p><p>Another prospective follow-up study reported on 549 pregnancies with fluoroquinolone exposure (93% first trimester exposures).<span class="Sup">4</span> There were 70 ciprofloxacin exposures, all within the first trimester. The malformation rates among live-born babies exposed to ciprofloxacin and to fluoroquinolones overall were both within background incidence ranges. No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found. The study did not reveal any clear adverse reactions due to in utero exposure to ciprofloxacin.</p><p>No differences in the rates of prematurity, spontaneous abortions, or birth weight were seen in women exposed to ciprofloxacin during pregnancy.<span class="Sup">2, 3</span> However, these small postmarketing epidemiology studies, of which most experience is from short term, first trimester exposure, are insufficient to evaluate the risk for less common defects or to permit reliable and definitive conclusions regarding the safety of ciprofloxacin in pregnant women and their developing fetuses.</p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (0.6 and 0.3 times the maximum daily human dose based upon body surface area, respectively) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to ciprofloxacin. In rabbits, oral ciprofloxacin dose levels of 30 and 100 mg/kg (approximately 0.4- and 1.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area) produced gastrointestinal toxicity resulting in maternal weight loss and an increased incidence of abortion, but no teratogenicity was observed at either dose level. After intravenous administration of doses up to 20 mg/kg (approximately 0.3-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area), no maternal toxicity was produced and no embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is excreted in human milk. The amount of ciprofloxacin absorbed by the nursing infant is unknown. Because of the potential risk of serious adverse reactions (including articular damage) in infants nursing from mothers taking ciprofloxacin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Although effective in clinical trials, ciprofloxacin is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls. Quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, cause arthropathy in juvenile animals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].</span></p><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of cUTI and pyelonephritis due to <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age<span class="Italics">.</span> Although effective in clinical trials, ciprofloxacin is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to the controls, including events related to joints and/or surrounding tissues <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients from birth to 17 years of age for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure).

Efficacy studies of ciprofloxacin could not be conducted in humans with pneumonic plague for feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals. The risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.7), Dosage and Administration (2.2), and Clinical Studies (14.4)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential adverse reaction and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p>In a retrospective analysis of 23 multiple-dose controlled clinical trials of ciprofloxacin encompassing over 3500 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 25% of patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 10% were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals on any drug therapy cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (for example, known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternative pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. Nonetheless, some modification of dosage is recommended, particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In preliminary studies in patients with stable chronic liver cirrhosis, no significant changes in ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been observed. The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency, have not been studied.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of acute overdosage, reversible renal toxicity has been reported in some cases. Observe the patient carefully and give supportive treatment, including monitoring of renal function, urinary pH and acidify, if required, to prevent crystalluria. Adequate hydration must be maintained. Only a small amount of ciprofloxacin (less than 10%) is removed from the body after hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>In mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, significant toxicity including tonic/clonic convulsions was observed at intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin between 125mg/kg and 300 mg/kg.</p><h2>Ciprofloxacin Injection Concentrate Description</h2><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP is a synthetic antimicrobial agent for intravenous (IV) administration. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1piperazinyl)-3- quinolinecarboxylic acid. Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">18</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span> and its chemical structure is:</p><p></p><p>Ciprofloxacin is a faint to light yellow crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 331.4. It is soluble in dilute (0.1N) hydrochloric acid and is practically insoluble in water and ethanol. Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP solutions are available as 1% aqueous concentrate in glass vial and sterile 0.2% ready-for-use infusion solutions in 5% Dextrose Injection. Ciprofloxacin Injection, USP contains lactic acid as a solubilizing agent and hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. The pH range for the 1% aqueous concentrates in vials is 3.3 to 3.9. The pH range for the 0.2% ready-for-use infusion solutions is 3.5 to 4.6.</p><p>The plastic container is not made with natural rubber latex. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period, for example, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), up to 5 parts per million. The suitability of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies.</p><p>The glucose content for the 100 mL flexible container is 5 g and 200 mL flexible container is 10 g.</p><h2>Ciprofloxacin Injection Concentrate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following 60-minute intravenous infusions of 200 mg and 400 mg ciprofloxacin to normal volunteers, the mean maximum serum concentrations achieved were 2.1 and 4.6 mcg/mL, respectively; the concentrations at 12 hours were 0.1 and 0.2 mcg/mL, respectively (Table 9).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 9: Steady-state Ciprofloxacin Serum Concentrations (mcg/mL)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">After 60-minute INTRAVENOUS Infusions every 12 hours.</span></p><p><br/>
The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin are linear over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg administered intravenously. Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters following the 1st and 5th intravenous dose on an every 12 hour regimen indicates no evidence of drug accumulation.</p><p>The absolute bioavailability of oral ciprofloxacin is within a range of 70–80% with no substantial loss by first pass metabolism. An intravenous infusion of 400-mg ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 12 hours has been shown to produce an area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) equivalent to that produced by a 500-mg oral dose given every 12 hours. An intravenous infusion of 400 mg ciprofloxacin given over 60 minutes every 8 hours has been shown to produce an AUC at steady-state equivalent to that produced by a 750-mg oral dose given every 12 hours. A 400-mg intravenous dose results in a Cmax similar to that observed with a 750-mg oral dose. An infusion of 200 mg ciprofloxacin given every 12 hours produces an AUC equivalent to that produced by a 250-mg oral dose given every 12 hours (Table 10).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 10: Steady-state Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Multiple Oral and Intravenous Doses</span></p><p class="First">After intravenous administration, ciprofloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body. Tissue concentrations often exceed serum concentrations in both men and women, particularly in genital tissue including the prostate. Ciprofloxacin is present in active form in the saliva, nasal and bronchial secretions, mucosa of the sinuses, sputum, skin blister fluid, lymph, peritoneal fluid, bile, and prostatic secretions. Ciprofloxacin has also been detected in lung, skin, fat, muscle, cartilage, and bone. The drug diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, CSF concentrations are generally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations. Low levels of the drug have been detected in the aqueous and vitreous humors of the eye.</p><p class="First">After intravenous administration, three metabolites of ciprofloxacin have been identified in human urine which together account for approximately 10% of the intravenous dose. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co-administered drug <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.9,5.15) Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><p class="First">The serum elimination half-life is approximately 5–6 hours and the total clearance is around 35 L/hr. After intravenous administration, approximately 50% to 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Following a 200-mg intravenous dose, concentrations in the urine usually exceed 200 mcg/mL 0–2 hours after dosing and are generally greater than 15 mcg/mL 8–12 hours after dosing. Following a 400 mg intravenous dose, urine concentrations generally exceed 400 mcg/mL 0–2 hours after dosing and are usually greater than 30 mcg/mL 8–12 hours after dosing. The renal clearance is approximately 22 L/hr. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete by 24 hours after dosing.</p><p>Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after intravenous dosing, only a small amount of the administered dose (&lt;less than1%) is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. Approximately 15% of an intravenous dose is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing.</p><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the C<span class="Sub">max</span> is increased 16% to 40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly.

There was no apparent age-dependence, and no notable increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> or AUC upon multiple dosing (10 mg/kg three times a day). In children with severe sepsis who were given intravenous ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion), the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 6.1 mcg/mL (range: 4.6 mcg/mL to 8.3 mcg/mL) in 10 children less than 1 year of age; and 7.2 mcg/mL (range: 4.7 mcg/mL to 11.8 mcg/mL) in 10 children between 1 year and 5 years of age. The AUC values were 17.4 mcg*hr/mL (range: 11.8 mcg*hr/mL to 32.0 mcg*hr/mL) and 16.5 mcg*hr/mL (range: 11 mcg*hr/mL to 23.8 mcg*hr/mL) in the respective age groups. These values are within the range reported for adults at therapeutic doses. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of pediatric patients with various infections, the predicted mean half-life in children is approximately 4 hours–5 hours, and the bioavailability of the oral suspension is approximately 60%.</p><p class="First">The serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were not altered when these two drugs were given concomitantly.</p><p class="First">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic exposure of tizanidine (4 mg single dose) was significantly increased (C<span class="Sub">max</span> 7-fold, AUC 10-fold) when the drug was given concomitantly with ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day for 3 days).

Hairless (Skh-1) mice were exposed to UVA light for 3.5 hours five times every two weeks for up to 78 weeks while concurrently being administered ciprofloxacin. The time to development of the first skin tumors was 50 weeks in mice treated concomitantly with UVA and ciprofloxacin (mouse dose approximately equal to maximum recommended human dose based upon body surface area), as opposed to 34 weeks when animals were treated with both UVA and vehicle. The times to development of skin tumors ranged from 16 to 32 weeks in mice treated concomitantly with UVA and other quinolones.<span class="Sup">9</span></p><p>In this model, mice treated with ciprofloxacin alone did not develop skin or systemic tumors. There are no data from similar models using pigmented mice and/or fully haired mice. The clinical significance of these findings to humans is unknown.</p><p>Fertility studies performed in rats at oral doses of ciprofloxacin up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 0.7-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area) revealed no evidence of impairment.</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span>.</p><p>Damage of weight-bearing joints was observed in juvenile dogs and rats. In young beagles, 100 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, given daily for 4 weeks, caused degenerative articular changes of the knee joint. At 30 mg/kg, the effect on the joint was minimal. In a subsequent study in young beagle dogs, oral ciprofloxacin doses of 30 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg ciprofloxacin (approximately 1.3- times and 3.5-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs) given daily for 2 weeks caused articular changes which were still observed by histopathology after a treatment-free period of 5 months. At 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.6-times the pediatric dose based upon comparative plasma AUCs), no effects on joints were observed. This dose was also not associated with arthrotoxicity after an additional treatment-free period of 5 months. In another study, removal of weight bearing from the joint reduced the lesions but did not totally prevent them.</p><p>Crystalluria, sometimes associated with secondary nephropathy, occurs in laboratory animals dosed with ciprofloxacin. This is primarily related to the reduced solubility of ciprofloxacin under alkaline conditions, which predominate in the urine of test animals; in man, crystalluria is rare since human urine is typically acidic. In rhesus monkeys, crystalluria without nephropathy was noted after single oral doses as low as 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.07-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area). After 6 months of intravenous dosing at 10 mg/kg/day, no nephropathological changes were noted; however, nephropathy was observed after dosing at 20 mg/kg/day for the same duration (approximately 0.2-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area).</p><p>In dogs, ciprofloxacin at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg by rapid intravenous injection (15 sec.) produces pronounced hypotensive effects. These effects are considered to be related to histamine release, since they are partially antagonized by pyrilamine, an antihistamine. In rhesus monkeys, rapid intravenous injection also produces hypotension but the effect in this species is inconsistent and less pronounced.</p><p>In mice, concomitant administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone and indomethacin with quinolones has been reported to enhance the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones.</p><p>Ocular toxicity seen with some related drugs has not been observed in ciprofloxacin-treated animals.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Empirical Therapy In Adult Febrile Neutropenic Patients</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin, 400 mg intravenously every 8 hours, in combination with piperacillin sodium, 50 mg/kg intravenously every 4 hours, for the empirical therapy of febrile neutropenic patients were studied in one large pivotal multicenter, randomized trial and were compared to those of tobramycin, 2 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours, in combination with piperacillin sodium, 50 mg/kg intravenously every 4 hours.</p><p>Clinical response rates observed in this study were as follows:</p><p>The clinical success and bacteriologic eradication rates in the Per Protocol population were similar between ciprofloxacin and the comparator group as shown in Table 13.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 13: Clinical Response Rates</span></p><h3>Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis–Efficacy in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Ciprofloxacin, administered IV and/or orally, was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years). The trial was conducted in the US, Canada, Argentina, Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico, South Africa, and Germany.

The mean peak serum concentration achieved at steady-state in human adults receiving 500 mg orally every 12 hours is 2.97 mcg/mL, and 4.56 mcg/mL following 400 mg intravenously every 12 hours. The mean trough serum concentration at steady-state for both of these regimens is 0.2 mcg/mL. In a study of 10 pediatric patients between 6 and 16 years of age, the mean peak plasma concentration achieved is 8.3 mcg/mL and trough concentrations range from 0.09 mcg/mL to 0.26 mcg/mL, following two 30-minute intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg administered 12 hours apart. After the second intravenous infusion patients switched to 15 mg/kg orally every 12 hours achieve a mean peak concentration of 3.6 mcg/mL after the initial oral dose. Long-term safety data, including effects on cartilage, following the administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients are limited.

Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any worsening muscle weakness or breathing problems.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is ciprofloxacin?</span></p><p>Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial medicine used in adults age 18 years and older to treat certain infections caused by certain germs called bacteria. These bacterial infections include:<br/>
   • urinary tract infection<br/>
   • chronic prostate infection<br/>
   • lower respiratory tract infection<br/>
   • sinus infection<br/>
   • skin infection<br/>
   • bone and joint infection<br/>
   • nosocomial pneumonia<br/>
   • intra-abdominal infection, complicated<br/>
   • infectious diarrhea<br/>
   • typhoid (enteric) fever<br/>
   • cervical and urethral gonorrhea, uncomplicated<br/>
   • people with a low white blood cell count and a fever<br/>
   • inhalational anthrax<br/>
   • plague</p><p>      o Studies of ciprofloxacin for use in the treatment of plague and anthrax were done in animals only, because plague and anthrax could not be studied in people.<br/>
      o Ciprofloxacin should not be used in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute uncomplicated cystitis, and sinus infections, if there are other treatment options available.<br/>
      o Ciprofloxacin should not be used as the first choice of antibacterial medicine to treat lower respiratory tract infections cause by a certain type of bacterial called Streptococcus pneumoniae.<br/>
      o <span class="Bold">Ciprofloxacin is also used in children younger than 18 years of age</span> to treat complicated urinary tract and kidney infections or who may have breathed in anthrax germs, have plague or have been exposed to plague germs.<br/>
      o Children younger than 18 years of age have a higher chance of getting bone, joint, or tendon (musculoskeletal) problems such as pain or swelling while taking ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin should not be used as the first choice of antibacterial medicine in children under 18 years of age.</p><p><span class="Bold">Who should not take ciprofloxacin?</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Do not take ciprofloxacin if you:</span><br/>
   • Have ever had a severe allergic reaction to an antibacterial medicine known as a fluoroquinolone, or are allergic to ciprofloxacin hydrochloride or any of the ingredients in ciprofloxacin. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in ciprofloxacin.<br/>
   • Also take a medicine called tizanidine (Zanaflex<span class="Sup">®</span>).</p><p>Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure.</p><p><span class="Bold">What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking ciprofloxacin?</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> Before you take ciprofloxacin, tell your healthcare provider if you:</span><br/>
   • have tendon problems; ciprofloxacin should not be used in patients who have a history of tendon problems<br/>
   • have a disease that causes muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis); ciprofloxacin should not be used in patients who have a known history of    myasthenia gravis<br/>
   • have liver problems<br/>
   • have central nervous system problems (such as epilepsy)<br/>
   • have nerve problems; ciprofloxacin should not be used in patients who have a history of a nerve problem called peripheral neuropathy<br/>
   • have or anyone in your family has an irregular heartbeat, especially a condition called “QT prolongation”<br/>
   • have or have had seizures<br/>
   • have kidney problems. You may need a lower dose of ciprofloxacin if your kidneys do not work well.<br/>
   • have joint problems including rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<br/>

   • have any other medical conditions<br/>
   • are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if ciprofloxacin will harm your unborn baby.<br/>
   • are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Ciprofloxacin passes into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide whether you will take ciprofloxacin or breastfeed. You should not do both.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take</span>, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.</p><p>Ciprofloxacin and other medicines can affect each other causing side effects.</p><p>Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take:<br/>
   • a steroid medicine<br/>
   • an anti-psychotic medicine<br/>
   • a tricyclic antidepressant<br/>
   • a water pill (diuretic)<br/>
   • theophylline (such as Theo-24<span class="Sup">®</span>, Elixophyllin<span class="Sup">®</span>, Theochron<span class="Sup">®</span>, Uniphyl<span class="Sup">®</span>, Theolair<span class="Sup">®</span>)<br/>

   • clozapine (Clozaril®, Fazaclo® ODT<span class="Sup">®</span>)<br/>
   • a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID). Many common medicines for pain relief are NSAIDs. Taking an NSAID while you take    ciprofloxacin or other fluoroquinolones may increase your risk of central nervous system effects and seizures.<br/>
   • sildenafil (Viagra<span class="Sup">®</span>, Revatio<span class="Sup">®</span>)<br/>
   • duloxetine<br/>
   • products that contain caffeine<br/>

Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.</p><p><span class="Bold">How should I take ciprofloxacin?</span></p><p>   • Take ciprofloxacin exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take it.<br/>
   • Ciprofloxacin is given to you by intravenous (IV) infusion into your vein, slowly, over 60 minutes, as prescribed by your healthcare provider.<br/>
   • Ciprofloxacin can be taken with or without food.<br/>
   • Ciprofloxacin should not be taken with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone, but may be taken with a meal    that contains these products.<br/>
   • Drink plenty of fluids while taking ciprofloxacin.<br/>
   • Do not skip any doses of ciprofloxacin, or stop taking it, even if you begin to feel better, until you finish your prescribed treatment unless:<br/>
      o you have tendon problems. See “<span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about ciprofloxacin?</span>”<br/>
      o you have nerve problems. See "<span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about ciprofloxacin</span>?"<br/>
      o you have central nervous system problems. See "<span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about ciprofloxacin</span>?"<br/>
      o you have a serious allergic reaction. See “<span class="Bold">What are the possible side effects of ciprofloxacin</span>?”<br/>
      o your healthcare provider tells you to stop taking ciprofloxacin.</p><p>Taking all of your ciprofloxacin doses will help make sure that all of the bacteria are killed. Taking all of your ciprofloxacin doses will help lower the chance that the bacteria will become resistant to ciprofloxacin. If you become resistant to ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and other antibacterial medicines may not work for you in the future.<br/>
   • If you take too much ciprofloxacin, call your healthcare provider or get medical help right Away</p><p><span class="Bold">What should I avoid while taking ciprofloxacin?</span><br/>
   • Ciprofloxacin can make you feel dizzy and lightheaded. <span class="Bold">Do not</span> drive, operate machinery, or do other activities that require mental alertness or coordination until you know how ciprofloxacin affects you.<br/>
   • Avoid sunlamps, tanning beds, and try to limit your time in the sun. Ciprofloxacin can make your skin sensitive to the sun (photosensitivity) and the light from sunlamps and tanning beds. You could get a severe sunburn, blisters or swelling of your skin. If you get any of these symptoms while you take ciprofloxacin, call your healthcare provider right away. You should use a sunscreen and wear a hat and clothes that cover your skin if you have to be in sunlight.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are the possible side effects of ciprofloxacin?</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Ciprofloxacin may cause serious side effects, including:</span><br/>
   • See, <span class="Bold">“What is the most important information I should know about ciprofloxacin?”</span><br/>
   • <span class="Bold">Serious allergic reactions</span>. Serious allergic reactions, including death, can happen in people taking fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, even after only 1 dose. Stop taking ciprofloxacin and get emergency medical help right away if you get any of the following symptoms of a severe allergic reaction:<br/>
      o hives<br/>

      o skin rash</p><p>Skin rash may happen in people taking ciprofloxacin, even after only 1 dose. Stop taking ciprofloxacin at the first sign of a skin rash and call your healthcare provider. Skin rash may be a sign of a more serious reaction to ciprofloxacin.</p><p>   • <span class="Bold">Liver damage (hepatotoxicity).</span> Hepatotoxicity can happen in people who take ciprofloxacin. Call your healthcare provider right away if you    have unexplained symptoms such as:</p><p>      o nausea or vomiting                             o unusual tiredness<br/>
      o stomach pain                                      o loss of appetite<br/>

      o abdominal pain or tenderness             o yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes<br/>
      o itching</p><p>Stop taking ciprofloxacin and tell your healthcare provider right away if you have yellowing of your skin or white part of your eyes, or if you have dark urine. These can be signs of a serious reaction to ciprofloxacin (a liver problem). <span class="Bold">Intestine infection (Pseudomembranous colitis).</span> Pseudomembranous colitis can happen with many antibacterial medicines, including ciprofloxacin. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get watery diarrhea, diarrhea that does not go away, or bloody stools. You may have stomach cramps and a fever. Pseudomembranous colitis can happen 2 or more months after you have finished your antibacterial medicine.</p><p>   • <span class="Bold">Serious heart rhythm changes (QT prolongation and torsade de pointes).</span> Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have a change in your heart beat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if you faint. Ciprofloxacin may cause a rare heart problem known as prolongation of the QT interval. This condition can cause an abnormal heartbeat and can be very dangerous. The chances of this event are higher in people:<br/>
      o who are elderly<br/>
      o with a family history of prolonged QT interval<br/>
      o with low blood potassium (hypokalemia)<br/>
      o who take certain medicines to control heart rhythm (antiarrhythmics)</p><p>   • <span class="Bold">Joint Problems.</span> Increased chance of problems with joints and tissues around joints in children under 18 years old can happen.
