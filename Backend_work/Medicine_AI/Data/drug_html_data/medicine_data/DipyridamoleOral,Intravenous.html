It is given only when there is a larger-than-usual chance that these problems may occur. For example, it is given to people who have had diseased heart valves replaced by mechanical valves, because dangerous blood clots are especially likely to occur in these patients. Dipyridamole works by helping to prevent dangerous blood clots from forming.</p><p>Dipyridamole may also be used for other heart and blood conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Dipyridamole is also sometimes used as part of a medical test that shows how well blood is flowing to your heart. For information on this use of dipyridamole, see Dipyridamole—Diagnostic (Systemic).</p><p>Dipyridamole is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using dipyridamole</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For dipyridamole, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to dipyridamole or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Dipyridamole has been tested only in adults and in children older than 12 years of age. There is no specific information comparing use of dipyridamole in children younger than 12 years of age with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Dipyridamole has not been studied specifically in older people taking the medicine regularly to prevent blood clots from forming. Although there is no specific information comparing this use of dipyridamole in the elderly with use in other age groups, it is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking dipyridamole, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using dipyridamole with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>

</ul><p>Using dipyridamole with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Adenosine</li>
<li>Tenecteplase</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of dipyridamole. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Chest pain—The chance of side effects may be increased</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Low blood pressure—Large amounts of dipyridamole can make your condition worse</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of dipyridamole</h2><p>Dipyridamole works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, dipyridamole must be taken in regularly spaced doses, as ordered by your doctor.</p><p>Dipyridamole works best when taken with a full glass (8 ounces) of water at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. However, to lessen stomach upset, your doctor may want you to take the medicine with food or milk.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of dipyridamole will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of dipyridamole. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
<li>For preventing blood clots:
<ul>
<li>For oral dosage form (tablets):
<ul>
<li>Adults—The usual dose is 75 to 100 milligrams (mg) four times a day taken together with an anticoagulant (blood-thinning) medicine.</li>
<li>Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.</li>

Do not double doses.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.</p><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using dipyridamole</h2><p>Dipyridamole is sometimes used together with an anticoagulant (blood thinner) or aspirin. The combination of medicines may provide better protection against the formation of blood clots than any of the medicines used alone. However, the risk of bleeding may also be increased when dipyridamole is taken with aspirin. To reduce the risk of bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>Do not take aspirin, or any combination medicine containing aspirin, unless the same doctor who directed you to take dipyridamole also directs you to take aspirin. This is especially important if you are taking an anticoagulant together with dipyridamole.</li>
<li>If you have been directed to take aspirin together with dipyridamole, take only the amount of aspirin ordered by your doctor . If you need a medicine to relieve pain or a fever, your doctor may not want you to take extra aspirin. It is a good idea to discuss this with your doctor, so that you will know ahead of time what medicine to take.</li>
<li>Your doctor should check your progress at regular visits.</li>
</ul><p>Tell all medical doctors and dentists you go to that you are taking dipyridamole, and whether or not you are taking an anticoagulant (blood thinner) or aspirin together with it.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Dipyridamole side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
