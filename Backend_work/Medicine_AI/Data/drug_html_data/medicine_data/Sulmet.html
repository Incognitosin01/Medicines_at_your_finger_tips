Following administration directions below, this will provide a recommended dose of approximately 61 to 89 mg/lb/day (134 to 196 mg/kg/day) body weight in chickens and 53 to 130 mg/lb/day (117 to 286 mg/kg/day) body weight in turkeys, depending upon the dosage, age and class of chickens or turkeys, ambient temperature, and other factors.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administration: Cattle, Calves and Swine:</span> Add the required dose given above to that amount of water that will be consumed in 1 day; consumption should be carefully checked. Factors such as temperature, humidity and disease will cause variable fluid intake. As a generalization, the above animals will consume approximately 1 gallon per 100 lb body weight per day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Administration: Chickens and Turkeys:</span> Add the required dose given above to that amount of water that will be consumed in 1 day. Water consumption should be carefully checked to insure adequate drug intake. As a generalization, 100 turkeys will drink 1 gallon of water per day for each week of age; chickens will consume one-half this amount.</p><p><span class="Bold">Infectious Coryza (in chickens):</span> Medicate for 2 consecutive days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Acute Fowl Cholera and Pullorum Disease (in chickens):</span> Medicate for 6 consecutive days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Coccidiosis (in chickens and turkeys):</span> Medicate as above for 2 days, then reduce amount of Sulmet Drinking Water Solution to one-half above for 4 additional days.</p><h2>Residue Warnings</h2><p class="First">Do not medicate chickens or turkeys producing eggs for human consumption. To avoid drug residues in edible flesh, withdraw medication from chickens and turkeys ten (10) days prior to slaughter for food.</p><p>Treated cattle must not be slaughtered for at least ten (10) days after the last dose. Exceeding five (5) consecutive days of treatment may cause violative tissue residue to remain beyond the withdrawal time. Do not use in calves under one (1) month of age or calves being fed an all-milk diet. Use in these classes of calves may cause violative residues to remain beyond the withdrawal time. Do not use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older. Use of sulfamethazine in this class of cattle may cause milk residues.</p><p>Withdraw medication from swine fifteen (15) days prior to slaughter for food.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">For best advice in control and treatment of animal disease, consult a veterinarian. Have only medicated water available during treatment, and check carefully to insure adequate Sulmet dosage and water intake. Cattle and calves not drinking or eating must be dosed by drench or with Sulmet Oblets. For best results, treat sick animals individually.</p><p>In poultry, consult a veterinarian or poultry pathologist for diagnosis. For control of outbreaks of disease, medication should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is determined.</p><p>Medicated cattle, swine, chickens and turkeys must actually consume enough medicated water which provides the recommended dosages.</p><p>Sulmet works fast. If symptoms persist after using this preparation for 2 or 3 days, consult a veterinarian. Excessive dosage may cause toxic reactions. Follow above dosage and administration instructions carefully. Hatchability of eggs laid during medication with sulfas and for short periods thereafter, may be adversely affected.</p><p>Treatment of all diseases should be instituted early. Treatment should continue 24 to 48 hours beyond the remission of disease symptoms, but not to exceed a total of 5 consecutive days in cattle or swine.</p><p class="First">Store at or below 25°C (77°F).
