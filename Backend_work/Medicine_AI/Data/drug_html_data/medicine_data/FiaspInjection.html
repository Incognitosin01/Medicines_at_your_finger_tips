</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Fiasp Injection</h2><p class="First">FIASP is indicated to improve glycemic control in adult and pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus.</p><h2>Fiasp Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><h3>Route of Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous Injection:</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion (Insulin Pump):</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Intravenous Administration:</span></p><h3>Dosage Information</h3><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: 100 units of insulin aspart per mL (U-100) is available as a clear and colorless solution in:</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">FIASP is contraindicated</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Never Share a FIASP FlexTouch Pen, PenFill Cartridge or PenFill Cartridge Device Between Patients</h3><p class="First">FIASP FlexTouch disposable pen, PenFill cartridge and PenFill cartridge devices should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using FIASP vials should never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.</p><h3>Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen</h3><p class="First">Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span> or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.3)].</span></p><p>Make any changes to a patient’s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments in concomitant anti-diabetic treatment may be needed.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulin therapies, including FIASP <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g. driving or operating other machinery). FIASP, or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><p>Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>, or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulation. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of FIASP may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia <span class="Italics">[</span>see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First">Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between FIASP and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.</p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">All insulin products, including FIASP, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to potassium concentrations).</p><h3>Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including FIASP <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue FIASP; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. FIASP is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart, or one of the excipients in FIASP <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-Gamma Agonists</h3><p class="First">Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including FIASP, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.</p><h3>Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Pump or infusion set malfunctions can lead to a rapid onset of hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary. Interim therapy with subcutaneous injection of FIASP may be required. Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].</span></span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere:</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 763 adult patients with type 1 diabetes to FIASP in one clinical trial with a mean exposure duration of 25 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.

In the clinical program, generalized hypersensitivity reactions (manifested by generalized skin rash and facial edema) were reported in 0.4% of adult patients treated with FIASP. Allergic skin manifestations reported with FIASP in 1.7% of adult patients from the clinical program include eczema, rash, rash pruritic, urticaria and dermatitis. In Study D, allergic reactions were reported in 4.2% of adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with FIASP.

These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, may require discontinuation of FIASP. In the clinical program, injection site reactions occurred in 1.6% of adult patients treated with FIASP. In Study A, adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with FIASP reported 2.2% injection site reactions. In Study D, infusion site reactions were reported in 10.2% of adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with FIASP.

In Study A, adult patients with type 1 diabetes treated with FIASP gained an average of 0.7 kg and in Study B, adult patients with type 2 diabetes treated with FIASP gained an average of 2.7 kg.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Peripheral Edema</span></span></p><p>Insulin, including FIASP, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previous poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. In the clinical program, peripheral edema occurred in 0.8% of adult patients treated with FIASP.</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other insulin products may be misleading.</p><p>In a 26-week study in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes (Study A <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (</span><span class="Italics">14.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>), among the 763 subjects who received FIASP, 97.2% were positive for cross-reacting anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 90.3% that were positive at baseline. A total of 24.8% of patients who received FIASP were positive for anti-drug (insulin aspart) antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 17.3% that were positive at baseline.</p><p>In a 26-week study in pediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes (Study E <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.3)]</span>), among the 519 subjects who received FIASP, 97.1% were positive for cross-reacting anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 94.6% that were positive at baseline. A total of 19.1% of patients who received FIASP were positive for anti-drug (insulin aspart) antibodies (ADA) at least once during the study, including 16.0% that were positive at baseline.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of insulin aspart. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Table 5 includes clinically significant drug interactions with FIASP.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5.

Available information from published randomized controlled trials with insulin aspart use during the second trimester of pregnancy have not reported an association with insulin aspart and major birth defects or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [<span class="Italics">see Data]</span>. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Considerations]</span>.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, administration of subcutaneous insulin aspart to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at exposures 8- times and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 unit/kg/day, respectively.

However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including a variable duration of treatment and small size of the majority of the trials.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Fertility, embryo-fetal and pre-and postnatal development studies have been performed with insulin aspart and regular human insulin in rats and rabbits. In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, insulin aspart was administered before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy. Further, in a pre- and postnatal development study insulin aspart was given throughout pregnancy and during lactation to rats. In an embryo-fetal development study insulin aspart was given to female rabbits during organogenesis. The effects of insulin aspart did not differ from those observed with subcutaneous regular human insulin. Insulin aspart, like human insulin, caused pre- and post-implantation losses and visceral/skeletal abnormalities in rats at a dose of 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents) and in rabbits at a dose of 10 units/kg/day (approximately three times the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 unit/kg/day, based on human exposure equivalents). No significant effects were observed in rats at a dose of 50 units/kg/day and in rabbits at a dose of 3 units/kg/day. These doses are approximately 8 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 unit/kg/day for rats and equal to the human subcutaneous dose of 1.0 unit/kg/day for rabbits, based on human exposure equivalents. The effects are considered secondary to maternal hypoglycemia.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of FIASP in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effect on milk production. One small published study reported that exogenous insulin, including insulin aspart, was present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of insulin aspart on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of insulin aspart on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for insulin, any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from FIASP or insulin aspart or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of FIASP have been established to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus. Use of FIASP for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 777 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 2 to 17 years, and from studies in adults with diabetes mellitus <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>Pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes treated with mealtime and postmeal FIASP reported a higher rate of blood glucose confirmed hypoglycemic episodes compared to patients treated with NovoLog; the imbalance was greater during the nocturnal period.

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise, may be needed. More severe episodes with coma, seizure or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately.</p><h2>Fiasp Injection Description</h2><p class="First">FIASP (insulin aspart injection) is a rapid-acting insulin analog for subcutaneous or intravenous administration used to lower blood glucose. Insulin aspart is homologous with regular human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28, and is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing <span class="Italics">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span>. Insulin aspart has the empirical formula C<span class="Sub">256</span>H<span class="Sub">381</span>N<span class="Sub">65</span>0<span class="Sub">79</span>S<span class="Sub">6</span> and a molecular weight of 5825.8 daltons.</p><p>FIASP (insulin aspart injection) is an aqueous, sterile, clear and colorless solution. Each mL contains 100 units of insulin aspart and the inactive ingredients: arginine (as L-arginine hydrochloride), USP (3.48 mg); disodium phosphate dihydrate, USP (0.53 mg); glycerol, USP (3.3 mg); metacresol, USP (1.72 mg); niacinamide, USP (20.8 mg); phenol, USP (1.50 mg); zinc (as zinc acetate), USP (19.6 mcg) and water for injection, USP. FIASP has a pH of 7.1. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH.</p><h2>Fiasp Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The primary activity of FIASP is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin aspart, the active ingredient in FIASP, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. Receptor-bound insulin lowers blood glucose by facilitating cellular uptake of glucose into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and by inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The time course of insulin action (i.e., glucose lowering) may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual. The average pharmacodynamic profile [i.e., glucose lowering effect measured as glucose infusion rate (GIR) in a euglycemic clamp study] for subcutaneous administration of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 unit/kg of FIASP in 46 patients with Type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 2 and key characteristics of the timing of the effect are described in Table 6 below.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 6.

At a dose of 200 units/kg/day, insulin aspart increased the incidence of mammary gland tumors in females when compared to untreated controls. The incidence of mammary tumors for insulin aspart was not significantly different than for regular human insulin. The relevance of these findings to humans is not known.</p><p>Insulin aspart was not genotoxic in the following tests: Ames test, mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation test, human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test in mice, and in <span class="Italics">ex vivo</span> UDS test in rat liver hepatocytes.</p><p>In fertility studies in male and female rats, at subcutaneous doses up to 200 units/kg/day (approximately 32 times the human subcutaneous dose, based on units/body surface area), no direct adverse effects on male and female fertility, or general reproductive performance of animals was observed.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Overview of Clinical Studies</h3><p class="First">The efficacy of FIASP was evaluated in 3 randomized, active-controlled trials of 18 to 26 weeks duration in adults and one randomized, active-controlled, treat-to-target trial of 26 weeks duration in pediatric patients.</p><p>In total 1224 adult subjects (N=763 with type 1 diabetes; N=461 with type 2 diabetes) and 519 pediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes were randomized to FIASP.

In adult patients with type 2 diabetes, mealtime FIASP provided non-inferior glycemic control compared to mealtime NovoLog, both in combination with metformin. In addition, mealtime FIASP in a basal-bolus regimen with metformin also provided statistically significant improvement in the overall glycemic control compared to basal insulin therapy alone with metformin in adult patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In adults with type 1 diabetes (N=472), FIASP led to non-inferior glycemic control compared to NovoLog when both were administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump.</p><h3>Type 1 Diabetes - Adults</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Study A (NCT01831765): FIASP added to insulin detemir in adult patients with Type 1 DM inadequately controlled at baseline.</span></p><p>The efficacy of FIASP was evaluated in a 26-week, randomized, active controlled, treat-to-target, multicenter trial in 1143 adult patients with type 1 diabetes inadequately controlled at baseline.
