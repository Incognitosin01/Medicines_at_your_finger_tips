It is used to reduce the body's natural immunity in patients who receive organ (for example, kidney) transplants.</p><p>When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Orthoclone OKT 3</h2><p>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>While you are being treated with muromonab-CD3 and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Muromonab-CD3 may lower your body's resistance. For some immunizations, there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. For other immunizations, it may be especially important to receive the immunization to prevent a disease. In addition, other persons living in your house should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have recently taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.</p><p>Treatment with muromonab-CD3 may also increase the chance of getting other infections. If you can, avoid people with colds or other infections. If you think you are getting a cold or other infection, check with your doctor.</p><p>This medicine commonly causes chest pain, dizziness, fever and chills, shortness of breath, stomach upset, and trembling within a few hours after the first dose. These effects should be less after the second dose. However, check with your doctor or nurse immediately if you have chest pain, rapid or irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath or wheezing, or swelling of the face or throat after any dose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Orthoclone OKT 3 side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
