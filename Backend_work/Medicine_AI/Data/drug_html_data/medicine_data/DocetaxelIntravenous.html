<html><head></head><body><h1>Docetaxel (Intravenous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> docetaxel (doe-se-TAX-el)</p><p>Treatment-related mortality increases with abnormal liver function, at higher doses, and in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based therapy receiving docetaxel at 100 mg/m(2). Avoid use in patients with bilirubin greater than the ULN, or AST or ALT greater than 1.5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase greater than 2.5 x ULN; these patients are at increased risk for developing severe or life-threatening toxicities. Obtain LFTs prior to each treatment cycle. Do not use patients with neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm(3); obtain frequent blood counts to monitor for neutropenia. Severe hypersensitivity, including fatal anaphylaxis, has been reported in patients who received dexamethasone premedication. Severe reactions require immediate docetaxel discontinuation. Use is contraindicated in patients with a severe hypersensitivity to docetaxel or polysorbate 80. Severe fluid retention may occur despite dexamethasone .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It is also used together with other medicines (eg, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin) to treat node-positive breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.</p><p>Docetaxel injection is also used to treat advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who have previously received platinum-based cancer medicines that did not work well. It is also used together with cisplatin to treat advanced or metastatic NSCLC that cannot be removed by surgery in patients who have not received any cancer treatment for lung cancer.</p><p>Docetaxel injection is also used together with prednisone to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (prostate cancer that has spread and is resistant to medical or surgical treatments that lower testosterone).</p><p>Docetaxel injection is also used together with cisplatin and fluorouracil to treat advanced stomach cancer (eg, gastric adenocarcinoma, gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) in patients who have not received cancer treatment for their advanced cancer.</p><p>Docetaxel injection is also used together with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first treatment for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).</p><p>Docetaxel belongs to the group of medicines called antineoplastics (cancer medicines). It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by docetaxel, other unwanted effects will also occur.</p><p>Docetaxel is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using docetaxel</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For docetaxel, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to docetaxel or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of docetaxel injection in children. However, because of docetaxel's alcohol content, it should be used with caution. Recommended doses should not be exceeded and the patient should be carefully monitored during treatment.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of docetaxel injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving docetaxel injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving docetaxel, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using docetaxel with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of docetaxel</h2><p>Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many unwanted effects. Before receiving docetaxel, make sure you understand all the risks and benefits. It is important for you to work closely with your doctor during your treatment.</p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you docetaxel in a medical facility. It is given through a needle placed into one of your veins. The medicine must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 1 hour. The injection is usually given every 3 weeks.</p><p>Docetaxel should come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Your doctor will give you a steroid medicine before each treatment to prevent unwanted effects. Carefully follow the instructions about how to take the steroid. If you forget to take the steroid, tell your doctor <i>before</i> you receive the dose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using docetaxel</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits</i> to make sure docetaxel is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Receiving docetaxel while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. It may also cause birth defects if the father is using it when his sexual partner becomes pregnant. Female patients should use effective birth control during treatment with docetaxel and for 6 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment with docetaxel and for 3 months after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while receiving the medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Docetaxel can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>

Check with your doctor right away if you have fever, severe stomach pain, vomiting, stomach cramps or tenderness, or watery or bloody diarrhea.</p><p>Docetaxel may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, fever or chills, trouble breathing or swallowing, a fast or irregular heartbeat, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat with docetaxel.</p><p>Docetaxel may cause edema or fluid retention, which means your body is keeping too much water. Check with your doctor right away if you have a rapid weight gain, trouble breathing, chest pain or discomfort, extreme tiredness or weakness, irregular breathing, an irregular heartbeat, or excessive swelling of the hands, wrist, ankles, or feet.</p><p>Docetaxel may increase your or your child's risk for other cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), or kidney cancer. Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this.</p><p>Serious skin reactions can occur with docetaxel. Tell your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or a red skin rash on your arms or legs after receiving docetaxel.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have burning, numbness, tingling, or painful sensations in the arms, hands, legs, or feet. These could be symptoms of a condition called peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>Tell your doctor right away if you have vision changes, such as blurred vision, difficulty reading, or eye pain with docetaxel. These could be symptoms of a serious eye problem called cystoid macular edema. Your doctor may want your eyes be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).</p><p>Docetaxel may cause severe lack or loss of strength, which can last a few days up to several weeks. Tell your doctor if you unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Docetaxel contains alcohol and may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or less alert than they are normally. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how docetaxel affects you</i>.</p><p>Talk with your doctor before receiving docetaxel if you plan to have children. Some men who receive docetaxel have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><p>Docetaxel may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease or change in urine amount, joint pain, stiffness, or swelling, lower back, side, or stomach pain, a rapid weight gain, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
