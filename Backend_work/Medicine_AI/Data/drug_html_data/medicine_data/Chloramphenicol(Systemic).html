Frequency not defined.</p><p>Central nervous system: Confusion, delirium, depression, headache</p><p>Dermatologic: Skin rash, urticaria</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, enterocolitis, glossitis, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting</p><p>Hematologic &amp; oncologic: Aplastic anemia, bone marrow depression, granulocytopenia, hypoplastic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypersensitivity reaction</p><p>Ophthalmic: Optic neuritis</p><p>Miscellaneous: Drug toxicity (Gray syndrome), fever</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">ALERT: U.S. Boxed Warning</h2><p>Serious and fatal blood dyscrasias (aplastic anemia, hypoplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and granulocytopenia) are known to occur after the administration of chloramphenicol. In addition, there have been reports of aplastic anemia attributed to chloramphenicol which later terminated in leukemia. Blood dyscrasias have occurred after both short-term and prolonged therapy with this drug. Chloramphenicol must not be used when less potentially dangerous agents will be effective. It must not be used in the treatment of trivial infections or where it is not indicated, as in colds, influenza, infections of the throat; or as a prophylactic agent to prevent bacterial infections.</p><p>It is essential that adequate blood studies be made during treatment with the drug. While blood studies may detect early peripheral blood changes, such as leukopenia, reticulocytopenia, or granulocytopenia, before they become irreversible, such studies cannot be relied on to detect bone marrow depression prior to development of aplastic anemia. To facilitate appropriate studies and observation during therapy, it is desirable that patients be hospitalized.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Blood dyscrasias: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Serious and fatal blood dyscrasias (aplastic anemia, hypoplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and granulocytopenia) have occurred after both short-term and prolonged therapy; do not use for minor infections or when less potentially toxic agents are effective. Monitor CBC frequently in all patients;</b> discontinue if evidence of myelosuppression. Irreversible bone marrow suppression may occur weeks or months after therapy. Avoid prolonged or repeated courses of treatment.</p><p>• Gray syndrome: Characterized by cyanosis, abdominal distention, vasomotor collapse (often with irregular respiration), and death. Reaction appears to be associated with serum levels ≥50 mcg/mL (Powell 1982).</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>C. difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution; reduced dosage and serum concentration monitoring is recommended.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution; reduced dosage and serum concentration monitoring is recommended.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: Use with caution in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.</p><p>• Neonates: Use in premature and full-term neonates and infants has resulted in “gray syndrome" characterized by cyanosis, abdominal distention (with or without emesis), vasomotor collapse (often with irregular respiration), and death; progression of symptoms is rapid; prompt termination of therapy required. Reaction may result from drug accumulation caused by immature hepatic or renal function in neonates and infants.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential (baseline and every 2 days during therapy), periodic hepatic and renal function tests, serum drug concentration</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
C

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Chloramphenicol crosses the placenta producing cord concentrations approaching maternal serum concentrations. An increased risk of teratogenic effects has not been associated with the use of chloramphenicol in pregnancy (Czeizel 2000; Heinonen 1977). "Gray Syndrome" has occurred in premature infants and newborns receiving chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol may be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in pregnant women although caution should be used when administration occurs during the third trimester (CDC [Biggs 2016]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat bacterial infections.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
