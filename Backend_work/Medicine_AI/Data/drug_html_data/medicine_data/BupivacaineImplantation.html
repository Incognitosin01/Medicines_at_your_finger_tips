</ul><p>Chemical Class: Bupivacaine</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for bupivacaine</h2><p>Bupivacaine implant is used to prevent pain for up to 24 hours after surgery in the groin area (open inguinal hernia repair). It is a local anesthetic.</p><p>Bupivacaine causes a loss of feeling and prevents pain by blocking signals at the nerve endings. It does not cause loss of consciousness.</p><p>Bupivacaine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using bupivacaine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For bupivacaine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to bupivacaine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of bupivacaine implant in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of bupivacaine implant in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of bupivacaine than younger adults and are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution for patients receiving bupivacaine implant.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving bupivacaine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using bupivacaine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.
