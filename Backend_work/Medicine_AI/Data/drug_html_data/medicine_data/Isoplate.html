</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Isoplate</h2><p class="First">Isoplate SOLUTION - Platelet Additive Solution [PAS-F] is an isotonic solution to replace a portion of the plasma to store Platelets Pheresis Platelet Additive Solution (PAS) Added Leukocytes Reduced products collected using a hyperconcentrated collection on Terumo BCT's Trima Accel system <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2).]</span></p><p>Platelets Pheresis PAS Added Leukocytes Reduced products are stored in a mix of 65% Isoplate SOLUTION and 35% plasma. Platelets in the solution can be stored at a concentration range of 0.7 to 2.1 × 10<span class="Sup">6</span>/µL for up to 5 days at 20-24 °C with continuous agitation in the Terumo BCT ELP bag [citrated polyvinyl chloride (PVC)] <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14).]</span></p><h2>Isoplate Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">Isoplate SOLUTION is added to hyperconcentrated platelets after the apheresis procedure is complete. It is not intended for direct intravenous infusion.</p><p>Isoplate SOLUTION may only be used with the Trima Accel system for automated blood collection. For instructions on the use of the solution with the Trima Accel system, see the Trima Accel system operator's manual.</p><h3>Administration</h3><ul>
<li><span class="following_xmChange">Ensure solution is the Isoplate SOLUTION and is within the expiration date.</span></li>
<li>Inspect the bag. Do not use if the container is damaged, leaking or if there is any visible sign of deterioration.</li>
<li>Use only if solution is clear and free of particulate matter.</li>
<li>Protect from sharp objects.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Directions for Connecting the Isoplate SOLUTION Bag to the Trima Accel System</span></p><p>At the prompt to connect the platelet additive solution to the Trima Accel system tubing set:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Check for leaks by squeezing the bag. If leaks are found, discard bag.</li>
<li>Ensure the solution is the Isoplate SOLUTION and is within the expiration date.</li>
<li>Inspect the solution in good light. Bags showing cloudiness, haze, or particulate matter should not be used.</li>
</ul><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">500 mL Isoplate SOLUTION - Platelet Additive Solution [PAS-F] is a sterile isotonic solution in a polyolefin bag. Each 100 mL contains: Sodium Chloride 0.53 g; Sodium Gluconate 0.5 g; Sodium Acetate Trihydrate 0.37 g; Potassium Chloride 0.037 g; Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate 0.03 g; Dibasic Sodium Phosphate Dihydrate 0.008 g; Monobasic Potassium Phosphate 0.00082 g; in Water for Injection.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">DO NOT INFUSE Isoplate SOLUTION DIRECTLY TO THE PATIENTS.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><ul>
<li>Verify that the solution bag has been securely attached to the platelet additive solution line on the Trima Accel system tubing set using aseptic technique.</li>
<li>Do not reuse. Discard unused or partially used solution bags.</li>
</ul><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Isoplate SOLUTION is added to platelets after the apheresis procedure is complete. It is not for direct intravenous infusion. It is expected to cause adverse events that are normally associated with platelet transfusion.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">No adverse reactions were reported in the subjects infused with &lt; 10 mL of radiolabeled platelets stored for 5 days in 65% Isoplate SOLUTION, and rinsed prior to infusion <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Studies (14).]</span></p><h2>SPECIAL POPULATIONS</h2><p class="First">Isoplate SOLUTION has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials with specific populations.</p><h2>Isoplate Description</h2><p class="First">Isoplate SOLUTION - Platelet Additive Solution [PAS-F] is an isotonic solution designed to replace a proportion of the plasma used in the storage of Platelet Pheresis, Leukocytes Reduced PAS products collected using a hyperconcentrated collection on Terumo BCT's Trima Accel system.</p><p>The solution is sterile, nonpyrogenic and contains no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agents.</p><p>The formulas of the active ingredients are provided in Table 1.</p><p>Each 100 mL of Isoplate SOLUTION contains: Sodium Chloride USP 0.53 g; Sodium Gluconate USP 0.5 g; Sodium Acetate Trihydrate USP 0.37 g; Potassium Chloride USP 0.037 g; Magnesium Chloride Hexahydrate USP 0.03 g; Dibasic Sodium Phosphate Dihydrate USP 0.008 g; Monobasic Potassium Phosphate NF 0.00082 g; in Water for Injection USP.</p><p>pH may be adjusted with glacial Acetic Acid USP or Sodium Hydroxide NF pH: 7.4 (7.0-7.8).</p><p>Concentration of Electrolytes (mEq/liter): Sodium 141; Potassium 5; Magnesium 3; Chloride 98; Phosphate (HPO=4 ) 1 (0.5 mmole P/liter); Acetate (CH3COO–) 27; Gluconate (HOCH2(CHOH)4COO–) 23.</p><p>The polyolefin bag is not made with natural rubber latex or PVC. Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is present only in sterile dock tube.</p><p>The bag is made from a multilayered film. It contains materials that have been tested to demonstrate the suitability of the container for storing pharmaceutical solutions. The solution contact layer is an elasticized polyolefin. The bag is nontoxic and biologically inert. The bag-solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration. The bag is overwrapped to provide protection from the physical environment and to provide an additional moisture barrier when necessary.</p><h2>Isoplate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Isoplate SOLUTION contains the following key components to maintain platelet function:</p><ul>
<li>Sodium chloride for osmolarity</li>
<li>Acetate to fuel platelet metabolism</li>
<li>Gluconate or phosphate for buffering</li>
<li>Magnesium and potassium to reduce platelet activation<span class="Sup">1,2</span></li>
</ul><p>This solution has no pharmacological effect; the solution provides the appropriate components for platelet function while allowing for a lower volume of plasma in the platelet product during storage.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">In Vivo radiolabeled recovery and survival</span></p><p>A paired study was completed to verify that <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> radiolabeled recovery and survival of hyperconcentrated leukocyte reduced platelets collected by apheresis on the Trima Accel system, diluted in Isoplate SOLUTION, and stored for five days (Test) meet FDA acceptance criteria in comparison with fresh autologous platelets (Control).
