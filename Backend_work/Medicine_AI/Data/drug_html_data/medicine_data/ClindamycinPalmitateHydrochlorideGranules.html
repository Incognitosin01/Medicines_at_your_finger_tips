Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S) Chloro- substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin.</p><p>The structural formula is represented below:</p><p>The chemical name for clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride is Methyl 7-chloro-6, 7, 8-trideoxy-6-(1-methyl-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-4-propyl-L-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamido)-1-thio-L-<span class="Italics">threo</span>-α-D-<span class="Italics">galacto</span> octopyranoside 2- palmitate monohydrochloride.</p><p>Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution Flavored Granules contain clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for reconstitution. Each 5 mL contains the equivalent of 75 mg clindamycin. Inactive ingredients: artificial cherry flavor, dextrin, ethylparaben, poloxamer, simethicone, compressible sugar.</p><h2>Clindamycin Palmitate Hydrochloride Granules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Human Pharmacology</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Blood level studies comparing clindamycin palmitate HCI with clindamycin hydrochloride show that both drugs reach their peak active serum levels at the same time, indicating a rapid hydrolysis of the palmitate to the clindamycin.</p><p>Serum level studies with clindamycin palmitate HCI in normal pediatric patients weighing 50 to 100 lbs given 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg every 6 hours (8, 12 or 16 mg/kg/day) demonstrated mean peak clindamycin serum levels of 1.24, 2.25 and 2.44 mcg/mL respectively, one hour after the first dose. By the fifth dose, the 6-hour serum concentration had reached equilibrium. Peak serum concentrations after this time would be about 2.46, 2.98 and 3.79 mcg/mL with doses of 8, 12 and 16 mg/kg/day, respectively. Serum levels have been uniform and predictable from person to person and dose to dose.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Multiple-dose studies in neonates and infants up to 6 months of age show that the drug does not accumulate in the serum and is excreted rapidly. Serum levels exceed the MICs for most indicated organisms for at least six hours following administration of the usually recommended doses of clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution in adults and pediatric patients.</p><p>Clindamycin is widely distributed in body fluids and tissues (including bones).</p><p>No significant levels of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid, even in the presence of inflamed meninges.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Metabolism</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N- desmethylclindamycin.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Approximately 10% of the bioactivity is excreted in the urine and 3.6% in the feces; the remainder is excreted as bioinactive metabolites.</p><p>The average serum half-life after doses of clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution is approximately two hours in pediatric patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with  Impairment</span></p><p>Serum half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum.</p><p><span class="Italics">Elderly Patients</span></p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4  to 5.1 h) in the elderly compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults; administration of clindamycin palmitate HCl resulted in a similar elimination half- life value of about 4.5 hours in elderly subjects. However, the extent of absorption is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Obese Children</span><br/>
An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese children (2-20 years) demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution normalized by total body weight in obese children are comparable to those in children with normal body weight.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Microbiology</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic.</p><p><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide- inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antimicrobial/Activity</span></p><p>Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitroand in clinical infections, as described in the <span class="Bold">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</span> section.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-positive Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (methicillin-susceptible strains)</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> (penicillin-susceptible strains)</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Anaerobic Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fusobacterium necrophorum</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Fusobacterium nucleatum</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Peptostreptococcus anaerobius</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Prevotella melaninogenica</span></p><p>At least 90% of the microorganisms listed below exhibit in vitrominimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) less than or equal to the clindamycin susceptible MIC breakpoint for organisms of a similar type. However, the efficacy of clindamycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms has not beenestablished in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gram-positive Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> (methicillin-susceptible strains)</p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus agalactiae</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus anginosus</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus mitis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus oralis</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Anaerobic Bacteria</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Actinomyces israelii</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium clostridioforme</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Eggerthella lenta</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Finegoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Prevotella bivia</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Prevotella intermedia</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Testing<br/></span> For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: <span class="Bold">https://www.fda.gov/STIC</span>.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Clindamycin Palmitate Hydrochloride Granules</h2><p class="First">Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution  is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria.</p><p>Clindamycin is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of colitis, as described in the <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNING</span>, before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin).</p><p><span class="Bold">Anaerobes:</span> Serious respiratory tract infections such as empyema, anaerobic pneumonitis and lung abscess; serious skin and soft tissue infections; septicemia; intra-abdominal infections such as peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess (typically resulting from anaerobic organisms resident in the normal gastrointestinal tract); infections of the female pelvis and genital tract such as endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Streptococci:</span> Serious respiratory tract infections; serious skin and soft tissue infections.</p><p><span class="Bold">Staphylococci:</span> Serious respiratory tract infections; serious skin and soft tissue infections.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pneumococci:</span> Serious respiratory tract infections.</p><p>Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.</p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution  and other antibacterial drugs, Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This drug is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">See <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNING.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> Associated Diarrhea</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin Palmitate hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.

Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions</span></p><p>Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS).</span></p><p>Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and</p><p>Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).</p><p>In case of such an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue treatment permanently and institute appropriate therapy.</p><p>A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens.</p><p><span class="Bold">Usage in Meningitis</span>: Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency.</p><p>Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.</p><p>Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.</p><p>The use of Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution occasionally results in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms-particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation.</p><p>Clindamycin dosage modification may not be necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease.</p><p>Prescribing Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution  in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><p><span class="Bold">Information for Patients</span></p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution  should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution  is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution  or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span></p><p>During prolonged therapy, periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.<br/>
Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness.<br/>
<span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4.</p><p><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative.</p><p>Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.6 times the highest recommended adult human oral dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects</span></p><p>In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities.</p><p>Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (3.2 and 1.6 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (1.3 and 0.7 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breastfed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing  mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.<br/>
<br/>
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from<br/>
clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p><p>When clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride for oral solution  is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years), appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></p><p>Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (&gt;60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young subjects (18 to 39 years) and elderly subjects (61 to 79 years) with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following reactions have been reported with the use of clindamycin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and infestations: Clostridium difficile colitis</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> Abdominal pain, pseudomembranous colitis, esophagitis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (see <span class="Bold">BOXED WARNING</span>).
