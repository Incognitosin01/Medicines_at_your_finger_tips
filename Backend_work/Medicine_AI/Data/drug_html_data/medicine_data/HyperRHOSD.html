IVH can lead to clinically compromising anemia and multi-system organ failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal insufficiency, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Alert patients and closely monitor for the signs and symptoms of IVH in a health care setting for at least 8 hours after administration for ITP. Perform a dipstick urinalysis at baseline, 2 hours, 4 hours after administration, and prior to the end of the monitoring period. If signs and/or symptoms of IVH are present or suspected, post-treatment laboratory tests should be performed .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

ITP is a type of blood disorder where the person has a very low number of platelets. Platelets help to clot the blood. Rho(D) immune globulin is also used to prevent antibodies from forming after a person with Rh-negative blood receives a transfusion with Rh-positive blood, or during pregnancy when a mother has Rh-negative blood and the baby is Rh-positive. It belongs to a group of medicines called immunizing agents. Rho(D) immune globulin works to boost the immune system and prevent excessive bleeding.</p><p>The Rh factor is one part of the red blood cell. A person has either Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood. If you receive the opposite type of blood, your body will create antibodies that can destroy the red blood cells. When a pregnant woman is Rh-negative and her baby is Rh-positive, the baby's blood can get into her system and cause her to make antibodies. When the same woman has a second baby with Rh-positive blood, the antibodies will destroy the red blood cells in the baby. Rho(D) immune globulin is given to these women during pregnancy or after delivery to prevent them from making antibodies.</p><p>This medicine is to be administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using HyperRHO S/D</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Rho(D) immune globulin in children. It is not recommended for an infant with Rh-positive blood whose mother is Rh-negative.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Although appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of Rho(D) immune globulin have not been performed in the geriatric population, geriatric-specific problems are not expected to limit the usefulness of Rho(D) immune globulin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart, kidney, or liver problems, and might have conditions that require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving Rho(D) immune globulin.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine.
