</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere.</h2><p class="First">Fluzone<span class="Sup">®</span> Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza A subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine.</p><p>Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere is approved for use in persons 6 months of age and older.</p><h2>Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere. Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For intramuscular use only</span></p><h3>Dose and Schedule</h3><p class="First">The dose and schedule for Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere are presented in Table 1.</p><p>Prior to vaccination, always refer to the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices annual recommendations on prevention and control of influenza.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First">Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and/or discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If any of these defects or conditions exist, Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere should not be administered.</p><p>Before administering a dose of vaccine, shake the prefilled syringe or multi-dose vial. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each dose withdrawn from the multi-dose vial.</p><p>The preferred sites for intramuscular injection are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants 6 months through 11 months of age, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (or the deltoid muscle if muscle mass is adequate) in persons 12 months through 35 months of age, or the deltoid muscle in persons ≥36 months of age. The vaccine should not be injected into the gluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk.</p><p>Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.</p><p>Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere should not be combined through reconstitution or mixed with any other vaccine.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere is a suspension for injection.</p><p>Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere is supplied in 3 presentations:</p><p>1) Prefilled single-dose syringe (pink syringe plunger rod), 0.25 mL, for persons 6 months through 35 months of age.</p><p>2) Prefilled single-dose syringe (clear syringe plunger rod), 0.5 mL, for persons 6 months of age and older.</p><p>3) Multi-dose vial, 5 mL, for persons 6 months of age and older.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not administer Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine <span class="Italics">[see Description (11)]</span>, including egg protein, or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Guillain-Barré Syndrome</h3><p class="First">The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with an elevated risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Evidence for a causal relation of GBS with other influenza vaccines is inconclusive; if an excess risk exists, it is probably slightly more than 1 additional case per 1 million persons vaccinated. (See ref. 1) If GBS has occurred within 6 weeks following previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give Fluzone Quadrivalent should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks.</p><h3>Preventing and Managing Allergic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere.</p><h3>Altered Immunocompetence</h3><p class="First">If Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere is administered to immunocompromised persons, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be obtained.</p><h3>Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness</h3><p class="First">Vaccination with Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere may not protect all recipients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere and Fluzone Quadrivalent are manufactured using the same process. This section summarizes data obtained from clinical studies with Fluzone Quadrivalent.</p><p>In children 6 months through 35 months of age receiving a 0.25-mL dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent in Study 1 (NCT01240746, see http://clinicaltrials.gov), the most common (≥10%) injection-site reactions were pain (57%)1 or tenderness (54%)2, erythema (37%), and swelling (22%); the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were irritability (54%)2, abnormal crying (41%)2, malaise (38%)1, drowsiness (38%)2, appetite loss (32%)2, myalgia (27%)1, vomiting (15%)2, and fever (14%). In children 3 years through 8 years of age, the most common (≥10%) injection-site reactions were pain (67%), erythema (34%), and swelling (25%); the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were myalgia (39%), malaise (32%), and headache (23%). In adults 18 years and older, the most common (≥10%) injection-site reaction was pain (47%); the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were myalgia (24%), headache (16%), and malaise (11%). In adults 65 years of age and older, the most common (≥10%) injection-site reaction was pain (33%); the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were myalgia (18%), headache (13%), and malaise (11%).</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trial(s) of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial(s) of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Children 6 Months Through 8 Years of Age</span></p><p>Study 1 (NCT01240746, see http://clinicaltrials.gov) was a single-blind, randomized, active- controlled multi-center safety and immunogenicity study conducted in the US. In this study, children 6 months through 35 months of age received one or two 0.25 mL doses of either Fluzone Quadrivalent or one of two formulations of a comparator trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV-1 or TIV-2), and children 3 years through 8 years of age received one or two 0.5 mL doses of either Fluzone Quadrivalent, TIV-1, or TIV-2. Each of the trivalent formulations contained an influenza type B virus that corresponded to one of the two type B viruses in Fluzone Quadrivalent (a type B virus of the Victoria lineage or a type B virus of the Yamagata lineage). For participants who received two doses, the doses were administered approximately 4 weeks apart. The safety analysis set included 1841 children 6 months through 35 months of age and 2506 children 3 years through 8 years of age. Among participants 6 months through 8 years of age in the three vaccine groups combined, 49.3% were female (Fluzone Quadrivalent, 49.2%; TIV-1, 49.8%; TIV-2, 49.4%), 58.4% Caucasian (Fluzone Quadrivalent, 58.4%; TIV-1, 58.9%; TIV-2, 57.8%), 20.2% Black (Fluzone Quadrivalent, 20.5%; TIV-1, 19.9%; TIV-2, 19.1%), 14.1% Hispanic (Fluzone Quadrivalent, 14.3%; TIV-1, 13.2%; TIV-2, 14.7%), and 7.3% were of other racial/ethnic groups (Fluzone Quadrivalent, 6.8%; TIV-1, 8.0%; TIV-2, 8.5%). Table 2 and Table 3 summarize solicited injection-site and systemic adverse reactions reported within 7 days post-vaccination via diary cards.

The most commonly reported unsolicited non-serious adverse events were cough, vomiting, and pyrexia. During the 28 days following vaccination, a total of 16 (0.6%) recipients in the Fluzone Quadrivalent group, 4 (0.5%) recipients in the TIV-1 group, and 4 (0.6%) recipients in the TIV-2 group, experienced at least one SAE. Throughout the study period, a total of 41 (1.4%) recipients in the Fluzone Quadrivalent group, 7 (1.0%) recipients in the TIV-1 group, and 14 (1.9%) recipients in the TIV-2 group, experienced at least one SAE. Three SAEs were considered to be possibly related to vaccination: croup in a Fluzone Quadrivalent recipient and 2 episodes of febrile seizure, 1 each in a TIV-1 recipient and a TIV-2 recipient.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">0.5-mL Dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent in Children 6 Months through 35 Months of Age</span></p><p>Study 2 (NCT02915302 see http://clinicaltrials.gov) was a randomized, observer-blinded, 2-arm, multi-center safety and immunogenicity study conducted in the US.

Description</h2><p class="First">Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere (Influenza Vaccine) for intramuscular injection is an inactivated influenza vaccine, prepared from influenza viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. The virus- containing allantoic fluid is harvested and inactivated with formaldehyde. Influenza virus is concentrated and purified in a linear sucrose density gradient solution using a continuous flow centrifuge. The virus is then chemically disrupted using a non-ionic surfactant, octylphenol ethoxylate (Triton<span class="Sup">®</span> X-100), producing a "split virus". The split virus is further purified and then suspended in sodium phosphate-buffered isotonic sodium chloride solution. The Fluzone Quadrivalent process uses an additional concentration factor after the ultrafiltration step in order to obtain a higher hemagglutinin (HA) antigen concentration. Antigens from the four strains included in the vaccine are produced separately and then combined to make the quadrivalent formulation.</p><p>Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere suspension for injection is clear and slightly opalescent in color.</p><p>Antibiotics are not used in the manufacture of Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere.</p><p>The Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere prefilled syringe and vial presentations are not made with natural rubber latex.</p><p>Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere is standardized according to United States Public Health Service requirements and is formulated to contain HA of each of the following four influenza strains recommended for the 2021 Southern Hemisphere influenza season: A/Victoria/2570/2019 IVR-215 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 IVR-208 (H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B Yamagata lineage), and B/Washington/02/2019 (B Victoria lineage). The amounts of HA and other ingredients per dose of vaccine are listed in Table 7. The single-dose, pre-filled syringe (0.25 mL and 0.5 mL) is formulated without thimerosal or any other preservative. The 5 mL multi-dose vial presentation contains thimerosal, a mercury derivative, added as a preservative. Each 0.5 mL dose from the multi-dose vial contains 25 mcg mercury. Each 0.25 mL dose from the multi-dose vial contains 12.5 mcg mercury.</p><h2>Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere. - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Influenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. Since 1977, antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Since 2001, two distinct lineages of influenza B (Victoria and Yamagata lineages) have co-circulated worldwide. Protection from influenza virus infection has not been correlated with a specific level of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer post-vaccination. However, in some human studies, antibody titers ≥1:40 have been associated with protection from influenza illness in up to 50% of subjects. (See ref. 2) (See ref. 3)</p><p>Antibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual change of one or more new strains in each year's influenza vaccine. Therefore, influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the hemagglutinins of influenza virus strains representing the influenza viruses likely to be circulating during the influenza season in the hemisphere for which the vaccine is intended.</p><p>Annual vaccination with the influenza vaccine is recommended because immunity during the year after vaccination declines and because circulating strains of influenza virus change from year to year.</p><h2>NON-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Fluzone Quadrivalent has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of male fertility in animals. Vaccination of female rabbits with Fluzone Quadrivalent revealed no evidence of impaired female fertility <span class="Italics">[see Animal Data (8.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of Fluzone Quadrivalent was demonstrated based on clinical endpoint efficacy data for Fluzone (trivalent influenza vaccine) and on an evaluation of serum HI antibody responses to Fluzone Quadrivalent. Fluzone Quadrivalent, an inactivated influenza vaccine that contains the hemagglutinins of two influenza A subtype viruses and two influenza type B viruses, is manufactured according to the same process as Fluzone.</p><p>Fluzone Quadrivalent Southern Hemisphere and Fluzone Quadrivalent are manufactured using the same process. Data in this section were obtained in studies with Fluzone Quadrivalent.</p><h3>Efficacy of Fluzone (Trivalent Influenza Vaccine) in Children 6 through 24 Months of Age</h3><p class="First">A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at a single US center during the 1999-2000 (Year 1) and 2000-2001 (Year 2) influenza seasons. The intent-to-treat analysis set included a total of 786 children 6 through 24 months of age. Participants received two 0.25 mL doses of either Fluzone (N=525) or a placebo (N=261). Among all randomized participants in both years, the mean age was 13.8 months; 52.5% were male, 50.8% were Caucasian, 42.0% were Black, and 7.2% were of other racial groups. Cases of influenza were identified through active and passive surveillance for influenza-like illness or acute otitis media and confirmed by culture. Influenza-like illness was defined as fever with signs or symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. Vaccine efficacy against all influenza viral types and subtypes was a secondary endpoint and is presented in Table 8.</p><h3>Efficacy of Fluzone (Trivalent Influenza Vaccine) in Adults</h3><p class="First">A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in a single US center during the 2007-2008 influenza season. Participants received one dose of either Fluzone vaccine (N=813), an active comparator (N=814), or placebo (N=325). The intent-to-treat analysis set included 1138 healthy adults who received Fluzone or placebo. Participants were 18 through 49 years of age (mean age was 23.3 years); 63.3% were female, 83.1% were Caucasian, and 16.9% were of other racial/ethnic groups. Cases of influenza were identified through active and passive surveillance and confirmed by cell culture and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p><p>Influenza-like illness was defined as an illness with at least 1 respiratory symptom (cough or nasal congestion) and at least 1 constitutional symptom (fever or feverishness, chills, or body aches).
