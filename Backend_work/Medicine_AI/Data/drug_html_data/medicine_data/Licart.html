However, this medicine does not cure osteoarthritis and will help you only as long as you continue to use it. Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).</p><p>Diclofenac <i>topical 3% gel</i> is also used to treat actinic keratosis, a skin problem that may become cancerous if not treated. The exact way that topical diclofenac helps this condition is unknown.</p><p>Diclofenac <i>topical solution</i> is used to treat pain and swelling caused by osteoarthritis of the knees.</p><p>Diclofenac <i>topical patch</i> and <i>topical system</i> is used to treat acute pain caused by minor strains, sprains, and contusions (bruises).</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><p>This medicine is available without a prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Licart</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of diclofenac <i>topical gel, patch, or solution</i> in children and diclofenac <i>topical system</i> in children younger than 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of diclofenac topical in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, heart, or stomach problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving diclofenac topical.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
