It is used to lower the body's natural immunity in patients who receive kidney transplants.</p><p>When a patient receives a kidney transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted kidney. Basiliximab works by preventing the white blood cells from getting rid of the transplanted kidney. The effect of basiliximab on the white blood cells may also reduce the body's ability to fight infections.</p><p>Basiliximab is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using basiliximab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For basiliximab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to basiliximab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on the use of basiliximab in children have not been completed. Preliminary information on the use of basiliximab in children suggests children have the same side effects from receiving basiliximab as those experienced by adult patients, and basiliximab works as well to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney in children as it does in adult patients.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way as they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of basiliximab in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving basiliximab, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using basiliximab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Echinacea</li>
<li>Tofacitinib</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of basiliximab. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Cancer—Basiliximab may make this condition worse</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Infection—Basiliximab may decrease the body's ability to fight infection</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of basiliximab</h2><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of basiliximab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of basiliximab. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
