The chemical name for methylnaltrexone bromide is (<span class="Italics">R</span>)-<span class="Italics">N</span>-(cyclopropylmethyl) noroxymorphone methobromide. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">21</span>H<span class="Sub">26</span>NO<span class="Sub">4</span>Br, and the molecular weight is 436.36.</p><p>The structural formula is:</p><p>Relistor Tablets for oral administration are film-coated and contain 150 mg of methylnaltrexone bromide (equivalent to 122.5 mg methylnaltrexone). Inactive ingredients are silicified microcrystalline cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, poloxamer 407, stearic acid (vegetable source), colloidal silicon dioxide, edetate calcium disodium, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol and talc.</p><p>RELISTOR for subcutaneous administration is a sterile, clear and colorless to pale yellow aqueous solution. Each 3 mL vial contains 12 mg of methylnaltrexone bromide (equivalent to 9.8 mg of methylnaltrexone) in 0.6 mL of water. The excipients are 3.9 mg sodium chloride USP, 0.24 mg edetate calcium disodium USP, and 0.18 mg glycine hydrochloride. During manufacture, the pH may have been adjusted with hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide.</p><p>Each 8 mg/0.4 mL pre-filled syringe (1 mL syringe) contains 8 mg of methylnaltrexone bromide (equivalent to 6.5 mg of methylnaltrexone) in 0.4 mL of water. The excipients are 2.6 mg sodium chloride USP, 0.16 mg edetate calcium disodium USP, and 0.12 mg glycine hydrochloride.</p><p>Each 12 mg/0.6 mL pre-filled syringe (1 mL syringe) contains 12 mg of methylnaltrexone bromide (equivalent to 9.8 mg of methylnaltrexone) in 0.6 mL of water. The excipients are 3.9 mg sodium chloride USP, 0.24 mg edetate calcium disodium USP, and 0.18 mg glycine hydrochloride.</p><h2>Relistor Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Methylnaltrexone is a selective antagonist of opioid binding at the mu-opioid receptor. As a quaternary amine, the ability of methylnaltrexone to cross the blood-brain barrier is restricted. This allows methylnaltrexone to function as a peripherally-acting mu‑opioid receptor antagonist in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids without impacting opioid-mediated analgesic effects on the central nervous system.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>In a randomized, double-blind placebo- and (open-label) moxifloxacin-controlled 4‑period crossover study, 56 healthy subjects were administered methylnaltrexone bromide 0.3 mg/kg and methylnaltrexone bromide 0.64 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 20 minutes (RELISTOR is not approved for intravenous use), placebo, and a single oral dose of moxifloxacin. At a dose approximately 4.3 times the maximum recommended dose (7.5 times the mean peak plasma concentration for RELISTOR injection and 22 times the peak plasma concentration for Relistor Tablets), methylnaltrexone does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Between the oral dosage range of 150 mg to 450 mg for Relistor Tablets and the subcutaneous dosage range of 0.15 mg/kg to 0.50 mg/kg for RELISTOR injection, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of methylnaltrexone increased in a dose-proportional manner. There was no significant accumulation of methylnaltrexone following once-daily oral dosing of 450 mg Relistor Tablets or subcutaneous dosing of 12 mg RELISTOR injection for seven consecutive days in healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following administration of a single 450 mg dose of Relistor Tablets in OIC patients or healthy subjects, peak concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of methylnaltrexone were observed at approximately 1.5 hours.

Rescue laxatives were prohibited from 4 hours before to 4 hours after taking an injection of study medication.</p><p>Study 4 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study which compared a single, subcutaneous dose of RELISTOR injection 0.15 mg/kg, and RELISTOR injection 0.3 mg/kg versus placebo. The double-blind dose was followed by an open-label 4‑week dosing period, where RELISTOR injection could be used as needed, no more frequently than one dose in a 24-hour period. Throughout both study periods, patients maintained their regular laxative regimen. A total of 154 patients (47 RELISTOR 0.15 mg/kg, 55 RELISTOR 0.3 mg/kg, 52 placebo) were enrolled and treated in the double-blind period. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a rescue-free laxation within 4 hours of the double-blind dose of study medication. RELISTOR-treated patients had a significantly higher rate of laxation within 4 hours of the double-blind dose (62% for 0.15 mg/kg and 58% for 0.3 mg/kg) than did placebo‑treated patients (14%); p &lt; 0.0001 for each dose versus placebo (Figure 1).</p><p>Study 5 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study which compared subcutaneous doses of RELISTOR injection given every other day for 2 weeks versus placebo.

During the first week (Days 1, 3, 5, 7) patients received either 0.15 mg/kg RELISTOR injection or placebo. In the second week the patient's assigned dose could be increased to 0.3 mg/kg if the patient had 2 or fewer rescue-free laxations up to Day 8. At any time, the patient's assigned dose could be reduced based on tolerability. Data from 133 (62 RELISTOR, 71 placebo) patients were analyzed. There were 2 primary endpoints: proportion of patients with a rescue-free laxation within 4 hours of the first dose of study medication and proportion of patients with a rescue-free laxation within 4 hours after at least 2 of the first 4 doses of study medication.
