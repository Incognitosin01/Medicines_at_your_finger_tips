Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or by injection to animals may induce the first stage of parturition if used during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature parturition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits, and rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring. Corticosteroids administered to dogs during pregnancy have also resulted in other congenial anomalies, including deformed forelegs, phocomelia, and anasarca. Keep this product out of reach of children and pets to avoid unintended consumption.<br/></p><h2>Cautions</h2><p class="First">Do not use in the eyes or nose. Not for prolonged use.
