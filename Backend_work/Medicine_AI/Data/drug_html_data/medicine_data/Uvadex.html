You also should have regular eye examinations.</p><p>This medicine increases the sensitivity of your skin to sunlight and also may cause premature aging of the skin. Therefore, exposure to the sun, even through window glass or on a cloudy day, could cause a serious burn. If you must go out during the daylight hours:</p><ul>
<li>After each treatment, cover your skin with protective clothing for at least 24 hours. In addition, use a sun block product that has a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 on those areas of your body that cannot be covered. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.</li>
</ul><p>For 24 hours after your methoxsalen treatment, your eyes should be protected during daylight hours with special wraparound sunglasses that totally block or absorb ultraviolet light (ordinary sunglasses are not adequate). This is to prevent cataracts. Your doctor will tell you what kind of sunglasses to use. These glasses should be worn even in indirect light, such as light coming through a window, or on a cloudy day.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Uvadex side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
