Animal feed bearing or containing this veterinary feed directive drug shall be fed to animals only by or upon a lawful veterinary feed directive issued by a licensed veterinarian in the course of the veterinarian's professional practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Active Drug Ingredient:</span> tilmicosin (as tilmicosin phosphate) 90.7 g per lb (200 g per kg)</p><p class="First">Inert ingredients: ground corncobs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Description:</span> Pulmotil is a formulation of the antibiotic tilmicosin. Tilmicosin is produced semi-synthetically and is in the macrolide class of antibiotics. Each kilogram of Type A Medicated Article contains 200 grams (0.44 lbs) of tilmicosin adsorbed onto ground corncobs.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Indications:</span> For the control of swine respiratory disease associated with <span class="Italics">Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Feeding Directions:</span> Tilmicosin is to be fed continuously at 181 grams to 363 grams per ton (200 ppm to 400 ppm) of Type C medicated feed as the sole ration for a 21-day period, beginning approximately 7 days before an anticipated disease outbreak.</p><p><span class="Bold">IMPORTANT: Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mixing Directions:</span> Thoroughly mix Pulmotil Type A medicated article with feed to provide a Type B medicated feed containing up to 36,300 grams tilmicosin per ton or to provide a complete Type C medicated feed containing 181 to 363 g tilmicosin per ton. Do not use in any feeds containing bentonite. Bentonite in feeds may affect the efficacy of tilmicosin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNINGS:</span> Do not allow horses or other equines access to feeds containing tilmicosin. The safety of tilmicosin has not been established in male swine intended for breeding purposes.</p><p>Feed containing tilmicosin shall not be fed to pigs for more than 21 days during each phase of production without ceasing administration for re-evaluation of antimicrobial use by a licensed veterinarian before re-initiating a further course of therapy with an appropriate antimicrobial. Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) expiration date must not exceed 90 days from the time of issuance. VFDs for tilmicosin phosphate shall not be refilled.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RESIDUE WARNING:</span> Feeds containing tilmicosin must be withdrawn 7 days prior to slaughter.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOT FOR HUMAN USE</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Human Safety Warning:</span> Avoid inhalation, oral exposure, and direct contact with skin or eyes. Operators mixing and handling Pulmotil 90 should use protective clothing, impervious gloves, goggles, and a NIOSH-approved dust mask. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling. If accidental eye contact occurs, immediately rinse thoroughly with water. If irritation persists, seek medical attention. Not for human consumption. Keep out of reach of children.

Lung concentrations of tilmicosin are significantly higher than serum. Following seven consecutive days of administering tilmicosin-medicated feeds to swine, the concentration of tilmicosin in respiratory tissues, phagocytic cells, and nasal secretions was significantly higher than that of plasma or serum. Lung levels are achieved within 2 days after beginning feeding and plateau by 4 days. Using <span class="Italics">in-vitro</span> incubation techniques, the ratio of intracellular to extracellular concentrations of tilmicosin for neutrophils, monocyte-macrophages, and alveolar macrophages were 69, 19, and 17, respectively, after four hours of incubation. Although lower levels of accumulation were observed <span class="Italics">in-vivo</span>, swine alveolar macrophages have been shown <span class="Italics">in-vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in-vivo</span> to concentrate large amounts of tilmicosin; these cells may be important for <span class="Italics">in-vivo</span> distribution of the drug and may serve as an important reservoir for tilmicosin in lung tissue.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Toxicology:</span> The cardiovascular system is the target of toxicity in laboratory and domestic animals given tilmicosin by oral or parenteral routes. Primary cardiac effects are increased heart rate (tachycardia) and decreased contractility (negative inotropy). Given orally, the median lethal dose is 800 mg/kg in fasted rats and 2250 mg/kg in non-fasted rats. No compound-related lesions were found at necropsy. Results of genetic toxicology studies were all negative. Results of teratology and reproduction studies in rats were all negative. The no effect level in dogs after daily oral doses for up to one year is 4 mg/kg of body weight. Tilmicosin was included in the diet of 18 adult horses for a period of 14 days at dose levels of 400, 1200, and 2000 ppm. Some horses at both the low and high dose levels demonstrated gastrointestinal disturbance with more severe colic evident at the higher levels. One horse died after consuming the 2000 ppm diet.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Drug Reactions:</span> No adverse toxicological effects were observed in swine given rations containing 2000 ppm tilmicosin for 42 days and 4000 ppm for 21 days.</p><p>To report adverse effects, access medical information, or obtain additional product information, call 1-800-428-4441.</p><p>Storage Information: Avoid moisture and excessive heat (40°C).</p><p>Not to be used after the date printed on the bag.</p><p><span class="Bold">Restricted Drug (California) - Use Only as Directed<br/>
