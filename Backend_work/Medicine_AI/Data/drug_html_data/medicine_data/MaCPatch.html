</ul><h2>MaC Patch Description</h2><p class="First">MaC Patch (Menthol 5%/Capsaicin 0.0375%) is comprised of an adhesive material containing Menthol and Capsaicin which is applied to a woven polyester backing and covered with a PET film release line. The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 12.5 cm x 8.5cm. Menthol is checmically designated as 2-Isopropyl-5- methylcyclohexanol. It is colourless, hexagonal crystals, usually needle-like; fused masses or crystalline powder with a pleasant, peppermint-like odour. If has a melting point between 31°C to 36° C. Capsaicin is chemically designated as (6E)-N-(4-Hydroxy-3- methoxybenzyl)-8-methyl-6-nonenamide. It is a crystalline white powder. It has a melting point of 65° C.</p><p>Each adhesive patch contains 850 mg of Menthol and 6.375 mg of Capsaicin. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: Water, Glcerin, Sodium Polyacrylate (250000MV), Polysorbate 80, Aloe Vera Leaf, Edetate Disodium, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Iodopropynyl, Butylcarbamate and Propylparaben.</p><p><span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics</span></p><p><br/>
Menthol works by targeting the opiod receptior on the TRPM8 neuron. The TRPM8 neuron is normally activated at temperatures between (8° - 28° C). Menthol causes the neuron to fire at temperatures above normal activation which triggers the characteristic cooling sensation. Also because of menthol's specific targeting of the k-opioid receptor, it is endowed with analgesic properties.  Capsaicin is a naturally occurring compound. Iit is found in chili peppers and is what gives is "heat".  Capsaicin has been found to be effective in reducing inflammation and pain. When Capsaicin enters the body it binds with the protein TRPV1 which is located on pain and heat neurons. When the TRPV1 proton is activated (between 37° - 45° C) it opens the calcium ion channel and give the sensation of pain and heat. When Capsaicin binds to the TRPV1 proton it forces the ion channel to open below its normal activation temperature which is why it gives the distinct heating sensation. It is thought that prolonged activation of these neurons by Capsaicin depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter for pain and heat. the end result appears that the nerves are overwhelmed by the influx and unable to report pain for an extended period of time.</p><h2>INTENDED USE</h2><p class="First">MaC Patch is intended to be used for the temporary relief of minor aches and muscle pains associated with arthritis, simple backache, strains, muscles soreness and stiffness.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">MaC Patch is contraindicated for those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation.</p><h2>MaC Patch Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">MaC Patch contains 0.05% capsaicin and 5.00% menthol.</p><p>Adults and children 12 years and over apply to affected area; change patch 2 to 3 times daily<br/>
