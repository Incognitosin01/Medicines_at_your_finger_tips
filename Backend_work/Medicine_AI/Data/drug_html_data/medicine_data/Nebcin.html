<html><head></head><body><h1>Nebcin (Injection)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> tobramycin (toe-bra-MYE-sin) (Injection route)</p><p>Therapy has been associated with potential neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Patients with impaired renal function, advanced age, dehydration, and those who receive high dosage or prolonged therapy are at an increased risk of toxicity. Monitor renal and auditory function during therapy and discontinue therapy or adjust dose if there is evidence of ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is usually irreversible. Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored periodically to assure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. Concurrent use of other potentially neurotoxic or nephrotoxic agents, or potent diuretics should be avoided. Tobramycin should be used with caution in premature and neonatal infants because of their renal immaturity and the resulting prolongation of serum half-life of the drug. Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
