</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for clascoterone</h2><p>Clascoterone cream is used to treat acne vulgaris.</p><p>Clascoterone is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using clascoterone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For clascoterone, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>The dose of clascoterone will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of clascoterone. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of clascoterone cream in children 12 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy of clascoterone cream have not been established in children younger than 12 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of clascoterone cream in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients using clascoterone.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of clascoterone.
