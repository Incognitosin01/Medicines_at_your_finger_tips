Venetoclax binds to this protein, which helps kill the cancerous lymphocytes in blood and bone marrow.</p><p>Venclexta is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) in adults with or without 17p deletion (a specific genetic marker). Venclexta is sometimes used in combination with rituximab to treat these conditions.</p><p>Venclexta is also used in combination with azacitidine, decitabine, or cytarabine to treat acute myeloid leukemia. This combination is for use in adults who are 75 years or older, or who cannot use standard chemotherapy due to other medical conditions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Tell your doctor about all your current medicines and any you start or stop using.

Chemotherapy is defined as a drug treatment that kills fast-growing cells in your body. Venclexta works by binding to a specific protein called BCL-2 which is overexpressed on cancerous cells in people with cancers such as AML and CLL. By binding to this protein Venclexta kills cancerous CLL and AML lymphocytes, in preference to other fast-growing cells. Continue reading</p><p>Venclexta is usually taken for 12 months by previously untreated patients with CLL or SLL and for 24 months for previously treated patients with CLL or SLL. For patients with AML, Venclexta is taken for as long as it is deemed safe to do so (until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed). Continue reading</p><p>Venclexta (venetoclax) is effective for both CLL and AML with trials reporting significantly more people experiencing complete remission with Venclexta in combination with other treatments compared to standard therapy. Venclexta works quickly as well, with it taking an average of one month for many people to experience a reduction in disease progression. Continue reading</p><p>Venclexta is given once-daily with food in combination with either azacytidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine in adults with AML. It works by binding to a specific protein that is over-expressed in cancerous lymphocytes, killing them. Continue reading</p><p>Although Venclexta is not FDA approved to treat MM, a subgroup analysis of the BELLINI clinical trial, which was halted early by the FDA due to safety concerns, revealed that Venclexta in combination with other treatments may be beneficial for those with relapsed or refractory MM bearing the t(11;14) translocation or with high levels of BCL-2.
