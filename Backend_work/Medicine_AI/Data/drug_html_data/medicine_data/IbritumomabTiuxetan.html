Ibritumomab binding induces apoptosis in B lymphocytes <i>in vitro</i>. It is combined with the chelator tiuxetan, which acts as a specific chelation site for Yttrium-90 (Y-90). The monoclonal antibody acts as a delivery system to direct the radioactive isotope to the targeted cells, however, binding has been observed in lymphoid cells throughout the body and in lymphoid nodules in organs such as the large and small intestines. Beta-emission induces cellular damage through the formation of free radicals (in both target cells and surrounding cells).</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>To lymphoid cells throughout the body and in lymphoid nodules in organs such as the large and small intestines, spleen, testes, and liver</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Has not been characterized; the product of yttrium-90 radioactive decay is zirconium-90 (nonradioactive)</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>A median of 7.2% of the radiolabeled activity was excreted in urine over 7 days</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>B cell recovery begins in ~12 weeks; generally in normal range within 9 months</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Y-90 ibritumomab: 30 hours; Yttrium-90 decays with a physical half-life of 64 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma:</b> Treatment of relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); treatment of previously untreated follicular NHL in patients who achieve a partial or complete response to first-line chemotherapy</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>There are no contraindications listed within the manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><i>Canadian labeling:</i> Known type I hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction to ibritumomab tiuxetan, murine proteins, or any component of the formulation, including yttrium chloride and rituximab; pregnancy; breastfeeding</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Premedicate with oral acetaminophen 650 mg and oral diphenhydramine 50 mg prior to <b>each</b> rituximab infusion.

Discontinue rituximab and Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan infusions in patients experiencing severe cutaneous or mucocutaneous reactions.</p><p>The dose of Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan should not exceed 32 mCi (1,184 MBq).</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Bone marrow suppression: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Delayed, prolonged, and severe cytopenias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) are common. Do not administer to patients with ≥25% lymphoma marrow involvement, patients with impaired bone marrow reserve </b>(eg, prior myeloablative treatment, platelet count &lt;100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, neutrophil count &lt;1,500/mm<sup>3</sup>, hypocellular marrow), or to patients with prior stem cell collection failure. In studies, the median platelet, ANC, and hemoglobin nadir was 49 to 53 days, 61 to 62 days, and 68 to 69 days, respectively. Cytopenias may persist beyond 12 weeks. The median duration of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia was 24 to 35 days and 22 to 29 days respectively, and the median time to platelet and ANC recovery was 13 to 14 days and 12 to 15 days, respectively. Patients with mild baseline thrombocytopenia (100,000 to 149,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) may experience higher incidences of severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Hemorrhage may occur due to thrombocytopenia; avoid concomitant use of medications interfering with coagulation or platelet function. Monitor CBC and platelets weekly until recovery or as clinically indicated. Closely monitor patients for complications of cytopenias (eg, febrile neutropenia, hemorrhage) for up to 3 months after administration.</p><p>• Cutaneous/mucocutaneous reactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Severe cutaneous and mucocutaneous skin reactions have been reported (with fatalities). Discontinue all components of the therapeutic regimen in patients experiencing severe cutaneous or mucocutaneous skin reactions,</b> including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, bullous dermatitis, and exfoliative dermatitis. Onset may occur within days to 4 months following infusion.</p><p>• Extravasation/radiation necrosis: Irritant with vesicant-like properties; avoid extravasation. Infusion site erythema and ulceration have been reported following extravasation; monitor infusion site; promptly terminate infusion with symptoms/signs of extravasation (restart in another limb). There is a case report of (delayed) erythema and ulceration, which is described as radiation necrosis following yttrium-90-ibritumomab extravasation (Williams 2006).</p><p>• Infusion reactions: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Serious fatal infusion reactions may occur with the rituximab component of the therapeutic regimen. Immediately stop infusion and discontinue all components of the therapeutic regimen in patients who develop severe infusion reactions. Fatalities due to rituximab infusion were associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, cardiogenic shock, MI, or ventricular fibrillation; 80% of fatalities occurred with the first rituximab infusion.</b> Administer in a facility with immediate access to resuscitative measures. Infusion reactions typically occur with the first rituximab infusion (onset within 30 to 120 minutes). Other reactions may include hypotension, angioedema, bronchospasm, and urticaria. Less severe reactions may be managed by slowing or temporarily interrupting infusion.</p><p>• Radiation injury: Delayed (up to 1 month) radiation injury has occurred in or near areas of lymphomatous involvement.</p><p>• Secondary malignancies: Malignancies due to the radiation dose from therapeutic exposure may occur. Secondary malignancies (acute myelogenous leukemia and/or myelodysplastic syndrome) have been reported; the median time to secondary malignancy diagnosis following ibritumomab treatment was 1.9 years with a range of 0.4 to 6.3 years (Czuczman 2007).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Albumin: Product contains albumin, which confers a theoretical risk of transmission of viral disease or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</p><p><b><i>Special handling:</i></b></p><p>• Radiopharmaceutical: Use appropriate precautions for handling, disposal, and minimizing exposure to patients and health care personnel. Use only under supervision of individuals with experience/training in the handling of radioactive materials approved by the applicable regulatory authority. The contents of the kit are not radioactive until radiolabeling occurs. During and after radiolabeling, adequate shielding should be used with this product, minimize radiation exposure (to patient and health care professionals) in accordance with institutional radiation safety practices.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Biodistribution: In a postmarketing registry of biodistribution images, biodistribution was altered in a limited number of patients.</p><p>• Experienced professionals: Use should be reserved to physicians and other professionals qualified and experienced in the safe handling of radiopharmaceuticals, and in monitoring and emergency treatment of infusion reactions.</p><p>• Hepatitis B screening: American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) provisional clinical opinion update on hepatitis B virus screening recommendations (Hwang 2015): Patients receiving anti-CD20 antibodies are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. Screen for HBV infection with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) tests prior to treatment initiation; either a total anti-HBc (with both IgG and IgM) or anti-HBc IgG test should be used to screen for chronic or resolved HBV infection (do not use anti-HBc IgM as it may only confirm acute HBV infection). In addition, patients who have risk factors for HBV infection (eg, birthplace in a country with ≥2% HBV prevalence, household or sexual contact with HBV infected patients, high-risk behaviors [eg, IV drug use], and HIV infection) should also be screened prior to beginning therapy. Initiate prophylactic antiviral therapy (utilizing antivirals with low rates of viral resistance) for HBsAg positive/anti-HBc positive patients (without delaying cancer therapy) and continue the antivirals during and for ~6 to 12 months after completing treatment. HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive patients should be monitored for HBV reactivation with HBV DNA and ALT testing approximately every 3 months during treatment; antiviral therapy may be initiated prophylactically or begun promptly at the first sign of HBV reactivation.</p><p>• Immunizations: Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received ibritumomab treatment. The safety of immunization with live vaccines following ibritumomab therapy has not been studied; the ability to generate a response to any vaccine after receiving treatment has not been studied.</p><p>• Maximum dose:<b> [US Boxed Warning]: Do not exceed the Y-90 ibritumomab maximum allowable dose of 32 mCi (1184 MBq).</b> To be used as part of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen (in combination with rituximab).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential and platelet counts weekly until recovery, or as clinically indicated. Platelet count must be obtained prior to day 7, 8, or 9; monitor for cytopenias (and related complications) for up to 3 months after use.</p><p>Hepatitis B virus screening recommendations (ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [Hwang 2015]): Screen for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) tests prior to treatment initiation; either a total anti-HBc (with both IgG and IgM) or anti-HBc IgG test should be used to screen for chronic or resolved HBV infection (do not use anti-HBc IgM as it may only confirm acute HBV infection). HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive patients should be monitored for HBV reactivation with HBV DNA and ALT testing approximately every 3 months during treatment.</p><p>Monitor for signs of active hepatitis B infection (during and for up to 12 months after therapy completion). Monitor for infusion-related allergic reactions (typically within 30 to 120 minutes of administration), for extravasation during ibritumomab infusion; and for severe cutaneous and mucocutaneous reactions.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to therapy. Women of reproductive potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with ibritumomab tiuxetan. Females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during therapy and for at least 12 months following the last dose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Based on the radioactivity, Y-90 ibritumomab may cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy. In addition, ibritumomab tiuxetan is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG<sub>1</sub>). Potential placental transfer of human IgG is dependent upon the IgG subclass and gestational age, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis (Palmeira 2012; Pentsuk 2009).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat a type of lymphoma.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
