<span class="Bold">For topical use only.</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">Not for ophthalmic use.</span></p><p>The Pedi-Dri brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>Pedi-Dri Powder Description</h2><p class="First">PEDI-DRI®, Nystatin Topical Powder USP is for dermatologic use.</p><p>PEDI-DRI® provides, in each gram, 100,000 USP nystatin units dispersed in talc.</p><p>Nystatin is a polyene antifungal antibiotic obtained from <span class="Italics">Streptomyces nursei.</span></p><h2>Pedi-Dri Powder - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Nystatin is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membrane.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Nystatin is an antibiotic which is both fungistatic and fungicidal <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> against a wide variety of yeasts and yeast-like fungi, including <span class="Italics">Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondi, C. pseudotropicalis, C. krusei, Torulopsis glabrata, Tricophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes.</span></p><p>Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of susceptible species resulting in a change in membrane permeability and the subsequent leakage of intracellular components. On repeated subculturing with increasing levels of nystatin, <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> does not develop resistance to nystatin. Generally, resistance to nystatin does not develop during therapy. However, other species of <span class="Italics">Candida (c. tropicalis, C. guilliermondi, C. krusei, and C. stalltoides)</span> become quite resistant on treatment with nystatin and simultaneously become cross resistant to amphotericin as well. This resistance is lost when the antibiotic is removed. Nystatin exhibits no appreciable activity against bacteria, protozoa, or viruses.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Pedi-Dri Powder</h2><p class="First">PEDI-DRI® is indicated in the treatment of cutaneous or mucocutaneous mycotic infections caused by <span class="Italics">Candida albicans</span> and other susceptible <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species.</p><p><span class="Bold">This preparation is not indicated for systemic, oral, intravaginal or ophthalmic use.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">PEDI-DRI® is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to <span class="Bold">any</span> of its components.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nystatin Topical Powder should not be used for the treatment of systemic, oral, intravaginal or ophthalmic infections.</span></p><p>If irritation or sensitization develops, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken as indicated. It is recommended that KOH smears, cultures, or other diagnostic methods be used to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous or mucocutaneous candidiasis and to rule out infection caused by other pathogens.</p><h3>INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT</h3><p class="First">Patients using this medication should receive the following information and instructions:</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">If there is a lack of therapeutic response, KOH smears, cultures, or other diagnostic methods should be repeated.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of nystatin. No studies have been performed to determine the mutagenicity of nystatin or its effects on male or female fertility.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with any nystatin topical preparation. It also is not known whether these preparations can cause fetal harm when used by a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Nystatin topical preparations should be prescribed for a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether nystatin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when nystatin is prescribed for a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness have been established in the pediatric population from birth to 16 years.</p><p>(See <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The frequency of adverse events reported in patients using nystatin topical preparations is less that 0.1%. The more common events that were reported include allergic reactions, burning, itching, rash, eczema, and pain on application (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS: General.)</span></p><h2>Pedi-Dri Powder Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Very moist lesions are best treated with the topical dusting powder.</p><h3>Adults and Pediatric Patients (Neonates and Older)</h3><p class="First">Apply to candidal lesions two or three times daily until healing is complete. For fungal infection of the feet caused by <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species, the powder should be dusted on the feet, as well as, in all foot wear.</p><p>PEDI-DRI® does not stain skin or mucous membranes and provides a simple, convenient means of treatment.</p><h2>How is Pedi-Dri Powder Supplied</h2><p class="First">PEDI-DRI®, Nystatin Topical Powder USP, supplied as 2 oz. of powder in a 6 oz. plastic squeeze bottle.</p><p><span class="Bold">PEDI-DRI®</span> TOPICAL POWDER<br/>
