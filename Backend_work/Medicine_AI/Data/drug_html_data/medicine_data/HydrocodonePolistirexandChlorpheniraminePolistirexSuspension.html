As an opioid, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Drug Abuse and</span><span class="Italics"> Dependence (9</span><span class="Italics">)</span></span>], which can lead to overdose and death [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)</span>]. <span class="Bold">Reserve Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Suspension for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Suspension, prescribe Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Suspension for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals, monitor all patients regularly for the development of addiction or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment.</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17</span>)</span>]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</span></p><h3>5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Hydrocodone produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on the brain stem respiratory center that controls respiratory rhythm and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression includes discontinuation of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists (e.g. naloxone), depending on the patient’s clinical status [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)</span>]. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy, when Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is used concomitantly with other drugs that may cause respiratory depression [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>], in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or decreased respiratory reserve, and in patients with altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance (e.g. elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients) [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is essential [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.1</span>), <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.5</span><span class="Italics">)</span>]. Monitor patients closely, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy or when used in patients at higher risk.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Overdose of hydrocodone in adults has been associated with fatal respiratory depression, and the use of hydrocodone in children younger than 6 years of age has been associated with fatal respiratory depression when used as recommended. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death.</span></p><h3>5.3 Risks of Use in Pediatric Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Children are particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of hydrocodone [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2</span>)</span>]. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4</span>)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in children also exposes them to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</span>], which can lead to overdose and death [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1</span>)</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)</span>]. Because the benefits of symptomatic treatment of cough associated with allergies or thecommon cold do not outweigh the risks of use of hydrocodone in pediatric patients, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirexis not indicated for use in patients younger than 18 years of age [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Indications (1)</span><span class="Italics">,</span> Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</span>].</span></p><h3>5.4 Risks of Use in Other At-Risk Populations</h3><p class="First"><span class="Underline XmChange">Unresponsive Cough</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The dosage of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="Underline XmChange">Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Opioid analgesics and antitussives, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, should not be used in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient’s respiratory function.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or corpulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]<span class="Italics">.</span></span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Underline XmChange">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span>: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>].</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Because of the risk of respiratory depression, avoid the use of opioid antitussives, including Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in patients with compromised respiratory function, patients at risk of respiratory failure, and in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. If Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is prescribed, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex and when Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</span></p><h3>5.5 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death.

Inform patients that household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and such use could lead to overdosage and serious adverse reactions [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)</span>]. For prescriptions where a measuring device is not provided, a pharmacist can provide an appropriate calibrated measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose</span>.</p><h3>5.6 Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine, two of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Advise patients to avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring mental alertness and motor coordination after ingestion of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Avoid concurrent use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants because additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>].</span></p><h3>5.7 Risks from Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Concomitant use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>], particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is achieved.

Respiratory depression has occurred after large initial doses of opioids were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">5.8</span>)].</p><p>Hydrocodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, monitor these patients closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.</p><h3>8.6 Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex has not been characterized in patients with renal impairment. Patients with renal impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal function [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Chlorpheniramine is cleared substantially by the kidney. As such, impaired renal function could potentially lead to the risk of decreased clearance and thereby increased retention or systemic levels of chlorpheniramine. Therefore, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of renal function, and patients should be monitored closely for signs of hydrocodone toxicity (respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension) and chlorpheniramine toxicity.</p><h3>8.7 Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex has not been characterized in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. Chlorpheniramine is extensively metabolized by liver before elimination from the body. As such, impaired hepatic function could potentially lead to the risk of decreased metabolism and thereby increased systemic levels of chlorpheniramine. Therefore, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of hepatic function, and patients should be monitored closely for signs of hydrocodone toxicity (respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension) and chlorpheniramine toxicity.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>9.1 Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex contains hydrocodone bitartrate, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>9.2 Abuse</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex contains hydrocodone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including morphine and codeine. Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic and antitussive products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex</span></p><p>Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is for oral use only.

Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [<span class="Italics">see <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</span></span>].</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>Acute overdose with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory depression (a decrease in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, cyanosis), extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, hypotension, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest, and death.</p><p>Hydrocodone may cause miosis, even in total darkness.

Peripheral toxicity includes hypertension, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, vasodilation, hyperpyrexia, mydriasis, urinary retention, and diminished gastrointestinal motility. Atropine-like signs and symptoms (dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing, tachycardia, hallucinations, gastrointestinal symptoms, convulsions, urinary retention, cardiac arrhythmias and coma) may be observed.</p><p>Impaired secretion from sweat glands following toxic doses of drugs with anticholinergic side effects may predispose to hyperthermia.</p><p>Toxic psychosis, a possible class effect from overdose of sedating antihistamines, has been reported.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>Treatment of overdosage is driven by the overall clinical presentation, and consists of discontinuation of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex together with institution of appropriate therapy. Give primary attention to the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques. Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone and nalmefene, are specific antidotes for respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydrocodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory depression. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex , carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex will continue to release hydrocodone and add to the hydrocodone load for 12 hours or longer following ingestion, necessitating prolonged monitoring. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>Hemodialysis is not routinely used to enhance the elimination of hydrocodone or chlorpheniramine from the body.</p><p>Urinary excretion of chlorpheniramine is increased when the pH of the urine is acidic; however, acid diuresis is NOT recommended to enhance elimination in overdose, as the risks of acidemia and acute tubular necrosis in patients with rhabdomyolysis far outweigh any potential benefits.</p><h2>Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Suspension contains hydrocodone, an opioid agonist; and chlorpheniramine, a histamine-1 (H<span class="Sub">1</span>) receptor antagonist.</p><p> Each 5 mL of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release (ER) Suspension contains hydrocodone polistirex equivalent to 10 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate and chlorpheniramine polistirex equivalent to 8 mg of chlorpheniramine maleate.

The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known; however, hydrocodone is believed to act centrally on the cough center. In excessive doses, hydrocodone will depress respiration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Chlorpheniramine</span></p><p>Chlorpheniramine is a propylamine derivative antihistamine (H<span class="Sub">1</span>-receptor antagonist) of the alkylamine class that also possesses anticholinergic and sedative activity. It prevents released histamine from dilating capillaries and causing edema of the respiratory mucosa.</p><h3>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Hydrocodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.</p><p>Hydrocodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Hydrocodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Hydrocodone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span>]. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span>].</p><p><span class="Italics">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Italics">Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing hydrocodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following multiple dosing with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, hydrocodone mean (S.D.) peak plasma concentrations of 22.8 (5.9) ng/mL occurred at 3.4 hours. Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of hydrocodone.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine mean (S.D.) peak plasma concentrations of 58.4 (14.7) ng/mL occurred at 6.3 hours following multiple dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Although the extent of protein binding of hydrocodone in human plasma has not been definitively determined, structural similarities to related opioid analgesics suggest that hydrocodone is not extensively protein bound.  As most agents in the 5-ring morphinan group of semi-synthetic opioids bind plasma protein to a similar degree (range 19% [hydromorphone] to 45% [oxycodone]), hydrocodone is expected to fall within this range.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine is widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body, including the central nervous system. It reportedly has an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 3.2 L/kg in adults and children and is about 70% bound to plasma proteins. Chlorpheniramine and its metabolites likely cross the placental barrier and are excreted into human breast milk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism, including N-demethylation, O-demethylation, and 6keto reduction to the corresponding 6-α-and 6-β-hydroxy metabolites. CYP3A4 mediated N-demethylation to norhydrocodone is the primary metabolic pathway of hydrocodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O-demethylation to hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is formed from the O-demethylation of hydrocodone and may contribute to the total analgesic effect of hydrocodone. Therefore, the formation of these and related metabolites can, in theory, be affected by other drugs [<span class="Italics">see</span> <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Published in vitro studies have shown that N-demethylation of hydrocodone to form norhydrocodone can be attributed to CYP3A4 while O-demethylation of hydrocodone to hydromorphone is predominantly catalyzed by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by an unknown low affinity CYP enzyme.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine is rapidly and extensively metabolized via demethylation in the liver, forming mono-and didesmethyl derivatives. Oxidative metabolism of chlorpheniramine is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 2D6.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys. The mean plasma half-life of hydrocodone is approximately 4 hours.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine and its metabolites are primarily excreted through the kidneys, with large individual variation. Urinary excretion depends on urine pH and flow rate. The mean plasma half-life of chlorpheniramine is approximately 21 to 24 hours.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and fertility studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex; however, published information is available for the individual active ingredients or related active ingredients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hydrocodone</span></p><p>Carcinogenicity studies were conducted with codeine, an opiate related to hydrocodone.
