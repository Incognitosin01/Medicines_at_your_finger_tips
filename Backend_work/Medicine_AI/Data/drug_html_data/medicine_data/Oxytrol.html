The Oxytrol skin patch delivers the medicine slowly and constantly through your skin and into your bloodstream for the 3 or 4 days that you wear the patch.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Oxytrol if you have uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, a blockage in your stomach or intestines, or if you are unable to completely empty your bladder.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Oxytrol if you are allergic to oxybutynin, or if you have:</p><ul>

Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.</p><p>Do not take by mouth. Oxytrol is for use only on the skin.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Open the sealed pouch and remove the protective liner. Apply the Oxytrol patch to a clean, dry area on your stomach, hip or buttock. Avoid skin that is irritated or damaged, or skin that has been treated with oil or lotion. Avoid placing the patch on a skin area that will be rubbed by a waistband or tight clothing.</p><p>Press the Oxytrol patch firmly into place with your fingers. You may leave the patch on while bathing, showering, or swimming.</p><p>If an Oxytrol patch falls off, try sticking back into place. If it does not stick well, put on a new patch and leave it on only for the rest of your wearing time. Do not change your patch removal schedule.</p><p>Leave the Oxytrol patch in place and wear it for 3 to 4 days. You should change the patch twice per week (such as every Sunday and Thursday). Use a calendar to help you keep a steady patch-changing schedule.</p><p>Choose a different place on your skin to wear the patch each time you put on a new one. Do not use the same skin area twice within 7 days.</p><p><b>Do not wear more than one Oxytrol patch at a time.</b> Using extra skin patches will not make the medicine more effective. Never cut a skin patch.</p><p>Use baby oil or mild soap and water to remove any adhesive residue that stays on your skin. Avoid using harsh soaps, alcohol, nail polish remover, or other solvents that could irritate your skin.</p><p>After removing a patch, fold it in half so it sticks together and throw it away in a place where children or pets cannot get to it.</p><p>The Oxytrol patch may burn your skin if you wear the patch during an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Remove the patch before undergoing such a test.</p><p>Store Oxytrol patches at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep each <b>skin patch</b> in its sealed pouch until you are ready to use it.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you forget to change a skin patch on your scheduled day, replace the patch as soon as you remember. Wear the new patch until your next regular patch-changing day. Do not apply two patches at the same time and do not change your patch-changing schedule.</p><p>If a patch falls off, try sticking back into place. If it does not stick well, put on a new patch and leave it on only for the rest of your wearing time. Do not change your patch removal schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include warmth, tingling, fever, irregular heartbeats, feeling restless, vomiting, and little or no urinating.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Oxytrol?</h2><p>Do not expose the Oxytrol skin patch to sunlight. It should be worn under clothing.</p><p>Drinking alcohol can increase certain side effects of oxybutynin.</p><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how this medicine will affect you. Your reactions could be impaired.</p><p>Avoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise and in hot weather. Oxybutynin can decrease sweating and you may be more prone to heat stroke.</p><p>Avoid getting this medicine in your eyes. If contact does occur, rinse with water.</p><p>Avoid applying lotions, powders, or oils to the skin you plan to treat with Oxytrol. These other skin products can make it harder for your skin to absorb oxybutynin, and it may not work as well.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Oxytrol side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Oxytrol</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Stop using this medicine and call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
