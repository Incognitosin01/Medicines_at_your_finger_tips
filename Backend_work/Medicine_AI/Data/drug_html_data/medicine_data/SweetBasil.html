Basil is an annual herb that grows up to 1 m in height, depending on the climate, with characteristic opposite, light-green, smooth leaves that grow up to 6 cm in width and 11 cm in length. The plant bears small, white flowers arranged in a terminal spike.1, 2 Related plants include Ocimum sanctum (holy basil), Ocimum gratissimum (African basil), Ocimum campechianum (Amazonian basil), and Ocimum canum (hoary basil). A synonym of O. basilicum is Ocimum americanum L.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Traditionally, O. basilicum has been used as an appetite stimulant, carminative, diuretic, and anxiolytic, as well as in cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among other conditions. Medicinal use of basil among ancient Greek and Chinese healers for promoting circulation and treating snake and insect bites has been documented. Sweet basil also has widespread culinary applications.2, 3, 4</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>The major components of the volatile oil of sweet basil are linalool, cineole, and estragole (methyl chavicol), depending on the source.5, 6, 7, 8</p><p>Studies have elucidated the chemical composition of the essential oil and describe terpenic hydrocarbons (eg, cymene, limonene, myrecene, pinene, terpinene, phellandrene), aromatic phenols (carvacrol, eugenol, thymol, and safrol), ketones (menthone, pulegone, carvone and thujone, verbenone, and fenchone), alcohols (eg, borneol, carveol, geraniol, linalool, menthol, terpineol), aliphatic aldehydes (citral, citronellal, and perillaldehyde), acids (citronellic acid and cinnamic acid) and esters (linalyl acetate). However, concentrations of these components vary, depending on the source of the plant.6, 9, 10, 11</p><p>The seeds of the plant contain ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, caffiec acid, vallinin, stigmasterol, apgenin, and luteolin, among other components.5, 10</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Anti-inflammatory activity</h3><p>Limited animal studies report anti-inflammatory activity of O. basilicum essential oil, including reductions in leukocytes in rats and mice with experimentally induced colitis and arthritis, respectively.12, 13 Both the essential oil and the single component estragole showed efficacy in reducing histamine- and arachidonic acid–induced paw edema in mouse models.14 Additionally, in vitro experimental studies suggest that extracts of O. basilicum or its fractions may exert an influence on COX enzyme activity and on prostaglandin and thromboxane production.15, 16</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sweet basil as an antithrombotic or anti-inflammatory agent.</p><h3>Antimicrobial activity</h3><p>In vitro studies report activity of the essential oil against human and plant pathogens.7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23</p><p>Sweet basil essential oil was not active against fluconazole-resistant Candida spp.24</p><p>Laboratory experiments suggest that the oil may be an alternative to common synthetic repellents and/or acaricides, likely due to constituents such as alpha-pinene, limonene, citronellol, citronellal, camphor, and thymol.25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30</p><p>Antiprotozoal activity has also been demonstrated in vitro against Trichomonas vaginalis and Leishmania spp.2, 31</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sweet basil as an antimicrobial agent or as a repellant or acaricide.</p><h3>Antioxidant activity</h3><p>Antioxidant activity has been documented.7, 32, 33, 34, 35 A study in rodents reported improvements in cerebral infarct size, memory impairment, and motor coordination with pre-treatment with O. basilicum extract. Antioxidant activity may contribute to these observed effects.3</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sweet basil as an antioxidant agent.</p><h3>Cardiovascular disease</h3><p>In a study in hypercholesterolemic rodents, O. basilicum extract exerted a vasorelaxant effect.16 In another study in rats, O. basilicum leaf extract demonstrated protection against adverse outcomes of induced myocardial infarction (eg, ST-segment elevation, fibrosis of myocardial tissue), possibly due to its antioxidant effects.36 Additionally, experimental studies in rodents suggest that sweet basil extracts may influence thromboxane production.15, 16</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sweet basil in cardiovascular disease.</p><h3>CNS</h3><p>In limited experiments in mice, extracts of O. basilicum demonstrated antianxiety and sedative effects,37 memory enhancement effects,38 and improvement in neuromuscular coordination.39</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sweet basil in diseases of the CNS.</p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p>Limited in vitro and animal experiments suggest that the observed antidiabetic effects of O. basilicum may be due to alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity.40, 41, 42</p><p>In a study evaluating the toxicity of linalool in poultry, increased serum glucose was observed; however, the researchers considered this effect to have no biological importance.43</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of sweet basil in the management of diabetes.</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>In vitro studies report activity of the essential oil against cancer cell lines, including breast and cervical cancer; however, clinical studies are lacking.7, 44, 45, 46, 47 Based on molecular docking studies performed with proteins from the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, 12 compounds in O. basilicum and other Ocimum spp. potentially have significant mosquito repellent activity.48</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Clinical studies are lacking to provide dosing recommendations for sweet basil.</p><p>Traditionally, doses of 5 to 10 mL of the herb per cup of water or 2.5 to 5 mL of a tincture, taken up to 3 times daily, have been used.4</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Emmenagogue and abortifacient effects have been reported. Avoid amounts larger than are usually found in cooking.49</p><p>Excretion of cineole in breast milk has been documented, but no adverse effects were reported.50</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Case reports are lacking, and the relevance of findings from in vitro and animal studies is unclear. An aqueous extract of dried aerial plant parts inhibited platelet aggregation and reduced thrombin-induced platelet activation.16 An in vitro study reported cytochrome P450 inhibitory activity with sweet basil; however, the clinical relevance has not been established.51 Eugenol was observed to be hepatotoxic in glutathione-depleted mice; caution should be used with concomitant use of acetaminophen.52</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Basil as an herb and sweet basil essential oil both have GRAS status in the United States.53 Clinical studies are lacking regarding associated adverse effects.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Information is limited; basil herb and sweet basil essential oil have GRAS status in the United States.2, 53 Estragole, the major chemical component of sweet basil essential oil, has been associated with hepatocellular tumors in mice and with genotoxicity.2 In poultry administered linalool, serum AST increased, but serum gamma-glutamyl transferase did not.43 Hematological effects (reduced hematocrit, platelets, and red blood cells) have been observed in rats.54</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Ocimum americanum</i> L.</li><li><i>Ocimum campechianum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum canum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum gratissimum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum sanctum</i></li><li>African basil</li><li>Amazonian basil</li><li>Hoary basil</li><li>Holy basil</li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
