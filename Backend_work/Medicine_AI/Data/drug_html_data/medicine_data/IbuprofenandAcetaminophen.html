Ibuprofen may interfere with urine detection of phencyclidine (false-positives) (Marchei 2007), and may lead to false-positive aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) (Funder 2016).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>See individual agents.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Anaphylactoid reactions: Even in patients without prior exposure to ibuprofen, anaphylactoid reactions may occur; patients with "aspirin triad" (bronchial asthma, aspirin intolerance, rhinitis) may be at increased risk. Use of ibuprofen is contraindicated in patients who experience bronchospasm, asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or aspirin therapy.</p><p>• Cardiovascular events: NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious (and potentially fatal) adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, including fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Risk may occur early during treatment and may increase with dose and duration of use. Avoid use in patients with a recent MI unless benefits outweigh risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of cardiovascular events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk (ACC/AHA [Amsterdam 2014]). Avoid use in patients undergoing revascularization procedures. New-onset hypertension or exacerbation of hypertension may occur. NSAIDS may also impair response to antihypertensive agents; monitor BP; use with caution in patients with hypertension. May cause sodium and fluid retention; use with caution in patients with edema. Avoid use in heart failure (ACCF/AHA [Yancy 2013]).</p><p>• CNS effects: May cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and other neurologic effects that may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery, driving).</p><p>• GI events: NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious GI inflammation, ulceration, bleeding, and perforation (may be fatal); elderly patients and patients with history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events. Use with caution in patients on concurrent therapy known to increase the risk of GI bleeding (eg, aspirin, anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids), advanced hepatic disease, coagulopathy, use of alcohol, or in elderly patients. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of GI adverse events. In patients with a history of GI ulcer bleeding requiring NSAID therapy, a COX-2 inhibitor in combination with a proton pump inhibitor is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent bleeding (Barkun 2019). Discontinue use if GI bleeding occurs. Use is contraindicated in patients with active GI bleeding or peptic ulcer. Some product labeling contraindicates use in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation related to NSAID therapy and/or patients with a history of ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, recurrent peptic ulceration, or GI hemorrhage.</p><p>• Hematologic effects: Platelet adhesion and aggregation may be decreased; may prolong bleeding time; patients with coagulation disorders or who are receiving anticoagulants should be monitored closely. Rarely, NSAID use has been associated with potentially severe blood dyscrasias.</p><p>• Hepatotoxicity: Acetaminophen has been associated with acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Hepatotoxicity is usually associated with excessive acetaminophen intake and often involves &gt;1 product that contains acetaminophen. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose (&gt;4 g daily in adults) (Lancaster 2015). Hepatotoxicity has been reported with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen in alcoholic patients. In addition, chronic daily dosing may also result in liver damage in some patients (Bolesta 2002). Rare (sometimes fatal) severe hepatic reactions (eg, fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, hepatic failure) have occurred with NSAID use; discontinue immediately if signs or symptoms of hepatic disease develop or if systemic manifestations occur.</p><p>• Hyperkalemia: NSAID use may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly in the elderly, diabetics, renal disease, and with concomitant use of other agents capable of inducing hyperkalemia (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]-inhibitors). Monitor potassium closely.</p><p>• Infection: May mask signs and symptoms of infection (eg, pain, fever, inflammation) resulting in delayed diagnosis.</p><p>• Ophthalmic events: Ophthalmologic adverse effects have been reported with NSAID use. Discontinue therapy and refer for ophthalmologic evaluation if symptoms occur.</p><p>• Renal effects: NSAID use may compromise existing renal function; dose-dependent decreases in prostaglandin synthesis may result from NSAID use, reducing renal blood flow which may cause renal decompensation (usually reversible). Patients with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, hepatic impairment, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and the elderly are at greater risk of renal toxicity. Rehydrate patient before starting therapy; monitor renal function closely. Long-term NSAID use may result in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.</p><p>• Skin reactions: May cause potentially fatal serious skin adverse events including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; may occur without warning. Discontinue use at first sign of skin rash (or any other hypersensitivity).</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Aseptic meningitis: NSAIDs may increase the risk of aseptic meningitis, especially in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and mixed connective tissue disorders.</p><p>• Asthma: Use with caution in patients with asthma. Use of ibuprofen is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma; severe and potentially fatal bronchospasm may occur.</p><p>• Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Avoid ibuprofen use in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Risk of MI and stroke may be increased with use following CABG surgery.</p><p>• Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Clinical or population-based data regarding the risks of NSAIDs in the setting of COVID-19 are limited (FDA Safety Communication 2020; Kim 2020). Some experts recommend the use of acetaminophen as the preferred antipyretic agent, when possible, and if NSAIDs are needed, to use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration (EMA 2020; Kim 2020). In general, for patients already taking an NSAID for a comorbid condition, it is recommended to continue the NSAID as directed by their health care provider (EMA 2020; NIH 2020; WHO 2020).</p><p>• Ethanol use: Use acetaminophen with caution in patients with alcoholic liver disease; consuming ≥3 alcoholic drinks/day may increase the risk of liver damage. Patients should avoid ethanol or limit to &lt;3 drinks/day.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Elderly: Elderly patients are at increased risk for adverse effects (especially peptic ulceration, CNS effects, renal toxicity) from NSAIDs even at low doses; use with caution.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Self-medication (OTC use): Should not be used with other products containing acetaminophen. Patients should be instructed to contact health care provider if new symptoms occur, if redness or swelling occurs in the painful area, or for pain lasting &gt;10 days. Consuming ≥3 alcoholic beverages/day or taking longer than recommended may increase the risk of GI bleeding.
