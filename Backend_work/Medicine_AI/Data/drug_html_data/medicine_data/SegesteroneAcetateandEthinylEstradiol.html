This risk increases with age, particularly in females &gt;35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, CHCs should not be used by females who are &gt;35 years of age and smoke.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Breast cancer: Use of hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of breast cancer; the absolute risk is small and should be balanced against potential benefits; risk is related to duration of use (Mørch 2017). In females at risk for breast cancer due to family history or susceptibility genes (<i>BRCA1, BRCA2</i>), the use of combination hormonal contraceptives has not been shown to modify the risk for breast cancer. However, breast cancer is a hormonal sensitive tumor and the prognosis for females with a current or recent history of breast cancer may be worse with combination hormonal contraceptive use (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in females with (or history of) breast cancer.</p><p>• Cervical cancer: The use of combination hormonal contraceptives has been associated with a slight increased risk of cervical cancer; however, studies are not consistent and may be related to additional risk factors (Gierisch 2013). Theoretically, use may affect prognosis of existing disease. Females awaiting treatment for cervical cancer may use combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Chloasma: Combination hormonal contraceptives, as well as sun exposure and pregnancy, are triggers for chloasma. Females with a susceptibility to chloasma or additional risk factors should avoid exposure to sun or ultraviolet radiation during therapy (Handel 2014).</p><p>• Cholestasis: Risk of cholestasis may be increased with previous cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or cholestasis with prior oral contraceptive use. Combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered for use in females with a history of pregnancy related cholestasis but should be avoided in patients who have a history of cholestasis with prior oral contraceptive use (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Lipid effects: Combination hormonal contraceptives may adversely affect lipid levels, including serum triglycerides. Females with hypertriglyceridemia or a family history of hypertriglyceridemia may be at increased risk of pancreatitis when using combination hormonal contraceptives. Consider alternative contraception for females with uncontrolled dyslipidemia.</p><p>• Retinal vascular thrombosis: Discontinue if unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions occur and immediately evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis.</p><p>• Thromboembolic disorders: Discontinue use of combination hormonal contraceptives if an arterial or venous thrombotic event occurs. Combination hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of venous thromboembolic events such as DVT and PE (risk is greatest during first year of use and when restarting after a break of ≥4 weeks; risk is less than the risk associated with pregnancy and postpartum); some studies suggest this risk may be higher in preparations with third- or fourth-generation progestins and/or high dose ethinyl estradiol. Females with inherited thrombophilias (eg, protein C or S deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin mutation, antithrombin deficiency) may have increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Age &gt;35 years, hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use also increase the risk of thrombotic events in females taking combination hormonal contraceptives (ASRM 2017; Curtis 2016b; DeSancho 2010; van Vlijmen 2011). Combination hormonal contraceptives may also increase the risk of arterial thrombosis (eg, MI, stroke) and should not be used in females with a history of stroke or ischemic heart disease (Curtis 2016b). Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated in females with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic disease.</p><p>• Toxic shock syndrome: Has been reported following use of vaginal rings and in some cases, concomitant tampon use (causal relationship has not been established).</p><p>• Vaginal bleeding: Breakthrough or intracyclic bleeding and spotting may occur, especially during the first month of therapy. Persistent unscheduled bleeding or breakthrough bleeding following previously regular cycles during therapy warrants further evaluation to rule out malignancy or pregnancy. Amenorrhea may occur during therapy. In addition, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur after discontinuing combination hormonal contraceptives, especially when such a condition was preexistent.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Bariatric surgery:</p><p>– Altered absorption: Consider nonoral contraceptive options in patients who had specific bariatric procedures (Roux-en-Y, biliopancreatic diversion); malabsorptive procedures can potentially decrease absorption of oral contraceptives (Kominiarek 2017; Mechanick 2013; Schlatter 2017). It is difficult to recommend against the use of oral contraceptives in restrictive procedures (sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding) as the evidence is limited (Merki-Feld 2015).</p><p>–­ Venous thromboembolism risk: Consider discontinuation of estrogen-containing medications 30 days prior to bariatric surgery to reduce risk of venous thromboembolism; however, practice may vary based upon institutional protocols (Mechanick 2013).</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Combination hormonal contraceptives may increase the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Prior to use, consider risk factors for cardiovascular disease (age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, smoking status), especially in females &gt;35 years of age; use may be contraindicated.</p><p>• Depression: Use with caution in patients with a history of depression; discontinue if serious depression recurs.</p><p>• Diabetes: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in females with diabetes or prediabetes. In general, use of combination oral contraceptives has limited effects on daily insulin needs and no long-term effects on diabetes control in females with nonvascular disease. However, use in females with concomitant nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, other vascular disease, or diabetes &gt;20 years duration should be evaluated for contraceptive use based on the severity of the condition (Curtis 2016b). Use is contraindicated in females &gt;35 years of age with diabetes mellitus, females with diabetes mellitus &gt;20 years duration, and females with diabetes and vascular disease (including hypertension, retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy).</p><p>• Endometrial or ovarian cancer: The risk of endometrial or ovarian cancer is decreased in females using combination hormonal contraceptives (ACOG 182 2017; Curtis 2016b). Oral contraceptives may be used for contraception if indicated, and to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in females with <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutations (ACOG 182 2017). Females awaiting treatment for endometrial or ovarian cancer may use combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Gallbladder disease: Combination hormonal contraceptives may cause a small increased risk of gallbladder disease or may worsen existing gallbladder disease (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas: Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is associated with hepatic adenomas (rare); rupture may cause fatal intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Long-term use may be associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (rare). Use of this product is contraindicated in females with hepatic tumors.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Combination hormonal contraceptives may be poorly metabolized in females with hepatic impairment. Discontinue if jaundice develops during therapy or if liver function becomes abnormal. Use is contraindicated in females with severe (decompensated) cirrhosis. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered in females with mild (compensated) cirrhosis (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hepatitis: Use is contraindicated in females with acute hepatitis. Continuation of use of combination hormonal contraceptives in females with chronic hepatitis has not been shown to increase the rate or severity of cirrhotic fibrosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Continuation of use in females who are carriers has not been shown to trigger liver failure or severe hepatic dysfunction (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Hereditary angioedema: Estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms in females with hereditary angioedema (Geng 2013; Zuraw 2013).</p><p>• Hypertension: The risk of hypertension may be increased with age, dose, and duration of use. Combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used in females with hypertension and vascular disease, or persistent blood pressure values ≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥100 mm Hg diastolic. The risks of use may not outweigh the benefits of treatment in females with less severe hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg systolic or 90 to 99 mm Hg diastolic) or those with hypertension that is adequately controlled (Curtis 2016a). Other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, older age, smoking, diabetes) should be considered when prescribing contraceptives (Curtis 2016b). The manufacturer contraindicates use in females with uncontrolled hypertension, hypertension with vascular disease, or hypertension and diabetes, and recommends monitoring females with well-controlled hypertension; discontinue therapy if blood pressure rises significantly.</p><p>• Migraine: Evaluate new, recurrent, severe, or persistent headaches. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may be considered in females who have migraines without aura (including menstrual migraines) (Curtis 2016b). Use in females with headaches with focal neurological symptoms, migraine headaches with aura, or migraines in females &gt;35 years of age is contraindicated.</p><p>• Solid organ transplant: Although data is limited, serious medical complications have been reported in females with complicated organ transplants (eg, graft failure, rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy); use of combination hormonal contraceptives is not recommended in females with complicated organ transplants (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): Females with SLE are at an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and VTE. Combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used in females with SLE who have positive (or unknown) antiphospholipid antibodies, due to an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (Curtis 2016b).</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Obese: This product has not been adequately studied in females with a BMI &gt;29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Available evidence suggests efficacy of combination hormonal contraceptives may be decreased in females with a BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; however, reductions in effectiveness are considered minimal and information is conflicting. The risk of VTE may be increased in obese females using combination hormonal contraceptives. In general, the benefits of combination hormonal contraceptives may outweigh the risks in obese females who otherwise are eligible for this method (Curtis 2016b). Clinical studies excluded females with a BMI &gt;29 kg/m<sup>2</sup> after two VTEs occurred in females with a BMI &gt;29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>• Pediatric: Not for use prior to menarche.</p><p>• Postmenopausal females: Use is not indicated in postmenopausal females.</p><p>• Prolonged immobilization: Discontinue during periods of prolonged immobilization. Whenever possible, discontinue at least 4 weeks prior to and for 2 weeks following major surgery or other surgery associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism.</p><p>• Smokers: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: </b><b>Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination hormonal contraceptive use. This risk increases with age, particularly in females &gt;35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination hormonal contraceptives should not be used by females who are &gt;35 years of age and smoke.</b></p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Vaginal ring: Use may not be appropriate in females with conditions that may increase the risk of vaginal irritation or ulceration. Information related to concomitant use with diaphragms, cervical caps, and female condoms is not available. Water-based vaginal creams, suppositories, or lubricants may be used with the vaginal ring; oil-based (including silicone based) vaginal products should not be used. Use is compatible with male condoms made with natural rubber latex, polyisoprene, and polyurethane. Females and their partners may be aware of the vaginal ring during intercourse.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• HIV infection protection: Combination hormonal contraceptives do not protect against HIV infection or other sexually-transmitted diseases (Curtis 2016a; Curtis 2016b).</p><p>• Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins). Estrogens may raise serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. Females on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone while receiving estrogens.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Assessment of pregnancy status (prior to therapy); blood pressure (prior to therapy and yearly); weight (optional; BMI at baseline may be helpful to monitor changes during therapy); assess potential health status changes at routine visits (Curtis 2016a).</p><p>If not used on schedule and one menstrual period is missed, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered. If two consecutive menstrual periods are missed, assess pregnancy status before a new dosing cycle is started.</p><p>Monitor patient for vision changes; signs and symptoms of thromboembolic disorders; signs or symptoms of depression; glycemic control in patients with diabetes; lipid profiles in patients being treated for hyperlipidemias. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling, if indicated, should be performed to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Information related to concomitant use with diaphragms, cervical caps and female condoms is not available. Use is compatible with male condoms made with natural rubber latex, polyisoprene, and polyurethane. Fertility is expected to return within 6 months after discontinuing use.</p><p>Due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) postpartum, combination hormonal contraceptives should not be started in females &lt;4 weeks following delivery who are not breastfeeding. The risk decreases to baseline by postpartum day 42. Use of combination hormonal contraceptives in females between 21 and 42 days after delivery should take into consideration the individual woman's risk factors for VTE (eg, age ≥35 years, previous VTE, thrombophilia, immobility, preeclampsia, transfusion at delivery, cesarean delivery, peripartum cardiomyopathy, BMI, postpartum hemorrhage, or smoking) (Curtis 2016b).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Combination hormonal contraceptives are used to prevent pregnancy; treatment should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs. In general, the use of combination hormonal contraceptives, when inadvertently used early in pregnancy, have not been associated with adverse fetal or maternal effects (Curtis 2016b).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to prevent pregnancy.</p><p>• It may be given to you for other reasons.
