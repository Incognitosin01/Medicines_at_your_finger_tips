This medicine treats only the skin symptoms of CTCL but does not treat lymphoma.</p><p>Uvadex may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not be treated with Uvadex if you are sensitive to light or if you have lens damage in your eye.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with  Uvadex if you are allergic to Uvadex or similar medicines, or if you have:</p><ul>

Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is  Uvadex given?</h2><p>Uvadex is given as part of a procedure called photopheresis (FOE-toe-fe-REE-sis).</p><p>During photopheresis, some of your blood is collected through a small tube (catheter) placed into a vein. The catheter is connected to a machine that separates your white blood cells from other parts of the blood.</p><p>The white blood cells are then mixed with Uvadex and exposed to UVA light. When injected back into your body, these treated blood cells help strengthen your immune system to lessen the skin lesions of CTCL.</p><p>This treatment is usually given for 2 days in a row every 4 weeks for at least 6 months.</p><p><b>Uvadex will make you more sensitive to sunlight, which can cause harmful effects</b> on your vision and on your skin (premature aging or skin cancer).</p><p><b>For at least 24 hours after each photopheresis treatment:</b></p><ul>
<li>
<p>You must protect your skin and eyes from natural sunlight (even sun shining through a window).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not expose your skin to any sunlight. Wear protective clothing including a hat and gloves. Use a sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 30, and apply it to all uncovered skin areas exposed to light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wear sunglasses for at least 24 hours after treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For utmost protection, wear a pair of wraparound UVA-absorbing sunglasses, even while you are indoors near a window.</p>
