Risedronate is in the group of medicines called bisphosphonates (bis FOS fo nayts). It alters the cycle of bone formation and breakdown in the body. Risedronate slows bone loss while increasing bone mass, which may prevent bone fractise.</p><p>Calcium is a mineral that is needed for many functions of the body, especially bone formation and maintenance.</p><p>Actonel is used to treat or prevent postmenopausal and steroid-induced osteoporosis. Actonel is also used to treat Paget's disease of bone.</p><p>Calcium carbonate is used to prevent and to treat calcium deficiencies.</p><p>Actonel with Calcium may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Actonel with Calcium if you have low levels of calcium in your blood (hypocalcemia), or a problem with the movement of muscles in your esophagus.</p><p>Do not take an Actonel tablet if you cannot sit upright or stand for at least 30 minutes.
