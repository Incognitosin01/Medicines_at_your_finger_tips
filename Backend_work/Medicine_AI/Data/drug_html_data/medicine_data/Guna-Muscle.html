The hypersalivation resolves over several hours without further medical treatment.<br/></p><h2>5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First">5.1.    Muscle pain requires differential diagnosis for segmental nerve pain, plantar fasciitis, tendinitis, tendinosis,  deep blood accumulation/hematoma.<br/>
5.2.    Skin cleansing/disinfection is required before application. Saprophytic bacteria may produce injection site abscesses with improper skin preparation.<br/>
5.3.    In rare cases patients may experience hypersalivation within one hour of treatment. Discontinue treatment. The hypersalivation resolves over several hours without further medical treatment.<br/>
5.4.    Patients with known sensitivity to procaine or other local anesthetics should be kept under observation during the therapy.<br/></p><h2>6. ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">6.1    The most common mild adverse reaction is slight reddening at the injection site due to the mechanical effect of the needle or a superficial skin reaction of mild erythema.<br/></p><h2>7. DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><p class="First">7.1.    None Known.<br/></p><h2>8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><p class="First">8.1    <span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span>:  Pregnancy  category  C.

<br/></p><h2>9. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</h2><p class="First">9.1.    No Known.</p><h2>10. OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">10.1.    No Known.<br/></p><h2>11. DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">11.1.    GUNA®-MUSCLE is a sterile solution made with isotonic sodium chloride solution.<br/>
It is a homeopathic complex medicine, whose active ingredients have been selected in order to promote 2 main activities:<br/>
•    Detoxification of the connective tissue matrix<br/>
•    Pain modulation through stimulation of the physiological mechanism of pain control.<br/>
Attenuation of the biological substrates acts to target the area of activity of the product.<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">12.1.    <span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span><br/>
Due to the homeopathic nature of the active ingredients, receptors may be activated by feedback regulation. Beta-endorphins at the 4C dose activate the membrane receptors for endogenous endorphins that play a key role in pain relief.<br/>
12.2.    <span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span><br/>
The physiological effects of GUNA®-MUSCLE are due to the action of the ingredients, as described in the Homeopathic Materia Medica.<br/>
In homeopathy there is no direct relationship between dose and effect, but rather there is a relationship between attenuation and a balancing effect on biochemical pathways.<br/>
In GUNA®-MUSCLE the attenuation of each ingredient has been selected according to the Arndt-Schulz Principle (inverted effect law). The attenuation of the physiological ingredients promotes membrane receptor feedback in order to normalize altered biological pathways. In Addition the attenuation technique activates the low dilutions and stabilizes clinical activity of the compound.<br/>
12.3.    <span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span><br/>
Homeopathic attenuation provides complete bioavailability of the active ingredients.<br/></p><h2>13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><p class="First">13.1.    GUNA®-MUSCLE has no level of toxicity due to the attenuation of the ingredients.<br/>
<br/></p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">14.1    GUNA®-MUSCLE formulation is based on classical Homeopathy and each ingredient has been selected according to its description in the Homeopathic Materia Medica. The product is intended for application to target points such as acupuncture points, Weihe points, and key neurological points.<br/></p><h2>15. REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">15.1.    I.
