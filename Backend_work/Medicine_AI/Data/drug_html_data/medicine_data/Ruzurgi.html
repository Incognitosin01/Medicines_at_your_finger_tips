Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
