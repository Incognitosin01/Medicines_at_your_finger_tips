This medication may contain a preservative that can discolor soft contact lenses. Wait at least 15 minutes after using Xalatan before putting your contact lenses in.</p><p>Xalatan may cause a gradual change in the color of your eyes or eyelids and lashes, as well as increased growth or thickness of your eyelashes. These color changes, usually an increase in brown pigment, occur slowly and you may not notice them for months or years. Color changes may be permanent even after your treatment ends, and may occur only in the eye being treated. This could result in a cosmetic difference in eye or eyelash color from one eye to the other.</p><p>Do not allow the tip of the dropper to touch any surface, including your eyes or hands.
