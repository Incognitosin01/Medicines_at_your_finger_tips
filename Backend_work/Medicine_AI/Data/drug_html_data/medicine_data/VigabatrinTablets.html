Because of this risk and because, when it is effective, vigabatrin provides an observable symptomatic benefit; patient response and continued need for treatment should be periodically assessed.</p><p>Based upon adult studies, 30 percent or more of patients can be affected with bilateral concentric visual field constriction ranging in severity from mild to severe. Severe cases may be characterized by tunnel vision to within 10 degrees of visual fixation, which can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin also can damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Symptoms of vision loss from vigabatrin are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before vision loss is severe. Vision loss of milder severity, while often unrecognized by the patient or caregiver, can still adversely affect function.</p><p>Because assessing vision may be difficult in children, the frequency and extent of vision loss is poorly characterized in these patients. For this reason, the understanding of the risk is primarily based on the adult experience. The possibility that vision loss from vigabatrin may be more common, more severe, or have more severe functional consequences in children than in adults cannot be excluded.</p><p>The onset of vision loss from vigabatrin is unpredictable and can occur within weeks of starting treatment or sooner, or at any time after starting treatment, even after months or years.</p><p>The risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure, but there is no dose or exposure known to be free of risk of vision loss.</p><p>In patients with refractory complex partial seizures, vigabatrin should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 3 months of initiating treatment. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 3 months, treatment should be discontinued at that time <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Vigabatrin should not be used in patients with, or at high risk of, other types of irreversible vision loss unless the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks. The interaction of other types of irreversible vision damage with vision damage from vigabatrin has not been well-characterized, but is likely adverse.</p><p>Vigabatrin should not be used with other drugs associated with serious adverse ophthalmic effects such as retinopathy or glaucoma unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Monitoring of Vision</span></p><p>Monitoring of vision by an ophthalmic professional with expertise in visual field interpretation and the ability to perform dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy of the retina is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. For patients receiving vigabatrin, vision assessment is recommended at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting vigabatrin), at least every 3 months while on therapy, and about 3 to 6 months after the discontinuation of therapy. The diagnostic approach should be individualized for the patient and clinical situation.</p><p>In adults and cooperative pediatric patients, perimetry is recommended, preferably by automated threshold visual field testing. Additional testing may also include electrophysiology (e.g., electroretinography [ERG]), retinal imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography [OCT]), and/or other methods appropriate for the patient. In patients who cannot be tested, treatment may continue according to clinical judgment, with appropriate patient counseling. Because of variability, results from ophthalmic monitoring must be interpreted with caution, and repeat assessment is recommended if results are abnormal or uninterpretable. Repeat assessment in the first few weeks of treatment is recommended to establish if, and to what degree, reproducible results can be obtained, and to guide selection of appropriate ongoing monitoring for the patient.</p><p>The onset and progression of vision loss from vigabatrin is unpredictable, and it may occur or worsen precipitously between assessments. Once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. It is expected that even with frequent monitoring, some vigabatrin patients will develop severe vision loss. Consider drug discontinuation, balancing benefit and risk, if vision loss is documented. It is possible that vision loss can worsen despite discontinuation of vigabatrin.</p><h3>Vigabatrin REMS Program</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin Tablets are available only through a restricted distribution program called the Vigabatrin REMS Program, because of the risk of permanent vision loss.</p><p>Notable requirements of the Vigabatrin REMS Program include the following:</p><ul class="Disk">

In this study, in postmarketing experience, and in published literature reports, these changes generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment. In a few patients, the lesion resolved despite continued use. It has been reported that some infants exhibited coincident motor abnormalities, but no causal relationship has been established and the potential for long-term clinical sequelae has not been adequately studied.</span><br/></p><p>Neurotoxicity (brain histopathology and neurobehavioral abnormalities) was observed in rats exposed to vigabatrin during late gestation and the neonatal and juvenile periods of development, and brain histopathological changes were observed in dogs exposed to vigabatrin during the juvenile period of development. The relationship between these findings and the abnormal MRI findings in infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms is unknown <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.<br/></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The specific pattern of signal changes observed in patients 6 years and younger was not observed in older pediatric and adult patients treated with vigabatrin. In a blinded review of MRI images obtained in prospective clinical trials in patients with refractory complex partial seizures (CPS) 3 years and older (N=656), no difference was observed in anatomic distribution or prevalence of MRI signal changes between vigabatrin-treated and placebo-treated patients. In the postmarketing setting, MRI changes have also been reported in patients 6 years of age and younger being treated for refractory CPS.</span><br/></p><p>For adults treated with vigabatrin, routine MRI surveillance is unnecessary as there is no evidence that vigabatrin causes MRI changes in this population.<br/></p><h3>Neurotoxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Intramyelinic Edema (IME) has been reported in postmortem examination of infants being treated for infantile spasms with vigabatrin.</span></p><p>Abnormal MRI signal changes characterized by increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum have also been observed in some infants treated for IS with vigabatrin. Studies of the effects of vigabatrin on MRI and evoked potentials (EP) in adult epilepsy patients have demonstrated no clear-cut abnormalities <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.<br/></p><p>Vacuolation, characterized by fluid accumulation and separation of the outer layers of myelin, has been observed in brain white matter tracts in adult and juvenile rats and adult mice, dogs, and possibly monkeys following administration of vigabatrin. This lesion, referred to as intramyelinic edema (IME), was seen in animals at doses within the human therapeutic range. A no-effect dose was not established in rodents or dogs. In the rat and dog, vacuolation was reversible following discontinuation of vigabatrin treatment, but, in the rat, pathologic changes consisting of swollen or degenerating axons, mineralization, and gliosis were seen in brain areas in which vacuolation had been previously observed. Vacuolation in adult animals was correlated with alterations in MRI and changes in visual and somatosensory EP.<br/></p><p>Administration of vigabatrin to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development produced vacuolar changes in the brain gray matter (including the thalamus, midbrain, deep cerebellar nuclei, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and forebrain) which are considered distinct from the IME observed in vigabatrin-treated adult animals. Decreased myelination and evidence of oligodendrocyte injury were additional findings in the brains of vigabatrin-treated rats. An increase in apoptosis was seen in some brain regions following vigabatrin exposure during the early postnatal period. Long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) were also observed following vigabatrin treatment of young rats. Administration of vigabatrin to juvenile dogs produced vacuolar changes in the brain gray matter (including the septal nuclei, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum, and globus pallidus). Neurobehavioral effects of vigabatrin were not assessed in the juvenile dog. These effects in young animals occurred at doses lower than those producing neurotoxicity in adult animals and were associated with plasma vigabatrin levels substantially lower than those achieved clinically in infants and children <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)]</span>.<br/></p><p>In a published study, vigabatrin (200, 400 mg/kg/day) induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain of young rats when administered by intraperitoneal injection on postnatal days 5 to 7.<br/></p><p>Administration of vigabatrin to female rats during pregnancy and lactation at doses below those used clinically resulted in hippocampal vacuolation and convulsions in the mature offspring.<br/></p><h3>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</h3><p class="First">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including vigabatrin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</p><p>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive-therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients-treated. There were four suicides in drug treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p><p>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</p><p>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</p><p class="First"> Indication</p><p class="First">Relative Risk:<br/>

Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</p><p>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</p><h3>Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)</h3><p class="First">As with all AEDs, vigabatrin should be withdrawn gradually. However, if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse event, rapid discontinuation can be considered. Patients and caregivers should be told not to suddenly discontinue vigabatrin therapy.</p><p>In controlled clinical studies in adults with complex partial seizures, vigabatrin was tapered by decreasing the daily dose 1,000 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued.</p><p>In a controlled study in pediatric patients with complex partial seizures, vigabatrin was tapered by decreasing the daily dose by one third every week for three weeks.</p><h3>Anemia</h3><p class="First">In North American controlled trials in adults, 6% of patients (16/280) receiving vigabatrin and 2% of patients (3/188) receiving placebo had adverse events of anemia and/or met criteria for potentially clinically important hematology changes involving hemoglobin, hematocrit, and/or RBC indices. Across U.S. controlled trials, there were mean decreases in hemoglobin of about 3% and 0% in vigabatrin and placebo-treated patients, respectively, and a mean decrease in hematocrit of about 1% in vigabatrin-treated patients compared to a mean gain of about 1% in patients treated with placebo.</p><p>In controlled and open-label epilepsy trials in adults and pediatric patients, 3 vigabatrin patients (0.06%, 3/4855) discontinued for anemia and 2 vigabatrin patients experienced unexplained declines in hemoglobin to below 8 g/dL and/or hematocrit below 24%.</p><h3>Somnolence and Fatigue</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin causes somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or operate other complex machinery until they are familiar with the effects of vigabatrin on their ability to perform such activities.</p><p>Pooled data from two vigabatrin controlled trials in adults demonstrated that 24% (54/222) of vigabatrin patients experienced somnolence compared to 10% (14/135) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 28% of vigabatrin patients experienced fatigue compared to 15% (20/135) of placebo patients. Almost 1% of vigabatrin patients discontinued from clinical trials for somnolence and almost 1% discontinued for fatigue.</p><p>Pooled data from three vigabatrin controlled trials in pediatric patients demonstrated that 6% (10/165) of vigabatrin patients experienced somnolence compared to 5% (5/104) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 10% (17/165) of vigabatrin patients experienced fatigue compared to 7% (7/104) of placebo patients. No vigabatrin patients discontinued from clinical trials due to somnolence or fatigue.</p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin causes symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled epilepsy studies, 4.2% (19/457) of vigabatrin patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of vigabatrin-treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestations of peripheral neuropathy in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of numbness or tingling in the toes or feet, signs of reduced distal lower limb vibration or position sensation, or progressive loss of reflexes, starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate peripheral neuropathy systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms was related to duration of vigabatrin treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of peripheral neuropathy were completely reversible upon discontinuation of vigabatrin.</p><h3>Weight Gain</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin causes weight gain in adult and pediatric patients.</p><p>Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in adults found that 17% (77/443) of vigabatrin patients versus 8% (22/275) of placebo patients gained greater than or equal to 7% of baseline body weight. In these same trials, the mean weight change among vigabatrin patients was 3.5 kg compared to 1.6 kg for placebo patients.</p><p>Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with refractory complex partial seizures found that 47% (77/163) of vigabatrin patients versus 19% (19/102) of placebo patients gained greater than or equal to 7% of baseline body weight.</p><p>In all epilepsy trials, 0.6% (31/4855) of vigabatrin patients discontinued for weight gain. The long term effects of vigabatrin related weight gain are not known. Weight gain was not related to the occurrence of edema.</p><h3>Edema</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin causes edema in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess edema, but observed incidence of edema-based pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo.</p><p>Pooled data from controlled trials demonstrated increased risk among vigabatrin patients compared to placebo patients for peripheral edema (vigabatrin 2%, placebo 1%), and edema (vigabatrin 1%, placebo 0%). In these studies, one vigabatrin and no placebo patients discontinued for an edema related AE. In adults, there was no apparent association between edema and cardiovascular adverse events such as hypertension or congestive heart failure.

be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In U.S. and primary non-U.S. clinical studies of 4,079 vigabatrin-treated patients, the most common (greater than or equal to 5%) adverse reactions associated with the use of vigabatrin in combination with other AEDs were headache, somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, convulsion, nasopharyngitis, weight gain, upper respiratory tract infection, visual field defect, depression, tremor, nystagmus, nausea, diarrhea, memory impairment, insomnia, irritability, abnormal coordination, blurred vision, diplopia, vomiting, influenza, pyrexia, and rash.</p><p>The adverse reactions most commonly associated with vigabatrin treatment discontinuation in greater than or equal

In some patients, these enzymes become undetectable. The suppression of ALT and AST activity by vigabatrin may preclude the use of these markers, especially ALT, to detect early hepatic injury.</p><p>Vigabatrin may increase the amount of amino acids in the urine, possibly leading to a false positive test for certain rare genetic metabolic diseases (e.g., alpha aminoadipic aciduria).</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, including vigabatrin, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking vigabatrin during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 or visiting the website, http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This must be done by the patient herself.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of vigabatrin in pregnant women. Limited available data from case reports and cohort studies pertaining to vigabatrin use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, based on animal data, vigabatrin use in pregnant women may result in fetal harm.</p><p>When administered to pregnant animals, vigabatrin produced developmental toxicity, including an increase in fetal malformations and offspring neurobehavioral and neurohistopathological effects, at clinically relevant doses. In addition, developmental neurotoxicity was observed in rats treated with vigabatrin during a period of postnatal development corresponding to the third trimester of human pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Administration of vigabatrin (oral doses of 50 to 200 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis was associated with an increased incidence of malformations (cleft palate) and embryofetal death; these findings were observed in two separate studies. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits (100 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/2 the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 g/day on a body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) basis. In rats, oral administration of vigabatrin (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and increased incidences of fetal anatomic variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development in rats (50 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/5 the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. Oral administration of vigabatrin (50, 100, 150 mg/kg/day) to rats from the latter part of pregnancy through weaning produced long-term neurohistopathological (hippocampal vacuolation) and neurobehavioral (convulsions) abnormalities in the offspring. A no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats was not established; the low-effect dose (50 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/5 the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><p>In a published study, vigabatrin (300 or 450 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to a mutant mouse strain on a single day during organogenesis (day 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12). An increase in fetal malformations (including cleft palate) was observed at both doses.</p><p>Oral administration of vigabatrin (5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day) to young rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development (postnatal days 4 to 65) produced neurobehavioral (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) and neurohistopathological (brain vacuolation, decreased myelination, and retinal dysplasia) abnormalities in treated animals. The early postnatal period in rats is generally thought to correspond to late pregnancy in humans in terms of brain development. The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in juvenile rats (5 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma vigabatrin exposures (AUC) less than 1/30 of those measured in pediatric patients receiving an oral dose of 50 mg/kg.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Vigabatrin is excreted in human milk. The effects of vigabatrin on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from vigabatrin in nursing infants, breastfeeding is not recommended.

The dosing recommendation in this population varies according to age group and is weight-based <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. Adverse reactions in this pediatric population are similar to those observed in the adult population <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Safety and effectiveness as adjunctive treatment of refractory complex partial seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 2 and as monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established.</p><p>Abnormal MRI signal changes and Intramyelinic Edema (IME) in infants and young children being treated with vigabatrin have been observed <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data</span></p><p>Oral administration of vigabatrin (5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day) to young rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development (postnatal days 4 to 65) produced neurobehavioral (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) and neurohistopathological (brain gray matter vacuolation, decreased myelination, and retinal dysplasia) abnormalities. The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in juvenile rats (the lowest dose tested) was associated with plasma vigabatrin exposures (AUC) substantially less than those measured in pediatric patients at recommended doses. In dogs, oral administration of vigabatrin (30 or 100 mg/kg/day) during selected periods of juvenile development (postnatal days 22 to 112) produced neurohistopathological abnormalities (brain gray matter vacuolation). Neurobehavioral effects of vigabatrin were not assessed in the juvenile dog. A no-effect dose for neurohistopathology was not established in juvenile dogs; the lowest effect dose (30 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma vigabatrin exposures lower than those measured in pediatric patients at recommended doses <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of vigabatrin did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger patients.</p><p>Vigabatrin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><p>Oral administration of a single dose of 1.5 g of vigabatrin to elderly (greater than or equal to 65 years) patients with reduced creatinine clearance (less than 50 mL/min) was associated with moderate to severe sedation and confusion in 4 of 5 patients, lasting up to 5 days. The renal clearance of vigabatrin was 36% lower in healthy elderly subjects (greater than or equal to 65 years) than in young healthy males. Adjustment of dose or frequency of administration should be considered. Such patients may respond to a lower maintenance dose <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dose adjustment, including initiating treatment with a lower dose, is necessary in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older and adults with mild (creatinine clearance greater than 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance greater than 30 to 50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance greater than 10 to 30 mL/min) renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin is not a controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin did not produce adverse events or overt behaviors associated with abuse when administered to humans or animals. It is not possible to predict the extent to which a CNS active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of vigabatrin (e.g., incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Following chronic administration of vigabatrin to animals, there were no apparent withdrawal signs upon drug discontinuation. However, as with all AEDs, vigabatrin should be withdrawn gradually to minimize increased seizure frequency <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Signs, Symptoms, and Laboratory Findings of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">Confirmed and/or suspected vigabatrin overdoses have been reported during clinical trials and in postmarketing surveillance. No vigabatrin overdoses resulted in death. When reported, the vigabatrin dose ingested ranged from 3 g to 90 g, but most were between 7.5 g and 30 g. Nearly half the cases involved multiple drug ingestions including carbamazepine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, lamotrigine, valproic acid, acetaminophen, and/or chlorpheniramine.</p><p>Coma, unconsciousness, and/or drowsiness were described in the majority of cases of vigabatrin overdose. Other less commonly reported symptoms included vertigo, psychosis, apnea or respiratory depression, bradycardia, agitation, irritability, confusion, headache, hypotension, abnormal behavior, increased seizure activity, status epilepticus, and speech disorder. These symptoms resolved with supportive care.</p><h3>Management of Overdosage</h3><p class="First">There is no specific antidote for vigabatrin overdose. Standard measures to remove unabsorbed drug should be used, including elimination by emesis or gastric lavage. Supportive measures should be employed, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.</p><p>In an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study, activated charcoal did not significantly adsorb vigabatrin.</p><p>The effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of vigabatrin overdose is unknown. In isolated case reports in renal failure patients receiving therapeutic doses of vigabatrin, hemodialysis reduced vigabatrin plasma concentrations by 40% to 60%.</p><h2>Vigabatrin Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Vigabatrin Tablets, USP are an oral antiepileptic drug and are available as white film-coated 500 mg tablets.</p><p>The chemical name of vigabatrin, USP, a racemate consisting of two enantiomers, is (±) 4-amino-5-hexenoic acid. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">6</span>H<span class="Sub">11</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span> and the molecular weight is 129.16. It has the following structural formula:</p><p>Vigabatrin, USP is a white to almost white powder which is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in methyl alcohol, very slightly soluble in ethyl alcohol and chloroform, and insoluble in toluene and hexane. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution is about 6.9. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient of vigabatrin, USP is about 0.011 (log <span class="Italics">P</span>=-1.96) at physiologic pH. Vigabatrin, USP melts with decomposition in a 3-degree range within the temperature interval of 171°C to 176°C. The dissociation constants (pK<span class="Sub">a</span>) of vigabatrin, USP are 4 and 9.7 at room temperature (25°C).</p><p>Each Vigabatrin Tablet contains 500 mg of vigabatrin, USP. The inactive ingredients are hypromellose 2910, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 8000, polysorbate 80, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, and titanium dioxide.</p><h2>Vigabatrin Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The precise mechanism of vigabatrin's anti-seizure effect is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of its action as an irreversible inhibitor of γ-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. This action results in increased levels of GABA in the central nervous system.</p><p>No direct correlation between plasma concentration and efficacy has been established. The duration of drug effect is presumed to be dependent on the rate of enzyme re-synthesis rather than on the rate of elimination of the drug from the systemic circulation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on Electrocardiogram</span></p><p>There is no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of vigabatrin in single doses up to 6.0 g. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 58 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of vigabatrin (3 g and 6 g) and placebo. Peak concentrations for 6.0 g vigabatrin were approximately 2-fold higher than the peak concentrations following the 3.0 g single oral dose.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin displayed linear pharmacokinetics after administration of single doses ranging from 0.5 g to 4 g, and after administration of repeated doses of 0.5 g and 2.0 g twice daily. Bioequivalence has been established between the oral solution and tablet formulations. The following PK information (T<span class="Sub">max</span>, half-life, and clearance) of vigabatrin was obtained from stand-alone PK studies and population PK analyses.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following oral administration, vigabatrin is essentially completely absorbed. The time to maximum concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) is approximately 1 hour for children and adolescents (3 years to 16 years of age) and adults. There was little accumulation with multiple dosing in adult and pediatric patients. A food effect study involving administration of vigabatrin to healthy volunteers under fasting and fed conditions indicated that the C<span class="Sub">max</span> was decreased by 33%, T<span class="Sub">max</span> was increased to 2 hours, and AUC was unchanged under fed conditions.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Vigabatrin does not bind to plasma proteins. Vigabatrin is widely distributed throughout the body; mean steady-state volume of distribution is 1.1 L/kg (CV = 20%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Elimination</span></p><p>Vigabatrin is not significantly metabolized; it is eliminated primarily through renal excretion. The terminal half-life of vigabatrin is about 6.8 hours for children (3 to 9 years of age), 9.5 hours for children and adolescents (10 to 16 years of age), and 10.5 hours for adults. Following administration of <span class="Sup">[14]</span>C-vigabatrin to healthy male volunteers, about 95% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine over 72 hours with the parent drug representing about 80% of this. Vigabatrin induces CYP2C9, but does not induce other hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Geriatric</span></p><p>The renal clearance of vigabatrin in healthy elderly patients (greater than or equal to 65 years of age) was 36% less than those in healthy younger patients. This finding is confirmed by an analysis of data from a controlled clinical trial <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric</span></p><p>The clearance of vigabatrin is 5.1 L/hr for children (3 to 9 years of age), 5.8 L/hr for children and adolescents (10 to 16 years of age) and 7 L/hr for adults.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gender</span></p><p>No gender differences were observed for the pharmacokinetic parameters of vigabatrin in patients.</p><p><span class="Italics">Race</span></p><p>No specific study was conducted to investigate the effects of race on vigabatrin pharmacokinetics. A cross study comparison between 23 Caucasian and 7 Japanese patients who received 1, 2, and 4 g of vigabatrin indicated that the AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and half-life were similar for the two populations. However, the mean renal clearance of Caucasians (5.2 L/hr) was about 25% higher than the Japanese (4.0 L/hr). Inter-subject variability in renal clearance was 20% in Caucasians and was 30% in Japanese.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Mean AUC increased by 30% and the terminal half-life increased by 55% (8.1 hr vs 12.5 hr) in adult patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr from greater than 50 to 80 mL/min) in comparison to normal subjects.</p><p>Mean AUC increased by two-fold and the terminal half-life increased by two-fold in adult patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr from greater than 30 to 50 mL/min) in comparison to normal subjects.</p><p>Mean AUC increased by 4.5-fold and the terminal half-life increased by 3.5-fold in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr from greater than 10 to 30 mL/min) in comparison to normal subjects.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adult Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Dosage adjustment, including starting at a lower dose, is recommended for adult patients with any degree of renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients 2 Years and Older with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Although information is unavailable on the effects of renal impairment on vigabatrin clearance in pediatric patients 2 years and older, dosing can be calculated based upon adult data and an established formula <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Vigabatrin is not significantly metabolized.

Based on population pharmacokinetics, carbamazepine, clorazepate, primidone, and sodium valproate appear to have no effect on plasma concentrations of vigabatrin <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Alcohol</span></p><p>Co-administration of ethanol (0.6 g/kg) with vigabatrin (1.5 g twice daily) indicated that neither drug influences the pharmacokinetics of the other.</p><p><span class="Italics">Oral Contraceptives</span></p><p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study using a combination oral contraceptive containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel, vigabatrin (3 g/day) did not interfere significantly with the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP3A)-mediated metabolism of the contraceptive tested. Based on this study, vigabatrin is unlikely to affect the efficacy of steroid oral contraceptives. Additionally, no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters (elimination half-life, AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, apparent oral clearance, time to peak, and apparent volume of distribution) of vigabatrin were found after treatment with ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Vigabatrin showed no carcinogenic potential in mouse or rat when given in the diet at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day for 18 months (mouse) or at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day for 2 years (rat).

A total of 357 adults (age 18 to 60 years) with complex partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization were enrolled (Studies 1 and 2). Patients were required to be on an adequate and stable dose of an anticonvulsant, and have a history of failure on an adequate regimen of carbamazepine or phenytoin. Patients had a history of about 8 seizures per month (median) for about 20 years (median) prior to entrance into the study. These studies were not capable by design of demonstrating direct superiority of vigabatrin over any other anticonvulsant added to a regimen to which the patient had not adequately responded. Further, in these studies, patients had previously been treated with a limited range of anticonvulsants.</p><p>The primary measure of efficacy was the patient’s reduction in mean monthly frequency of complex partial seizures plus partial seizures secondarily generalized at end of study compared to baseline.</p><p><span class="Italics">Study 1</span></p><p>Study 1 (N=174) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study consisting of an 8-week baseline period followed by an 18-week treatment period.
