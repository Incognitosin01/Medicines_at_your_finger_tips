It belongs to a group of medicines called vasodilators that can increase blood flow by expanding blood vessels. This medicine causes an erection because it increases the blood flow to the penis.</p><p>Alprostadil should not be used as a sexual aid by men who do not have erectile dysfunction.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Muse</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain alprostadil.  It may not be specific to Muse. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often or longer than your doctor ordered.</p><p>This medicine comes with patient directions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>This medicine usually begins to work in about 5 to 10 minutes. You should attempt intercourse within 10 to 30 minutes after using the medicine. An erection may continue after ejaculation.</p><p>To use:</p><ul>
<li>Before inserting a suppository, you should urinate. The small amount of urine normally left in your urethra will help dissolve the suppository after it is inserted.</li>
<li>Remove the delivery device containing the suppository from the foil. Remove the cap from the applicator stem.</li>
<li>Stretch your penis upward to extend its length, pressing your penis top and bottom. Gently insert the delivery stem up to its collar into your urethra (located at the top of the penis). If you have pain or a pulling feeling in the penis, withdraw the device and start again.</li>
<li>Press the button down slowly as far as it will go. This releases the suppository into the urethra. After holding the delivery device within your penis still for 5 seconds, carefully rock the penis and delivery device as a unit from side to side. This helps remove the suppository from the device.</li>
<li>Remove the delivery device while your penis is upright. Look at the device to make sure that the suppository was completely released.</li>
<li>Repeat the process if a part of the suppository remains in the device.</li>
<li>After the suppository is completely released, roll your penis between your hands for 10 seconds. This helps to dissolve the suppository. If you feel any stinging, continue this motion to help stop it.</li>
<li>Sitting, standing, or walking for 10 minutes while an erection is developing helps increase the blood flow to your penis to gain a proper erection.</li>
<li>Replace the cap on the delivery device. After storing it in the foil, fold and throw away.</li>
