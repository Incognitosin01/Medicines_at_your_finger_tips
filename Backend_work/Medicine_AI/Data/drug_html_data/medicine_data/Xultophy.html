Insulin degludec is a long-acting insulin that starts to work several hours after injection and keeps working evenly for 24 hours.</p><p>Liraglutide is similar to a hormone that occurs naturally in the body and helps control blood sugar, insulin levels, and digestion.</p><p>Xultophy is used to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This medicine should be used together with diet and exercise.</p><p>Xultophy is usually given when your blood sugar levels have not been well controlled by using other medications.</p><p>Xultophy is not for people with type 1 diabetes.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Xultophy if you have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (tumors in your glands), a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer, insulin-dependent diabetes, or if you are having an episode of low blood sugar or diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p>In animal studies, liraglutide caused thyroid tumors or thyroid cancer.

Do not dilute or mix other medicines in the injection with Xultophy.</p><p>You may use Xultophy with or without food.</p><p>Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject this medicine.

To quickly treat hypoglycemia, eat or drink a fast-acting source of sugar (fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda).</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe a glucagon injection kit in case you have severe hypoglycemia. Be sure your family or close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>Never share an Xultophy injection pen with another person, even if the needle has been changed. Sharing these devices can allow infections or disease to pass from one person to another.</p><p>Keep Xultophy in its original container protected from heat and light.
