Xartemis XR exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing Xartemis XR, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</span><br/>
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Xartemis XR. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Xartemis XR or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow Xartemis XR tablets whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving Xartemis XR can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Accidental Ingestion</span><br/>
Accidental ingestion of Xartemis XR, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</span><br/>
Prolonged use of Xartemis XR during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction</span><br/>
The concomitant use of Xartemis XR with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving Xartemis XR and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or <span class="Italics">inducer</span> <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="following_xmChange"><span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity</span><br/>
Xartemis XR contains acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5, 5.12)].</span></span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="following_xmChange">Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants<br/>
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7)].</span></span></span></p><ul class="Disk">

</ul><p>The Xartemis XR brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Xartemis XR</h2><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR is indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></span></p><p>Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>, reserve XARTEMIS XR for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics):</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated,</li>
<li>Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.</li>
</ul><h2>Xartemis XR Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR is not interchangeable with other oxycodone/acetaminophen products because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles that affect the frequency of administration.</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</li>
<li>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with XARTEMIS XR and adjust the dosage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p>XARTEMIS XR is given orally. Instruct patients to swallow XARTEMIS XR tablets whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in mouth <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. Do not break, chew, crush, cut, dissolve or split the tablets. Breaking, chewing, crushing, cutting, dissolving or splitting XARTEMIS XR tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of oxycodone and can lead to overdose or death <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>The total daily dose of acetaminophen from all drug products should not exceed 4,000 milligrams.</p><h3>Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use of XARTEMIS XR as the First Opioid Analgesic</span></p><p>The recommended dosage of XARTEMIS XR is 2 tablets every 12 hours administered with or without food. The second dose of 2 tablets may be administered as early as 8 hours after the initial dose if patients require analgesia at that time. Subsequent doses are to be administered 2 tablets every 12 hours.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with hepatic impairment start with one tablet and adjust dosage as needed. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with renal impairment start with one tablet and adjust dosage as needed. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications with Concomitant Use of Central Nervous System Depressants</h3><p class="First">If the patient is currently taking a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and the decision is made to begin Xartemis XR, start with one tablet every 12 hours, consider using a lower dosage of the concomitant CNS depressant, and monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Discontinuation of Xartemis XR</h3><p class="First">When a patient who has been taking XARTEMIS XR regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with XARTEMIS XR, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue XARTEMIS XR in a physically-dependent patient <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Xartemis XR is an extended-release tablet for oral administration. Each tablet contains 7.5 mg oxycodone hydrochloride and 325 mg acetaminophen.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR tablets are contraindicated in patients with</p><ul class="Disc">

As an opioid, XARTEMIS XR exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]</span>.</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed XARTEMIS XR. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing XARTEMIS XR, and monitor all patients receiving XARTEMIS XR for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as XARTEMIS XR, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of XARTEMIS XR along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing XARTEMIS XR. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><p>Abuse or misuse of XARTEMIS XR by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxycodone and can result in overdose and death <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression from opioid use, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of XARTEMIS XR, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with XARTEMIS XR and following dose increases.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of XARTEMIS XR are essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. Overestimating the XARTEMIS XR dose when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of XARTEMIS XR, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of XARTEMIS XR during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].</p><h3>Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Concomitant use of Xartemis XR with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Xartemis XR is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in Xartemis XR-treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong adverse reactions. When using Xartemis XR with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in Xartemis XR-treated patients, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of Xartemis XR until stable drug effects are achieved <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2), Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Concomitant use of Xartemis XR with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. When using Xartemis XR with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Xartemis XR contains oxycodone and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products. The typical daily acetaminophen contribution from Xartemis XR is 1,300 mg.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.</span></p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Xartemis XR with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Xartemis XR is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</span></p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of Xartemis XR in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease</span>: Xartemis XR-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Xartemis XR <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</span>: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating XARTEMIS XR and when XARTEMIS XR is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</span></p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Xartemis XR may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or triturating the dosage of XARTEMIS XR. In patients with circulatory shock, Xartemis XR may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of XARTEMIS XR in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Serious Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Inform patients about the signs of serious skin reactions, and discontinue use at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Xartemis XR may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Xartemis XR.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Xartemis XR in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis</h3><p class="First">There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue XARTEMIS XR immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe XARTEMIS XR for patients with acetaminophen allergy.</p><h3>Difficulty Swallowing</h3><p class="First">Due to characteristics of the formulation that cause the tablets to swell and become sticky when wet, consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing and patients at risk for underlying GI disorders resulting in a small gastrointestinal lumen. Instruct patients not to pre-soak, lick or otherwise wet XARTEMIS XR tablets prior to placing in the mouth, and to take one tablet at a time with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in mouth.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The oxycodone in Xartemis XR may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorder</h3><p class="First">The oxycodone in Xartemis XR may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Xartemis XR therapy.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Xartemis XR. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>When discontinuing Xartemis XR, gradually taper the dosage <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. Do not abruptly discontinue Xartemis XR <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.</p><p>Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Xartemis XR and know how they will react to the medication <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disc">

Treatment of pregnant rats with doses of acetaminophen approximately equal to the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) showed evidence of fetotoxicity and increases in bone variations in the fetuses. In another study, necrosis was observed in the liver and kidney of both pregnant rats and fetuses at doses approximately equal to the MHDD.

An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. XARTEMIS XR is not recommended for use in women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Xartemis XR, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Two large population based studies have evaluated the safety of acetaminophen in pregnant women during the first trimester; neither study showed an increased risk of congenital malformations. Available published data on oxycodone exposure during pregnancy and risk for malformations are limited and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>No reproductive or developmental studies were conducted with the combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen, the components of XARTEMIS XR. The following data are based on findings from studies performed with the individual components.</p><p>Studies in pregnant rats that received oral acetaminophen during organogenesis at doses up to 0.85 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD = 4 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison) showed evidence of fetotoxicity (reduced fetal weight and length) and a dose-related increase in bone variations (reduced ossification and rudimentary rib changes). Offspring had no evidence of external, visceral, or skeletal malformations. When pregnant rats received oral acetaminophen throughout gestation at doses of 1.2 times the MHDD (based on a body surface area comparison), areas of necrosis occurred in both the liver and kidney of pregnant rats and fetuses. These effects did not occur in animals that received oral acetaminophen at doses 0.3 times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison. In a continuous breeding study, pregnant mice received 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0% acetaminophen via the diet (357, 715, or 1430 mg/kg/day). These doses are approximately 0.43, 0.87, and 1.7 times the MHDD, respectively, based on a body surface area comparison. A dose-related reduction in body weights of fourth and fifth litter offspring of the treated mating pair occurred during lactation and post-weaning at all doses. Animals in the high dose group had a reduced number of litters per mating pair, male offspring with an increased percentage of abnormal sperm, and reduced birth weights in the next generation pups.</p><p>In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of oxycodone HCl administered during the period of organogenesis up to 16 mg/kg/day and up 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. These studies revealed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryo-fetal toxicity due to oxycodone. The highest doses tested in rats and rabbits were equivalent to approximately 2.6 and 8.1 times an adult human dose of 60 mg/day, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis. In published studies, offspring of pregnant rats administered oxycodone during gestation have been reported to exhibit neurobehavioral effects including altered stress responses, increased anxiety-like behavior (2 mg/kg/day IV from Gestation Day 8 to 21 and Postnatal Day 1, 3, and 5; 0.3 times an adult human dose of 60 mg/day, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and altered learning and memory (15 mg/kg/day orally from breeding through parturition; 2.4 times an adult human dose of 60 mg/day, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Oxycodone is present in breast milk. Published lactation studies report variable concentrations of oxycodone in breast milk with administration of immediate-release oxycodone to nursing mothers in the early postpartum period. The lactation studies did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse reactions. Lactation studies have not been conducted with extended-release oxycodone, including Xartemis XR, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Xartemis XR.</p><p>Acetaminophen is present in human milk in small quantities. Based on data from more than 15 nursing mothers, the calculated infant daily dose of acetaminophen is approximately 1 to 2% of the maternal dose. There is one well-documented report of a rash in a breast-fed infant that resolved when the mother stopped acetaminophen use and recurred when she resumed acetaminophen use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor infants exposed to Xartemis XR through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of XARTEMIS XR in pediatric patients under the age of 18 years have not been established. The use of Xartemis XR in the pediatric population is not recommended.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 607 subjects in the Phase 3 studies treated with XARTEMIS XR, 63 (10.3%) were older than age 65, of which 10 (1.6%) were older than age 75. No untoward or unexpected adverse reactions were seen in the elderly patients who received oxycodone hydrochloride/acetaminophen extended-release tablets. However, special precaution should be given when determining the dosing amount and frequency of XARTEMIS XR for geriatric patients, since a greater sensitivity to oxycodone may be observed in this patient population when compared to younger patients.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Xartemis XR slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Oxycodone and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR contains oxycodone and acetaminophen, which are extensively metabolized in the liver. Their clearance may be decreased in patients with hepatic impairment. In patients with hepatic impairment a dosage adjustment is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Information from oxycodone HCl indicates that patients with renal impairment had higher plasma concentrations of oxycodone than subjects with normal renal function. In patients with renal impairment, a dosage adjustment is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Xartemis XR contains oxycodone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. Xartemis XR can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>XARTEMIS XR, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to the Abuse of XARTEMIS XR</span></span></p><p>XARTEMIS XR is for oral use only. Abuse of XARTEMIS XR poses a risk of overdose and death. Abuse may occur by taking intact tablets in quantities greater than prescribed or without legitimate purpose, by crushing and chewing, or snorting the crushed formulation, or by injecting a solution made from the crushed formulation. The risk of overdose and death is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants.</p><p>With intravenous abuse, the inactive ingredients in XARTEMIS XR can result in death, local tissue necrosis, infection, pulmonary granulomas, and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury. Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine) or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Xartemis XR should not be abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>. If Xartemis XR is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur. Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome: restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Use in</span> <span class="Italics">Specific</span> <span class="Italics">Populations (8.1, 8.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Following an acute overdosage, toxicity may result from the oxycodone or the acetaminophen.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Oxycodone</span></span></p><p>Acute overdosage with Xartemis XR is often characterized by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, sometimes, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death.

Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>A single or multiple drug overdose with oxycodone and acetaminophen is a potentially lethal polydrug overdose, and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended. Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, assisted ventilation, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Oxycodone</span></span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists naloxone or nalmefene are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose.</p><p>For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxycodone overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in Xartemis XR, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Acetaminophen</span></span></p><p>Gastric decontamination with activated charcoal should be administered just prior to N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease systemic absorption if acetaminophen ingestion is known or suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving liver injury is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.</p><p>Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe intoxication. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose-dependent and occurs early in the course of intoxication.</p><h2>Xartemis XR Description</h2><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen) extended-release tablets combine two analgesics, oxycodone hydrochloride 7.5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg for oral administration.</p><p>Oxycodone hydrochloride, 4,5α-epoxy-14-hydroxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-one hydrochloride, is an opioid agonist which occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder having a saline, bitter taste. It is derived from the opium alkaloid thebaine. The structural formula for oxycodone hydrochloride is as follows:</p><p>Acetaminophen, 4'-hydroxyacetanilide, is a white, odorless, crystalline powder, possessing a slightly bitter taste. The structural formula for acetaminophen is as follows:</p><p>XARTEMIS XR is an extended-release tablet for oral administration containing both immediate- and extended-release components. XARTEMIS XR is formulated to immediately release a portion of its oxycodone and acetaminophen doses. XARTEMIS XR is designed to swell in gastric fluid and gradually release the remainder of oxycodone and acetaminophen to the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p><p>XARTEMIS XR also contains the following inactive ingredients: polyethylene oxide (Polyox), microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, polyvinyl alcohol, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, pregelatinized starch, FD&amp;C Blue #2 aluminum lake, citric acid anhydrous powder, and edetate disodium.</p><h2>Xartemis XR - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</p><p>Acetaminophen is a non-opioid, non-salicylate analgesic, and antipyretic. The site and mechanism for the analgesic effect of acetaminophen has not been determined. The antipyretic effect of acetaminophen is accomplished through the inhibition of endogenous pyrogen action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating centers.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brainstem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretions are decreased by oxycodone HCl. Oxycodone, like other opioid analgesics, produces some degree of nausea and vomiting which is caused by direct stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone located in the medulla. The frequency and severity of emesis gradually diminishes with time.</p><p>Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Oxycodone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration-Efficacy Relationships</span></p><p>The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of (active moiety) for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration-Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.4)]</span>.</p><p>The dose of Xartemis XR must be individualized because the effective analgesic dose for some patients will be too high to be tolerated by other patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">XARTEMIS XR is an extended-release bilayer formulation of oxycodone and acetaminophen (immediate- and extended-release layers) which is not interchangeable with other oxycodone/acetaminophen products because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles that affect the frequency of administration. The activity of oxycodone hydrochloride is primarily due to the parent drug oxycodone.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The oral bioavailability of oxycodone is 60 to 87%. Bioavailability (dose-normalized AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of oxycodone and acetaminophen following single- and multiple-doses of XARTEMIS XR tablets is comparable to immediate-release products containing oxycodone or acetaminophen.</p><p>Oxycodone plasma concentrations from this bilayer product are detectable within 30 minutes and reach a maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) in 3 to 4 hours after XARTEMIS XR administration. Maximum plasma concentrations of acetaminophen occur in 0.75 to 1 hour after XARTEMIS XR administration.</p><p>Steady-state plasma concentrations of oxycodone and acetaminophen are achieved within 24 hours of initiation of dosing of XARTEMIS XR (prior to the third dose of two XARTEMIS XR tablets administered every 12 hours).
