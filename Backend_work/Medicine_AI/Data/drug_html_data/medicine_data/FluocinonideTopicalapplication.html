Fluocinonide is a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine or steroid).</p><p>Fluocinonide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using fluocinonide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fluocinonide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fluocinonide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluocinonide topical in the pediatric population. However, because of fluocinonide's toxicity, it should be used with caution. Children may absorb large amounts through the skin, which can cause serious side effects. If your child is using fluocinonide, follow your doctor's instructions very carefully. For <i>Vanos® cream</i>, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 12 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Vanos® cream</i> in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related medical problems, which may require caution in patients receiving <i>Vanos® cream</i>.</p><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of fluocinonide topical in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of fluocinonide. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Cushing's syndrome (adrenal gland disorder) or</li>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) or</li>
<li>Intracranial hypertension (increased pressure in the head)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Infection of the skin at or near the place of application or</li>

<li>Rosacea (skin problem)—Vanos® cream should not be used in patients with these conditions.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of fluocinonide</h2><p><i>It is very important that you use fluocinonide only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may cause unwanted side effects or skin irritation.</p><p><i>Fluocinonide is for use on the skin only</i>. Do not get it in your eyes, nose, mouth, or vagina. Do not use it on skin areas that have cuts, scrapes, or burns. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off right away with water.</p><p>Fluocinonide should only be used for skin conditions that your doctor is treating. <i>Check with your doctor before using it for other conditions, especially if you think that a skin infection may be present</i>.

<li>Do not use it on the face, groin, or underarms unless directed to do so by your doctor.</li>
