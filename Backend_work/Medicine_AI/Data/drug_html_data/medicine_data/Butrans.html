Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>Buprenorphine can pass into breast milk and cause drowsiness, breathing problems, or death in a nursing baby. You should not breast-feed while you are using Butrans.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Butrans?</h2><p>Use Butrans exactly as prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Buprenorphine can slow or stop your breathing. Never use Butrans in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Buprenorphine may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Never share Butrans with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. <b>MISUSE OF NARCOTIC MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Selling or giving away Butrans is against the law.</p><p>The Butrans skin patch is for use only on the skin. Do not allow the medicine to come into contact with your eyes, nose, mouth, or lips.</p><p>Keep both used and unused Butrans patches out of the reach of children or pets. <b>Even the amount of buprenorphine in a used skin patch could be fatal to a child or pet who accidentally sucks or chews on the patch.</b> Seek emergency medical attention if this happens.</p><p>Use only clear water (not soap or other chemicals) to wash the skin before you apply a patch.</p><p>Apply the Butrans patch to clean, dry skin on the chest, back, side, or outer side of your upper arm. Wear the patch around the clock for 7 days. Never wear more than 1 patch at a time unless your doctor has told you to. Remove and replace the patch after 7 days. Apply the new patch to a different skin area on the chest, back, side, or upper arm.</p><p>If the sticky side of a skin patch comes into contact with your hands, wash the skin with clear water and seek medical care at once. <b>Do not use a Butrans skin patch if it has been cut or damaged.</b></p><p><b>Do not wear a skin patch on a part of your body where a child could reach or remove the patch from your skin</b>. Avoid allowing children to watch you put on a skin patch. Never tell a child that the buprenorphine skin patch is a "bandage".</p><p>Do not stop using this medicine suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using Butrans.</p><p>Store the Butrans skin patches at room temperature. Keep each patch in its foil pouch until you are ready to use it. <b>Keep track of how many skin patches have been used from each new package.</b> Buprenorphine is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>After removing a skin patch: fold it in half firmly with the sticky side in, and flush the patch down the toilet or use the Patch-Disposal Unit provided with this medication. Do not place a used skin patch into a trash can.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, dispose of any unused skin patches in the same folded manner. Do not flush the foil pouch or patch liners; place them in a trash container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you forget to change a patch on your scheduled day, remove the patch and apply a new one as soon as you remember. Do not wear extra patches to make up a missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A buprenorphine overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include severe drowsiness, muscle weakness, cold and clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, a weak pulse, very slow breathing, or coma.</p><p><b>Buprenorphine can cause death in a child who gets a hold of a skin patch and places it in the mouth or on the skin.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using Butrans?</h2><p><b>Avoid sources of heat while wearing the patch.</b> Tell your doctor if you have a fever. Do not use a heating pad or electric blanket, tanning bed or sauna.
