</ul><h3>Recommended Adult Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Motion Sickness</span></p><p>Apply one scopolamine transdermal system to the hairless area behind one ear at least 4 hours before the antiemetic effect is required – for use up to 3 days. If therapy is required for longer than 3 days, remove the first transdermal system and apply a new scopolamine transdermal system behind the other ear.</p><p><span class="Bold">PONV</span></p><p><span class="Italics">For surgeries other than cesarean section:</span> Apply one scopolamine transdermal system the evening before scheduled surgery. Remove the transdermal system 24 hours following surgery.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Transdermal system: a circular, flat, tan-colored transdermal system imprinted with “Scopolamine 1 mg/3 days”</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Scopolamine transdermal system is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul>
<li>angle closure glaucoma <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></li>
<li>hypersensitivity to scopolamine or other belladonna alkaloids or to any ingredient or component in the formulation or delivery system. Reactions have included rash generalized and erythema <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Description (11)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma</h3><p class="First">The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema).</p><h3>Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Seizures</span></p><p>Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cognitive Adverse Reactions</span></p><p>Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>. Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hazardous Activities</span></p><p>Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely.</p><h3>Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women</h3><p class="First">Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders</h3><p class="First">Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination.</p><h3>Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms.</p><h3>Blurred Vision</h3><p class="First">Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes.<br/>
Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns</h3><p class="First">Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span></li>
<li>Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span></li>
<li>Blurred Vision <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
<li>MRI Skin Burns <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Motion Sickness</span></p><p>The most common adverse reaction (approximately two thirds) was dry mouth. Less common adverse reactions, included drowsiness (less than one sixth), blurred vision and dilation of the pupils.</p><p><span class="Bold">PONV</span></p><p>Common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 3% of patients in PONV clinical trials are shown in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Scopolamine Transdermal System</span></p><p><span class="Bold">% (N=461)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">% (N=457)</span></p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of scopolamine transdermal system. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders:</span> acute psychosis including: hallucinations, disorientation, and paranoia</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders:</span> headache, amnesia, coordination abnormalities, speech disorder, disturbance in attention, restlessness</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions:</span> application site burning</p><p><span class="Italics">Eye disorders:</span> dry eyes, eye pruritus, angle closure glaucoma, amblyopia, eyelid irritation</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:</span> rash generalized, skin irritation, erythema</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal and urinary disorders:</span> dysuria</p><p><span class="Italics">Ear and labyrinth disorders:</span> vertigo</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions.</p><h3>Anticholinergic Drugs</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)],</span> intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach</h3><p class="First">Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.</p><h3>Interaction with Gastric Secretion Test</h3><p class="First">Scopolamine will interfere with the gastric secretion test. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system 10 days prior to testing.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from observational studies and postmarketing reports with scopolamine use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia because eclamptic seizures have been reported after exposure to scopolamine <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>In animal studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects with intravenous administration of scopolamine hydrobromide revealed in rats. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at intravenous doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Eclamptic Seizures In published case reports, two pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia were administered intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine, respectively, and developed eclamptic seizures soon after scopolamine administration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In animal reproduction studies, when pregnant rats and rabbits received scopolamine hydrobromide by daily intravenous injection, no adverse effects were observed in rats. An embryotoxic effect was observed in rabbits at doses producing plasma levels approximately 100 times the levels achieved in humans using a transdermal system. Scopolamine administered parenterally to rats and rabbits at doses higher than the dose delivered by scopolamine transdermal system did not affect uterine contractions or increase the duration of labor.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Scopolamine is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of scopolamine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Because there have been no consistent reports of adverse events in breastfed infants over decades of use, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for scopolamine transdermal system and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from scopolamine transdermal system or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse reactions of scopolamine; including mydriasis, hallucinations, amblyopia and drug withdrawal syndrome. Neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, amblyopia and mydriasis have also been reported.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of scopolamine transdermal system did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects. In other clinical experience, elderly patients had an increased risk of neurologic and psychiatric adverse reactions, such as hallucinations, confusion, dizziness and drug withdrawal syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5)]</span>. Consider more frequent monitoring for CNS adverse reactions during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. </p><h3>Renal or Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Scopolamine transdermal system has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients with renal or hepatic impairment because of the increased risk of CNS adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance Class</h3><p class="First">Scopolamine transdermal system contains scopolamine, which is not a controlled substance.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Termination of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension<span class="Italics">.</span> These withdrawal symptoms indicate that scopolamine, like other anticholinergic drugs, may produce physical dependence. The onset of these symptoms, generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed, can be severe and may require medical intervention <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity include: lethargy, somnolence, coma, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypertension, and supraventricular arrhythmias. These symptoms can be severe and may require medical intervention.</p><p>In cases of toxicity remove the scopolamine transdermal system. Serious symptomatic cases of overdosage involving multiple transdermal system applications and/or ingestion may be managed by initially ensuring the patient has an adequate airway and supporting respiration and circulation. This should be rapidly followed by removal of all transdermal systems from the skin and the mouth. If there is evidence of transdermal system ingestion, endoscopic removal of swallowed transdermal systems, or administration of activated charcoal should be considered, as indicated by the clinical situation. In any case where there is serious overdosage or signs of evolving acute toxicity, continuous monitoring of vital signs and ECG, establishment of intravenous access, and administration of oxygen are all recommended.</p><p>The signs and symptoms of overdose/toxicity due to scopolamine should be carefully distinguished from the occasionally observed syndrome of withdrawal <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</span> Although mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both acute toxicity and withdrawal, other characteristic findings differ: tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds suggest anticholinergic toxicity, while bradycardia, headache, nausea and abdominal cramps, and sweating suggest post-removal withdrawal.</p><p>If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage.</p><h2>Scopolamine Patch Description</h2><p class="First">Scopolamine transdermal system is designed for continuous release of scopolamine following application to an area of intact skin on the head, behind the ear. Each system contains 1.5 mg of scopolamine base. Scopolamine is (9-methyl-3-oxa-9-azatricyclo[3.3.1.0<span class="Sup">2,4</span>]nonan-7-yl) 3-hydroxy-2 phenylpropanoate. The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">4</span> and its structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Scopolamine has a molecular weight of 303.35 and a pKa of 7.55-7.81. The scopolamine transdermal system is a circular, 0.2 mm thick, 2.5 cm<span class="Sup">2</span> film with four layers. Proceeding from the visible surface towards the surface attached to the skin, these layers are: (1) a backing membrane of tan-colored, aluminized, polyester film printed with brown ink; (2) a drug adhesive layer of scopolamine, acrylic adhesive and isopropyl myristate; (3) an ethylene vinyl acetate membrane that controls the rate of delivery of scopolamine from the system to the skin surface; and (4) a drug adhesive layer of scopolamine, acrylic adhesive and isopropyl myristate. A release liner of siliconized polyester, which covers the adhesive layer, is removed before the system is used. The brown imprinting ink contains FD&amp;C yellow no. 6 aluminum lake, polyamide resin, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene wax, carbon black and quinacridone red pigment.</p><p>Cross section of the system:</p><p></p><h2>Scopolamine Patch - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, is an anticholinergic. Scopolamine acts: i) as a competitive inhibitor at postganglionic muscarinic receptor sites of the parasympathetic nervous system, and ii) on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. It has been suggested that scopolamine acts in the central nervous system (CNS) by blocking cholinergic transmission from the vestibular nuclei to higher centers in the CNS and from the reticular formation to the vomiting center. Scopolamine can inhibit the secretion of saliva and sweat, decrease gastrointestinal secretions and motility, cause drowsiness, dilate the pupils, increase heart rate, and depress motor function.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The system is formulated to deliver approximately 1 mg of scopolamine to the systemic circulation over 3 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following application to the skin behind the ear, circulating plasma concentrations are detected within 4 hours with peak concentrations being obtained, on average, within 24 hours. The average plasma concentration produced is 87 pg/mL (0.28 nM) for free scopolamine and 354 pg/mL for total scopolamine (free + conjugates). Following removal of the used transdermal system, there is some degree of continued systemic absorption of scopolamine bound in the skin layers.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The distribution of scopolamine is not well characterized. It crosses the placenta and the blood brain barrier and may be reversibly bound to plasma proteins.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>Scopolamine is metabolized and conjugated with less than 5% of the total dose appearing unchanged in the urine. The enzymes responsible for metabolizing scopolamine are unknown. The exact elimination pattern of scopolamine has not been determined. Following transdermal system removal, plasma concentrations of scopolamine decline in a log linear fashion with an observed half-life of 9.5 hours. Less than 10% of the total dose is excreted in the urine as the parent drug and metabolites over 108 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study using human hepatocytes examined the induction of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 by scopolamine. Scopolamine did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 10 nM. In an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> study using human liver microsomes which evaluated the inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4, scopolamine did not inhibit these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at the concentrations up to 1 micromolar. No <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of scopolamine. The mutagenic potential of scopolamine has not been evaluated.</p><p>Fertility studies were performed in female rats and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to scopolamine hydrobromide administered by daily subcutaneous injection. Maternal body weights were reduced in the highest-dose group (plasma level approximately 500 times the level achieved in humans using a transdermal system). However, fertility studies in male animals were not performed.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Prevention of Motion Sickness</h3><p class="First">In 195 adult subjects of different racial origins who participated in clinical efficacy studies at sea or in a controlled motion environment, there was a 75% reduction in the incidence of motion-induced nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine transdermal system was applied from 4 to 16 hours prior to the onset of motion in these studies.</p><h3>Prevention of Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting</h3><p class="First">A clinical efficacy study evaluated 168 adult female patients undergoing gynecological surgery with anesthesia and opiate analgesia. Patients received scopolamine transdermal system or placebo applied approximately 11 hours before anesthesia/opiate analgesia. No retching/vomiting during the 24-hour post-operative period was reported in 79% of those treated with scopolamine transdermal system compared to 72% of those receiving placebo. When the need for additional antiemetic medication was assessed during the same period, there was no need for medication in 89% of patients treated with scopolamine transdermal system as compared to 72% of placebo-treated patients.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Scopolamine transdermal system 1 mg/3 days is available as the following:</p><p>Carton of 4 transdermal systems, packaged into individual foil pouches.
