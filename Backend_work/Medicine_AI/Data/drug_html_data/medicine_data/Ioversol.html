A healthcare provider will give you this injection.</p><p>Drink extra fluids before and after your radiologic test. Ioversol can cause you to get dehydrated, which can lead to dangerous effects on your kidneys. Follow your doctor's instructions about the types and amount of fluids you should drink before and after your test.</p><p>Older adults may need special care to avoid becoming dehydrated. Your kidney function may need to be checked after you have received ioversol.</p><p>Tell your caregivers if you feel any burning, pain, or swelling around the IV needle when ioversol is injected.</p><p>Some people receiving ioversol have had delayed reactions 30 to 60 minutes after injection. Your caregivers will watch you during this time to make sure you do not have unwanted side effects or delayed reactions.</p><p>Ioversol can cause unusual results with certain medical tests for up to 16 days after you receive  ioversol. For up to 8 weeks after you receive ioversol, your body may not respond as well as usual to radioactive iodine thyroid treatment. Tell any doctor who treats you that have recently received ioversol.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since ioversol is used only during your radiologic test, you will not be on a dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  ioversol is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.
