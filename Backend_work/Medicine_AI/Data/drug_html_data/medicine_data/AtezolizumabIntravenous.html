Atezolizumab is given to patients who have received other cancer medicines (eg, platinum) that did not work well, or in patients who cannot receive cancer medicines containing cisplatin and whose cancer has high levels of a specific protein called programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or in patients with or without PD-L1- expressing cancers who cannot receive cancer medicines containing platinum.</p><p>Atezolizumab injection is also used as first-line treatment for metastatic (cancer that has already spread) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose tumors express high PD-L1 and do not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. Your doctor will perform a test to check for the PD-L1 tumor before you receive atezolizumab. It is used together with other cancer medicines (eg, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin combination, or paclitaxel protein-bound and carboplatin combination) as first-line treatment to metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in patients whose tumor does not have an abnormal EGFR or ALK gene. It is also used to treat metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with or without an EGFR or ALK gene in patients who have tried treatment for EGFR or ALK tumors and received cancer medicines containing platinum that did not work well.</p><p>Atezolizumab injection is also used together with other cancer medicines (eg, paclitaxel protein-bound) to treat patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery and whose tumors express PD-L1.</p><p>Atezolizumab injection is also used together with carboplatin and etoposide as first-line treatment for extensive-stage (cancer that has spread) small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).</p><p>Atezolizumab injection is also used together with bevacizumab to treat a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that has spread throughout the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) in patients who have not received other cancer medicines by mouth or injection.</p><p>Atezolizumab injection is also used together with cobimetinib and vemurafenib to treat melanoma (a type of skin cancer) that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.
