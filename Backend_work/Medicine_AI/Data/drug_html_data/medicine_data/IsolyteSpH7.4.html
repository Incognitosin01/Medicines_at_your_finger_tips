Refer to the Directions for Use of the container.</p><h2>Isolyte S pH 7.4 - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Isolyte<span class="Sup">®</span> S pH 7.4 provides electrolytes and is a source of water for hydration. It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.</p><p>Sodium, the major cation of the extracellular fluid, functions primarily in the control of water distribution, fluid balance, and osmotic pressure of body fluids. Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid-base equilibrium of body fluid.</p><p>Potassium, the principal cation of intracellular fluid, participates in carbohydrate utilization and protein synthesis, and is critical in the regulation of nerve conduction and muscle contraction, particularly in the heart.</p><p>Chloride, the major extracellular anion, closely follows the metabolism of sodium, and changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration.</p><p>Phosphate is a major intracellular anion which participates in providing energy for metabolism of substrates and contributes to significant metabolic and enzymatic reactions in almost all organs and tissues. It exerts a modifying influence on calcium levels, a buffering effect on acid-base equilibrium and has a primary role in the renal excretion of hydrogen ions.</p><p>Magnesium, a principal cation of soft tissue, is primarily involved in enzyme activity associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates and protein. Magnesium is also involved in neuromuscular irritability.</p><p>Gluconate and acetate are organic ions which are hydrogen ion acceptors and contribute bicarbonate during their metabolism to carbon dioxide and water, and serve as alkalinizing agents.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Isolyte S pH 7.4</h2><p class="First">This solution is indicated for use in adults as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, and as an alkalinizing agent.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Contraindications: None known. Accurate clinical and laboratory estimation of fluid and electrolyte balance in order to access benefit/risk ratio are essential prior to administration of this solution (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>).</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration.</p><p>Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema.</p><p>In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention.</p><p>Solutions containing potassium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with hyperkalemia, severe renal failure, and in conditions in which potassium retention is present.</p><p>Solutions containing gluconate or acetate should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis and in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of these ions, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.</p><p>Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.</p><p>Additional essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins should be supplied as needed.</p><p>Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.</p><p>Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.</p><p>Solutions containing potassium or magnesium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease.</p><p>Solutions containing gluconate or acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.</p><p>To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.</p><p>Do not use plastic containers in series connection.</p><p>If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (&gt;300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.</p><p>This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.</p><p>Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern, in this or an alternative solution.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.</p><p>Administration of barbiturates, narcotics, hypnotics or systemic anesthetics should be adjusted with caution in patients also receiving magnesium-containing solutions because of an additive central depressive effect.</p><p>Parenteral magnesium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long term animal studies with Isolyte<span class="Sup">®</span> S pH 7.4 (Multi-Electrolyte Injection) have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential, or effects on fertility.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Isolyte<span class="Sup">®</span> S pH 7.4 (Multi-Electrolyte Injection). It is also not known whether Isolyte<span class="Sup">®</span> S pH 7.4 can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Isolyte<span class="Sup">®</span> S pH 7.4 should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">As reported in the literature, electrolyte solutions have been administered during labor and delivery. Caution should be exercised, and the fluid balance, glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance, of both mother and fetus should be evaluated periodically or whenever warranted by the condition of the patient or fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised when Isolyte<span class="Sup">®</span> S pH 7.4 (Multi-Electrolyte Injection) is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><p>See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.</p><p>Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.</p><p>Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water, resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume.</p><p>Reactions reported with the use of potassium-containing solutions include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities, areflexia, muscular or respiratory paralysis, mental confusion, weakness, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiac arrest. Potassium deficits result in disruption of neuromuscular function, and intestinal ileus and dilatation.</p><p>If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.</p><p>Phosphorus deficiency may lead to impaired tissue oxygenation and acute hemolytic anemia. Relative to calcium, excessive phosphorus intake can precipitate hypocalcemia with cramps, tetany and muscular hyperexcitability.</p><p>Abnormally high plasma levels of magnesium can result in flushing, sweating, hypotension, circulatory collapse, and depression of cardiac and central nervous system function. Respiratory depression is the most immediate threat to life. Magnesium deficits can result in tachycardia, hypertension, hyperirritability and psychotic behavior.</p><p>The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives. Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted.</p><p>If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of a fluid or solute overload during parenteral therapy, reevaluate the patient's condition, and institute appropriate corrective treatment.</p><p>In the event of overdosage with potassium-containing solutions, discontinue the infusion immediately and institute corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels.</p><p>Treatment of hyperkalemia includes the following:</p><p>Over-aggressive phosphate replacement may precipitate hypocalcemic tetany. To prevent hypocalcemia, calcium supplementation should always accompany phosphate administration.</p><h2>Isolyte S pH 7.4 Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">This solution is for intravenous use only.</p><p>Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy.</p><p>Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient.</p><p>Isolyte<span class="Sup">®</span> S pH 7.4 (Multi-Electrolyte Injection) may be admixed with solutions which contain phosphate or which have been supplemented with phosphate.</p><p>The presence of magnesium and phosphate ions in this solution should be considered when phosphate is present in the additive solution, in order to avoid precipitation.</p><p>Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>How is Isolyte S pH 7.4 Supplied</h2><p class="First">Isolyte<span class="Sup">®</span> S pH 7.4 (Multi-Electrolyte Injection) is supplied sterile and nonpyrogenic in EXCEL<span class="Sup">®</span> Containers.
