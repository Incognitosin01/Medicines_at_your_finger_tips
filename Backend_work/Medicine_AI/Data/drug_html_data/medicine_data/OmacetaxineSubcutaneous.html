</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for omacetaxine</h2><p>Omacetaxine injection is used to treat chronic or accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It is used in patients who have already received medicines for CML that did not work well. Leukemia is a type of cancer where the body makes abnormal white blood cells.</p><p>Omacetaxine is an antineoplastic (cancer) medicine. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed by the body. Since the growth of normal cells may also be affected by omacetaxine, other side effects can occur. Before you begin treatment, talk to your doctor about the benefits of omacetaxine as well as the possible risks of using it.</p><p>Omacetaxine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of a doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using omacetaxine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For omacetaxine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to omacetaxine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of omacetaxine injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of omacetaxine injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of omacetaxine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Anemia (low red blood cells) or</li>
<li>Bleeding problems or</li>
<li>Diabetes or</li>
<li>Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) or</li>
<li>Neutropenia (low white blood cells) or</li>
<li>Thrombocytopenia (low platelets in the blood)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Infection—May decrease your body's ability to fight infection.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of omacetaxine</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you omacetaxine. Omacetaxine is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the stomach (abdomen) or thigh.</p><p>Omacetaxine should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Call your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>You may also be taught how to give omacetaxine at home. Read and follow the directions in the Instructions for Use sheet before giving yourself an injection. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to. Call your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>To use at home:</p><ul>
<li>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area for each shot.</li>
<li>Do not inject into skin areas that are tender, red, bruised, hard, or have scars or stretch marks.</li>
<li>Do not eat or drink while handling omacetaxine. Use it in an area away from food or food preparation.</li>
<li>Wear disposable gloves and protective eyewear when handling omacetaxine.</li>
<li>Wash your hands before and after wearing the gloves.</li>
<li>Do not recap or clip the used needle. This could cause a needle-stick injury.</li>
<li>If you get omacetaxine on your skin, wash the area with soap and water.</li>
<li>If you get omacetaxine in your eyes, flush the eyes with water and call your doctor right away.</li>
<li>If you accidentally spill omacetaxine, do not touch the area unless you are wearing gloves and protective eyewear. Use an adsorbent pad to wipe the spill and wash the area with soap and water. Put all the supplies that were used to clean the spill in the biohazard container and call your healthcare provider right away to report the spill.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of omacetaxine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of omacetaxine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

Put all of the used supplies in the <i>biohazard container</i> and return it to your doctor for disposal.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using omacetaxine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using omacetaxine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. Use an effective form of birth control to keep from getting pregnant during treatment and at least 6 months after the last dose. Men should not father a child for at least 3 months after treatment ends. If you think you or your partner have become pregnant while using omacetaxine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Omacetaxine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>Omacetaxine may make you feel tired. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how omacetaxine affects you</i>.</p><p>Omacetaxine may affect blood sugar levels. Check with your doctor if you are diabetic and notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests.</p><p>Cancer medicines can cause stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, even after receiving medicines to prevent it. Ask your doctor or nurse about ways to control these side effects.</p><p>If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before using omacetaxine. Some men using omacetaxine have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Omacetaxine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
