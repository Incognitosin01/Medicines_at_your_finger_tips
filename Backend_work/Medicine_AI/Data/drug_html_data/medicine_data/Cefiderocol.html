Use the medicine exactly as directed. Cefiderocol is sometimes given for up to 14 days.</p><p>Cefiderocol is given as an infusion into a vein. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>This medicine must be given slowly, and the infusion can take at least 3 hours to complete.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare an injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine has changed colors or has particles in it.

When using injections by yourself, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine.</p><p>Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve. Skipping doses can increase your risk of infection that is resistant to medication. Cefiderocol will not treat a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold.</p><p>This medicine can affect the results of certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using cefiderocol.</p><p>Store unmixed cefiderocol in the original carton in a refrigerator. Protect from light and do not freeze.</p><p>After mixing cefiderocol with a diluent, keep the vial at room temperature and further dilute it within 1 hour. After diluting the mixture into an IV bag, keep the bag at room temperature and use it within 6 hours.</p><p>Each IV bag is for one use only. Throw it away after one use, even if there is still medicine left inside.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container.
