This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ziconotide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ziconotide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of ziconotide injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of ziconotide injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have confusion and age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving ziconotide injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of ziconotide.

It is very important that you follow your doctor's instructions about the care of the catheter and the use of the infusion pump.</p><p>If you or your caregiver notice any signs of meningitis such as confusion, drowsiness, fever, headache, nausea or vomiting, seizures, or stiff neck, call your doctor right away.</p><p>Ziconotide may cause some people to become dizzy, drowsy, confused, disoriented, clumsy, or less alert than they are normally. <i>Make sure you know how you react to ziconotide before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert</i>.</p><p>Ziconotide will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert).
