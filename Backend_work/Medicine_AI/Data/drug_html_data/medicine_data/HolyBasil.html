It can grow up to 1 m in height. Green and purple color variants exist that are otherwise morphologically indistinguishable.</p><p>Unlike common basil, holy basil plants have slightly hairy, pale leaves that are simple, opposite, and oblong or ovate, measuring 3 to 7 cm long and 1 to 3 cm wide. The leaves have a characteristically strong aroma, likened to that of cloves, and an astringent taste. The flowering part of the plant consists of a florescence of purple and red flowers. Related plants include Ocimum basilicum (sweet basil), Ocimum gratissimum (African basil), Ocimum campechianum (Amazonian basil), and Ocimum canum (hoary basil).1, 2, 3 A synonym of O. tenuiflorum is Ocimum sanctum.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Use of tulsi is described in ancient Ayurvedic texts, and the plant is an important symbol in Hindu religious tradition. Holy basil has been described as an elixir of life and a tonic with adaptogenic properties. It has been used to promote longevity and to treat a range of conditions, including the common cold, headache, stomach complaints, inflammation, heart disease, insect or snake bites, and malaria. Holy basil is used in cooking and is consumed as a fresh leaf, an herbal tea, a dried powder, or mixed with ghee. The dried leaves can be stored with grains and used as an insect repellent. The essential oil is used in cosmetics and skin preparations.1, 4, 5</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>O. tenuiflorum primarily contains tannins, flavonoids, and an essential oil. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been used to elucidate the constituents of the essential oil, which include eugenol and methyl eugenol (up to 64%), alpha- and beta-caryophyllene, 1,8 cineole, methyl chavicol, carvacrol, linalool, thymol, limonene, gamma-terpinene, camphor, germacrene A, beta-ocimene, and cinnamyl acetate. Chemical composition varies with geographical location and other environmental and genetic factors.1, 6, 7, 8, 9 Additional constituents, among others, include oleanolic acid, rosmarinic acid, ursolic acid, apigenins, luteolins, cerebrosides, and acimumosides.1, 7, 8, 10 Traces of zinc, manganese, sodium, and vitamins A and C have been identified.8</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Despite traditional use of holy basil for various medical conditions, clinical trials examining such uses are lacking. Many therapeutic effects are attributed to the antioxidant action of the extracts and individual chemical constituents.7, 8</p><h3>Anticancer/Radioprotection</h3><p>In animal studies, extracts of holy basil were protective against radiation-induced DNA damage, probably via antioxidant mechanisms.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16</p><p>In vitro studies have demonstrated activity against human cancer cell lines, including brain, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and ovarian carcinomas, as well as neuroblastoma and leukemia.17, 18, 19, 20 Anticancer activity has also been demonstrated in rodent studies.21, 22, 23</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of holy basil in cancer.</p><h3>Antimicrobial activity</h3><p>Extracts of holy basil, particularly those containing eugenol, have shown in vitro activity against a number of microorganisms, including Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, and resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoea.24, 25, 26 Activity against Candida albicans has also been demonstrated in vitro.27 Reports of efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the parasite Leishmania donovani have been published.28, 29</p><p>Inhibition of dental caries and periodontal pathogens (including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,30 Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis)31 has been demonstrated in several in vitro studies.32 Another study reported antimicrobial activity of an O. sanctum 2% gel in the treatment of experimentally induced periodontitis in rats.33</p><p>A small clinical trial evaluated an O. sanctum mouthwash (in polyethylene glycol and water) compared with a chlorhexidine mouthwash and placebo. Reductions in gingival bleeding and plaque indices, similar to those with chlorhexidine, were achieved with the herbal extract compared with placebo.34</p><h3>CNS effects</h3><p>Experiments in rats have demonstrated a protective effect of holy basil extracts against noise-induced stress. Pretreatment with holy basil extract prevented the increases in circulating corticosterone, dopamine, and serotonin levels induced by noise exposure; other adaptogenic effects on biochemical changes in acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase, and creatine kinase have also been reported.35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40</p><p>Analgesic and anticonvulsant actions have been described in animals, as well as attenuation of the effects of cerebrovascular insufficiency, induced axonal degeneration, and memory deficits.1, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44 Models of Parkinson disease and induced dementia suggest potential applications of holy basil extracts.39, 45, 46 Reduced stress, similar to the effects of alprazolam, was observed in rats fed O. sanctum in forced swim tests.47</p><p>In healthy volunteers, holy basil administered over 30 days improved cognition (measured by reaction times and error rates on standard tests) compared with placebo. Improvements were also observed in salivary cortisol and anxiety scores.48 Limited clinical studies suggest that O. tenuiflorum improves symptoms of stress disorders compared to placebo.49, 50, 51</p><h3>Diabetes/Metabolic syndrome</h3><p>In animal experiments, O. tenuiflorum improved lipid profiles and demonstrated antioxidant, cardioprotective, and hypoglycemic effects, suggesting a potential role in the management of metabolic syndromes.52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62 Suggested mechanisms include insulin-secretory effects and reductions in insulin resistance, inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, and enhanced activity of glucokinase, hexokinase, and phosphofructokinase enzymes.52, 53, 54, 59</p><p>In a 2004 Cochrane review evaluating use of traditional plants in hyperglycemia, holy basil produced a hypoglycemic response compared with placebo in 1 small trial (N=40). However, poor methodological quality related to inadequate blinding and randomization was noted, and no trials compared holy basil with pharmacological agents.63 A more recent, small study using holy basil extract 250 mg twice daily for 8 weeks noted statistically significant improvements in body mass index and in lipid and insulin levels in overweight and obese patients 17 to 30 years of age.64</p><h3>Anti-inflammatory activity</h3><p>In vitro studies demonstrate possible effects of holy basil extracts on inflammatory markers,21, 25, 65 while in studies of rats with isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction, pretreatment with methanolic extract of O. tenuiflorum leaves decreased  lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase activity and leukotriene and thromboxane levels.66 In a carrageenan-induced paw edema study in rodents, the ethyl acetate root extract of holy basil was effective as an anti-inflammatory agent.67 Another study reported anti-inflammatory activity of an O. sanctum 2% gel in the treatment of experimentally induced periodontitis in rats.33</p><p>A small clinical study (N=29) reported improved healing rates with administration of O. tenuiflorum (as an adaptogen) in mandibular fractures.68</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>Animal models of induced ulcers demonstrate protective and healing properties of holy basil extracts and fixed oil. Suggested mechanisms of action include antioxidant effects, lipoxygenase inhibition, histamine antagonism, and antisecretory effects.1, 69, 70, 71, 72</p><p>Conflicting data exist regarding the cardioprotective properties of holy basil extracts. Positive histological and biochemical marker findings have been reported in some animal experiments.73, 74 Reductions in lipid peroxidation have also been demonstrated.59, 75 Clinical trials are lacking.</p><p>In molecular modeling studies, several compounds in O. sanctum have demonstrated significant binding to the odorant binding proteins of Anopheles gambiae, indicating potential use as mosquito repellent.76</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Limited clinical trials are available to provide dosing recommendations for holy basil.</p><h3>CNS disorders</h3><p>300 mg/day of an ethanolic leaf extract for 30 days was used in a study evaluating use of holy basil for enhancement of cognition. Dosages of 1,000 mg/day for 8 weeks or 1,200 mg/day for 6 weeks were used in studies evaluating the effects of holy basil extract on stress disorders.</p><h3>Diabetes/Metabolic syndrome</h3><p>One clinical trial used 2.5 g of the leaves as a dried powder mixed in 200 mL of water daily for 2 months to produce a hypoglycemic effect.63</p><h3>Mandibular fractures</h3><p>O. sanctum 5 mL taken 4 times a day for 4 weeks was used in a clinical study to enhance healing rates.68</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Conflicting data exist regarding the embryotoxicity of O. tenuiflorum, with some experiments in rats showing toxicity at 100 to 200 mg/kg body weight and others showing no toxicity.1 Emmenagogue and abortifacient effects have been reported for the related species O. basilicum.77 Traditional use of holy basil to increase lactation has been recorded, but safety data are lacking.1, 3</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>Case reports are lacking. Potentiation of the sedative effects of barbiturates has been demonstrated in experiments in rats.1, 42 Eugenol was observed to be hepatotoxic in glutathione-depleted mice; therefore, caution is recommended for concomitant use of holy basil with acetaminophen.1</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Data are limited. Few adverse reactions have been noted in clinical studies.49, 50, 63</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Clinical information is limited. Reversible inhibition of spermatogenesis and decreased total sperm count and motility have been demonstrated in rodents administered high doses of O. tenuiflorum extracts.78, 79 In one study evaluating the acute oral toxicity and mutagenic potential of O. tenuiflorum, no treatment-related effects were reported;80 however, other toxicity studies report no biochemical, hematological, or histopathological changes at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day of an ethanolic leaf extract.81, 82</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Ocimum basilicum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum campechianum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum canum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum gratissimum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum sanctum</i></li><li>African Basil</li><li>Amazonian Basil</li><li>Hoary Basil</li><li>Sweet Basil</li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
