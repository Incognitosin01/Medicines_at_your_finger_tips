Having a high temperature can increase the amount of drug you absorb through your skin.</p><p><b>If you use opioid medicine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug.</b> This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p><b>Do not breastfeed</b> while you are using fentanyl.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use  Duragesic-100?</h2><p><b>Stop</b> using all other around-the-clock opioid medications.</p><p>Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use fentanyl in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to use more of  Duragesic-100. Never use a skin patch if it has been cut or damaged.</p><p><b>Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.</p><p>Do not allow the skin patch to come into contact with your mouth, eyes, nose, or lips, or another person's skin.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.</p><p>Wear the fentanyl skin patch around the clock, removing and replacing the patch every 72 hours (3 days). Do not wear more than 1 patch at a time unless your doctor has told you to.</p><p>When placing a skin patch on a young child, choose a wearing area where the child cannot easily remove the patch unsupervised.</p><p>Do not stop using fentanyl suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store each patch in its foil pouch at room temperature.</p><p>Keep both used and unused patches out of the reach of children or pets. <b>The amount of fentanyl in a used skin patch can be fatal to a child or pet who accidentally sucks or chews on the patch.</b> Seek emergency medical attention if this happens.</p><p>After removing a skin patch: fold it in half with the sticky side in, and flush the patch down the toilet right away. Do not place a used skin patch into a trash can.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, dispose of any unused skin patches in the same folded manner. Do not flush the foil pouch or patch liners; place them in a trash container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you are using the skin patches on a schedule, apply the missed patch as soon as you remember. Continue wearing the patch for up to 72 hours and then apply a new one if needed for pain. Do not wear extra patches to make up a missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A fentanyl overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include slow breathing and heart rate, severe drowsiness, muscle weakness, cold and clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, and fainting.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while using  Duragesic-100?</h2><p><b>Avoid sources of heat while you are wearing the patch.</b> Do not use a heating pad or electric blanket, a waterbed heater, tanning bed or sauna. Do not sit in hot water, sunbathe, or raise your body temperature with vigorous activity. <b>Heat can increase the amount of drug you absorb through your skin and may cause an overdose or death.</b></p><p>Grapefruit may interact with fentanyl and lead to unwanted side effects. Avoid the use of grapefruit products.</p><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Avoid wearing a skin patch on a part of your body where a child could reach or remove the patch from your skin. Avoid allowing children to watch you put on a skin patch. Never tell a child that the fentanyl skin patch is a "bandage."</p><p>Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how  Duragesic-100 will affect you.
