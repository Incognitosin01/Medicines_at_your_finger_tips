<li><strong>Prepare the Treatment Site and Device:</strong> Examine the treatment site to ensure that the skin is intact. Clean the site, according to standard practice. Visually inspect the pouch. Do not use if the pouch has been torn, or damaged or if the device has been dropped. Tear open the pouch using the notch provided. Remove Zingo from the pouch, being careful not to touch the purple outlet (open end) to avoid contamination.</li>
<li><strong>Position Zingo:</strong> Grip Zingo and place on the application site, with one hand, or with both hands. Ensure that the patient's treatment site is supported to prevent movement. Seal the purple Zingo outlet against the patient's skin. Hold the device perpendicular to the skin, making sure that your thumb can reach the green start button. Avoid gaps between the skin and the Zingo outlet as gaps will impede drug delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Release the Safety Interlock:</strong> Apply adequate downward pressure to release the safety interlock, while maintaining the seal between Zingo and the skin. Zingo is ready for administration when the green start button has moved into the upward position. Zingo cannot be actuated without releasing the internal safety interlock.</li>
<li><strong>Administer Zingo:</strong> While maintaining downward pressure, administer the dose by pressing the green start button. Do not move Zingo during administration. Actuation is accompanied by a "popping" sound, indicating that the dose has been discharged.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Zingo:</strong> Remove Zingo from the application site and dispose.</li>
<li><strong>Begin Procedure:</strong> Start the venipuncture or intravenous cannulation procedure 1-3 minutes after Zingo administration.</li>
