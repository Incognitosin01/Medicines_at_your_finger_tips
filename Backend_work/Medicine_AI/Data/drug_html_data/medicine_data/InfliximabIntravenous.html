It is used in patients who cannot be treated with other medicines.</p><p>Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that works to enhance and improve the immune system.</p><p>Infliximab is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using infliximab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For infliximab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to infliximab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of infliximab injection for the treatment of <i>Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis</i> in children 6 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 6 years of age.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of infliximab injection in children with <i>ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, or psoriatic arthritis</i>. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have demonstrated that infliximab injection is not helpful in children with <i>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</i>. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of infliximab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have infections, which may require caution in patients receiving infliximab.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving infliximab, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using infliximab with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of infliximab</h2><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you infliximab in a medical facility. It is given through a needle that is placed into one of your veins. It must be given slowly, so the needle will have to remain in place for at least 2 hours.</p><p>Infliximab should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have questions.</p><p>You may also receive other medicines (eg, allergy medicine, fever medicine, steroids) to help prevent possible unwanted effects during the injection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using infliximab</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress closely and at regular visits</i> to make sure that infliximab is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Infliximab may cause an infusion reaction, including a heart attack, stroke, changes in blood pressure, or heart rhythm problems (eg, arrhythmia), while you or your child are receiving it or right after the infusion ends. Check with your doctor or nurse right away if you have chest pain, fever, chills, itching, hives, rash, dizziness, fainting, lightheadedness, headache, joint pain, difficulty with swallowing, trouble breathing, or swelling of the face, tongue, and throat.</p><p>Your body's ability to fight an infection may be reduced while you or your child are using infliximab. It is very important that you call your doctor at the first sign of any infection. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a fever, chills, cough, flu-like symptoms, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Serious skin reactions can occur while you or your child are receiving infliximab. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, chills, cough, diarrhea, fever, itching, joint or muscle pain, red skin lesions, sore throat, sores, ulcers, or white spots in your mouth, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Infliximab may increase your or your child's risk of having a lupus-like syndrome or a liver disease called autoimmune hepatitis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have dark brown-colored urine, fever or chills, a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or weakness, joint pain, light-colored stools, nausea, vomiting, a rash on the cheeks or arms that gets worse under the sun, severe tiredness, upper right-sided stomach pain, or yellow eyes and skin.</p><p>A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used infliximab have developed certain types of cancer. This is more common in patients who have lung diseases (eg, emphysema, COPD) or are heavy smokers, and in psoriasis patients who have had phototherapy treatment for a long time. Phototherapy treatment is ultraviolet light or sunlight combined with oral medicine to make your skin sensitive to light. Some teenagers and young adults with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis also developed a rare type of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, unexplained weight loss, or red, scaly patches, or raised bumps with pus on the skin.</p><p>Receiving infliximab may increase your risk of getting skin cancer (eg, melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma) or cervical cancer. If you have any changes or growths on your skin, abnormal vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>While you are being treated with infliximab, do not have any immunizations (vaccines) without your doctor's approval. <i>Live virus vaccines should not be given with infliximab</i>. Your child's vaccinations must be current before receiving infliximab. Talk to your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.</p><p>Women: If you have a baby while receiving infliximab, make sure the baby's doctor knows that you are receiving infliximab. You will need to wait a few months before giving certain vaccines to your baby. Talk to the baby's doctor if you have questions.</p><p>You will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start receiving infliximab. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>It is important to have your heart checked closely if you receive infliximab. Call your doctor right away if you have trouble breathing, swelling in the ankles and feet, or a sudden weight gain.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), tocilizumab (Actemra®), or other medicines called biologics that are used to treat the same conditions as infliximab. <i>Using these medicines together with infliximab may increase your chance of having serious unwanted effects</i>.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Infliximab side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor or nurse immediately</i> if any of the following side effects occur:</p><p><i>More common</i></p><ul>
