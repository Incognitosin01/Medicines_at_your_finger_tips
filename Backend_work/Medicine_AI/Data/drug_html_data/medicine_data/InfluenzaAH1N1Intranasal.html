Compared to controls, FluMist recipients had a higher rate of sore throat.</p><h3>8.6 Use in Individuals 50-64 Years of Age</h3><p class="First">Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal is not approved for use in individuals 50-64 years of age. In Study AV009, effectiveness of FluMist was not demonstrated in individuals 50-64 years of age (n=641). Solicited adverse events were similar in type and frequency to those reported in younger adults.</p><h2>Influenza A H1N1 Intranasal Description</h2><p class="First">Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal is a live monovalent vaccine for administration by intranasal spray. The influenza virus strain in Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal is (a) <span class="Italics">cold-adapted</span> (<span class="Italics">ca</span>) (i.e., it replicates efficiently at 25<span class="Sup">o</span>C, a temperature that is restrictive for replication of many wild-type influenza viruses); (b) <span class="Italics">temperature-sensitive (ts)</span> (i.e., it is restricted in replication at 39<span class="Sup">o</span>C, a temperature at which many wild-type influenza viruses grow efficiently); and (c) <span class="Italics">attenuated (att)</span> (it does not produce classic influenza-like illness in the ferret model of human influenza infection). The cumulative effect of the antigenic properties and the <span class="Italics">ca</span>, <span class="Italics">ts</span>, and <span class="Italics">att</span> phenotypes is that the attenuated vaccine virus replicates in the nasopharynx to induce protective immunity.</p><p>No evidence of reversion has been observed in the recovered vaccine strains that have been tested (135 of possible 250 recovered isolates) using FluMist <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.5)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>. For the reassortant virus in Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal, the six internal gene segments responsible for <span class="Italics">ca</span>, <span class="Italics">ts</span>, and <span class="Italics">att</span> phenotypes are derived from a master donor virus (MDV), and the two segments that encode the two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are derived from the corresponding antigenically relevant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 wild-type virus. Thus, the virus contained in Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal, maintains the replication characteristics and phenotypic properties of the MDV and expresses the HA and NA of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. For the MDV, at least five genetic loci in three different internal gene segments contribute to the <span class="Italics">ts</span> and <span class="Italics">att</span> phenotypes; five genetic loci in three gene segments control the <span class="Italics">ca</span> property.</p><p>Specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs are inoculated with the reassortant strain and incubated to allow vaccine virus replication. The allantoic fluid of these eggs is harvested, pooled and then clarified by filtration. The virus is concentrated by ultracentrifugation and diluted with stabilizing buffer to obtain the final sucrose and potassium phosphate concentrations. The viral harvests are then sterile filtered to produce monovalent bulks. Each lot is tested for <span class="Italics">ca</span>, <span class="Italics">ts</span>, and <span class="Italics">att</span> phenotypes and is also tested extensively by <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> methods to detect adventitious agents. Monovalent bulks are diluted as required to attain the desired potency with stabilizing buffers. The bulk vaccine is then filled directly into individual sprayers for nasal administration.</p><p>Each pre-filled refrigerated Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal sprayer contains a single 0.2 mL dose. Each 0.2 mL dose contains 10<span class="Sup">6.5-7.5</span> FFU of the live attenuated influenza virus reassortant of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v. Each 0.2 mL dose also contains<span class="Bold"> </span>0.188 mg/dose monosodium glutamate, 2.00 mg/dose hydrolyzed porcine gelatin, 2.42 mg/dose arginine, 13.68 mg/dose sucrose, 2.26 mg/dose dibasic potassium phosphate, 0.96 mg/dose monobasic potassium phosphate, and &lt;0.015 mcg/mL gentamicin sulfate. The vaccine contains no preservatives.</p><p>The tip attached to the sprayer is equipped with a nozzle that produces a fine mist that is primarily deposited in the nose and nasopharynx. Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal is a colorless to pale yellow liquid and is clear to slightly cloudy.</p><h2>Influenza A H1N1 Intranasal - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Immune mechanisms conferring protection against influenza following receipt of FluMist vaccine are not fully understood. Likewise, naturally acquired immunity to wild-type influenza has not been completely elucidated. Serum antibodies, mucosal antibodies and influenza-specific T cells may play a role in prevention and recovery from infection.</p><p>Influenza illness and its complications follow infection with influenza viruses. Global surveillance of influenza identifies yearly antigenic variants. For example, since 1977, antigenic variants of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual change of one or more new strains in each year’s influenza vaccine.</p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Biodistribution</span></p><p>A biodistribution study of intranasally administered radiolabeled placebo was conducted in 7 healthy adult volunteers. The mean percentage of the delivered doses detected were as follows: nasal cavity 89.7%, stomach 2.6%, brain 2.4%, and lung 0.4%. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Neither Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal nor FluMist have been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or potential to impair fertility.</p><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MedImmune’s Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal and the seasonal trivalent Influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal (FluMist) are manufactured by the same process.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Data in this section were obtained in clinical studies conducted with FluMist.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">FluMist, in refrigerated and frozen formulations, was administered to approximately 35,000 subjects in controlled clinical studies. FluMist has been studied in placebo-controlled trials over multiple years, using different vaccine strains.

During the 2004-2005 influenza season, a total number of 3916 children &lt;5 years of age and without severe asthma, without use of bronchodilator or steroids and without wheezing within the prior 6 weeks were randomized to FluMist and 3936 were randomized to active control. Participants were then followed through the influenza season to identify illness caused by influenza virus. As the primary endpoint, culture-confirmed modified CDC-ILI (CDC-defined influenza-like illness) was defined as a positive culture for a wild-type influenza virus associated within ±7 days of modified CDC-ILI. Modified CDC-ILI was defined as fever (temperature ≥100°F oral or equivalent) plus cough, sore throat, or runny nose/nasal congestion on the same or consecutive days.</p><p>In the primary efficacy analysis, FluMist demonstrated a 44.5% (95% CI: 22.4, 60.6) reduction in influenza rate compared to active control as measured by culture-confirmed modified CDC-ILI caused by wild-type strains antigenically similar to those contained in the vaccine.

The primary endpoint of the trial was the prevention of culture-confirmed influenza illness due to antigenically matched wild-type influenza in children, who received two doses of vaccine in the first year and a single revaccination dose in the second year. During the first year of the study 1602 children 15-71 months of age were randomized 2:1 (vaccine:placebo). Approximately 85% of the participants in the first year returned for the second year of the study. In Year 2, children remained in the same treatment group as in year one and received a single dose of FluMist or placebo. See Table 4 for a description of the results.</p><p>During the second year of Study AV006, the primary circulating strain was the A/Sydney/05/97 H3N2 strain, which was antigenically dissimilar from the H3N2 strain represented in the vaccine, A/Wuhan/359/95; FluMist demonstrated 87.0% (95% CI: 77.0, 92.6) efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza illness.</p><h3>14.2 Study in Adults</h3><p class="First">AV009 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness in adults 18-64 years of age without high-risk medical conditions. Participants were randomized 2:1, vaccine:placebo. Cultures for influenza virus were not obtained from subjects in the trial, so that the efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza was not assessed. The A/Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2) strain, which was contained in FluMist, was antigenically distinct from the predominant circulating strain of influenza virus during the trial period, A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2). Type A/Wuhan (H3N2) and Type B strains also circulated in the U.S. during the study period. The primary endpoint of the trial was the reduction in the proportion of participants with one or more episodes of any febrile illness and prospective secondary endpoints were severe febrile illness, and febrile upper respiratory illness. Effectiveness for any of the three endpoints was not demonstrated in a subgroup of adults 50-64 years of age. Primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints from the age group 18-49 years of age are presented in Table 5. Effectiveness was not demonstrated for the primary endpoint in adults 18-49 years of age.   </p><p>Effectiveness was shown in a post-hoc analysis using CDC-ILI in the age group 18-49 years.</p><h3>14.3 Study in Adults with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection</h3><p class="First">Safety and shedding of vaccine virus following FluMist administration were evaluated in 57 HIV-infected [median CD4 cell count of 541 cells/mm3] and 54 HIV-negative adults 18-58 years of age in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial using the frozen formulation. No serious adverse events were reported during the one-month follow-up period. Vaccine strain (type B) virus was detected in 1 of 28 HIV-infected subjects on Day 5 only and none of the HIV-negative FluMist recipients. No adverse effects on HIV viral load or CD4 counts were identified following FluMist. The effectiveness of FluMist in preventing influenza illness in HIV-infected individuals has not been evaluated.</p><h3>14.4 Refrigerated Formulation Study</h3><p class="First">A double-blind, randomized multi-center trial was conducted to evaluate the comparative immunogenicity and safety of refrigerated and frozen formulations of FluMist in individuals 5 to 49 years of age without high risk medical conditions. Nine hundred and eighty-one subjects were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either vaccine formulation. Subjects 5-8 years of age received two doses of study vaccine 46-60 days apart; subjects 9-49 years of age received one dose of study vaccine. The study met its primary endpoint. The GMT ratios of refrigerated and frozen formulations (adjusted for baseline serostatus) for H1N1, H3N2 and B strains, respectively, were 1.24, 1.02 and 1.00 in the two dose group and 1.14, 1.12 and 0.96 in the one dose group.</p><h3>14.5 Transmission Study</h3><p class="First">FluMist contains live attenuated influenza viruses that must infect and replicate in cells lining the nasopharynx of the recipient to induce immunity. Vaccine viruses capable of infection and replication can be cultured from nasal secretions obtained from vaccine recipients. The relationship of viral replication in a vaccine recipient and transmission of vaccine viruses to other individuals has not been established.</p><p>Using the frozen formulation, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in a daycare setting in children &lt;3 years of age to assess the transmission of vaccine viruses from a vaccinated individual to a non-vaccinated individual. A total of 197 children 8-36 months of age were randomized to receive one dose of FluMist (n=98) or placebo (n=99). Virus shedding was evaluated for 21 days by culture of nasal swab specimens. Wild-type A (H3N2) influenza virus was documented to have circulated in the community and in the study population during the trial, whereas Type A (H1N1) and Type B strains did not.</p><p>At least one vaccine strain was isolated from 80% of FluMist recipients; strains were recovered from 1-21 days post vaccination (mean duration of 7.6 days ± 3.4 days). The cold-adapted (<span class="Italics">ca</span>) and temperature-sensitive (<span class="Italics">ts</span>) phenotypes were preserved in 135 tested of 250 strains isolated at the local laboratory. Ten influenza isolates (9 influenza A, 1 influenza B) were cultured from a total of seven placebo subjects. One placebo subject had mild symptomatic Type B virus infection confirmed as a transmitted vaccine virus by a FluMist recipient in the same playgroup. This Type B isolate retained the <span class="Italics">ca</span>, <span class="Italics">ts</span>, and <span class="Italics">att</span> phenotypes of the vaccine strain, and had the same genetic sequence when compared to a Type B virus cultured from a vaccine recipient within the same playgroup. Four of the influenza Type A isolates were confirmed as wild-type A/Panama (H3N2). The remaining isolates could not be further characterized.</p><p>Assuming a single transmission event (isolation of the Type B vaccine strain), the probability of a young child acquiring vaccine virus following close contact with a single FluMist vaccinee in this daycare setting was 0.58% (95% CI: 0, 1.7) based on the Reed-Frost model. With documented transmission of one Type B in one placebo subject and possible transmission of Type A viruses in four placebo subjects, the probability of acquiring a transmitted vaccine virus was estimated to be 2.4% (95% CI: 0.13, 4.6), using the Reed-Frost model.</p><p>The duration of FluMist vaccine virus replication and shedding have not been established.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Live, Intranasal is supplied for intranasal delivery in a package of 10 pre-filled, single-use sprayers.<br/>
