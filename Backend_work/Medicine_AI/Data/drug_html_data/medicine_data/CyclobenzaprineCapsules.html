</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Cyclobenzaprine Capsules</h2><p class="First">Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are indicated as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Improvement is manifested by relief of muscle spasm and its associated signs and symptoms, namely, pain, tenderness, and limitation of motion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><ul>
<li>Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules should be used only for short periods (up to two or three weeks) because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use is not available and because muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions is generally of short duration and specific therapy for longer periods is seldom warranted.</li>
<li>Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules have not been found effective in the treatment of spasticity associated with cerebral or spinal cord disease or in children with cerebral palsy.</li>
</ul><h2>Cyclobenzaprine Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended adult dose for most patients is one (1) cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule 15 mg taken once daily. Some patients may require up to 30 mg/day, given as one (1) cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule 30 mg taken once daily or as two (2) cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 15 mg taken once daily.</p><ul>
<li>It is recommended that doses be taken at approximately the same time each day.</li>
<li>Use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules for periods longer than two or three weeks is not recommended <span class="Italics">[See Indications and Usage (1)]</span> .</li>
</ul><p>Instruct patients to swallow cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules intact. Alternatively, the contents of the cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsule may be sprinkled over applesauce and then swallowed. This method is appropriate only for patients able to reliably swallow the applesauce without chewing. Other foods have not been tested and should not be substituted for applesauce. Instruct the patient to:</p><ul>
<li>Sprinkle the contents of the capsule onto a tablespoon of applesauce and consume immediately without chewing.</li>
<li>Rinse the mouth to ensure all of the contents have been swallowed.</li>
<li>Discard any unused portion of the cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules after the contents have been sprinkled on applesauce.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Extended-release capsules in the following strengths:</p><ul>
<li>15 mg: Hard gelatin capsules with orange opaque body, orange opaque cap, imprinted "APO C15" in white ink and filled with white to off-white, round, biconvex tablets.</li>
<li>30 mg: Hard gelatin capsules with standard red opaque body, dark blue opaque cap, imprinted "APO C30" in white ink and filled with white to off-white, round, biconvex tablets.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><ul>
<li>Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. These adverse reactions may manifest as an anaphylactic reaction, urticaria, facial and/or tongue swelling, or pruritus. Discontinue cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. </li>
<li>Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 14 days after their discontinuation. Hyperpyretic crisis seizures and deaths have occurred in patients receiving cyclobenzaprine (or structurally similar tricyclic antidepressants) concomitantly with MAO inhibitor drugs.</li>
<li>During the acute recovery phase of myocardial infarction, and in patients with arrhythmias, heart block or conduction disturbances, or congestive heart failure.</li>
<li>Hyperthyroidism.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Serotonin Syndrome</h3><p class="First">The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with cyclobenzaprine when used in combination with other drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors. The concomitant use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride with MAO inhibitors is contraindicated <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., confusion, agitation, hallucinations), autonomic instability (e.g., diaphoresis, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., tremor, ataxia, hyperreflexia, clonus, muscle rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Treatment with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above reactions occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. If concomitant treatment with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation is advised, particularly during treatment initiation or dose increases.</p><h3>Tricyclic Antidepressant-like Effects</h3><p class="First">Cyclobenzaprine is structurally related to the tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline and imipramine. Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, prolongation of the conduction time leading to myocardial infarction and stroke <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span><span class="Italics">.</span> Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.</p><p>Some of the more serious central nervous system (CNS) reactions noted with the tricyclic antidepressants have occurred in short-term studies of cyclobenzaprine for indications other than muscle spasm associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions, and usually at doses somewhat greater than those recommended for skeletal muscle spasm. If clinically significant CNS symptoms develop, consider discontinuation of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride.</p><h3>Use in the Elderly</h3><p class="First">As a result of a 40% increase in cyclobenzaprine plasma levels and a 56% increase in plasma half-life following administration of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in elderly subjects as compared to young adults, use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules is not recommended in the elderly <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">As a result of two-fold higher cyclobenzaprine plasma levels in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, as compared to healthy subjects, following administration of immediate-release cyclobenzaprine and because there is limited dosing flexibility with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules is not recommended in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Atropine-like Action</h3><p class="First">Because of its atropine-like action, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules should be used with caution in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and in patients taking anticholinergic medication.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant reactions are described in greater detail, in other sections.</p><p>•   Serotonin Syndrome <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>•   Adverse Cardiovascular Effects <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] </span><br/></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in 253 patients in 2 clinical trials. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were studied in two double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, active-controlled trials of identical design <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. The study population was composed of patients with muscle spasms associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions. Patients received 15 mg or 30 mg of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules taken orally once daily, cyclobenzaprine immediate-release (IR) 10 mg three times a day, or placebo for 14 days.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3% in any treatment group and greater than placebo) were dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, and somnolence (see Table 1).</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 1: Incidence of the Most Common Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 3% of Patients in any Treatment Group* and Greater Than Placebo in the Two Phase 3, Double-Blind Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules Trials</span></p><p>*cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 15 mg QD, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 30 mg QD, or cyclobenzaprine IR tablets TID</p><h3>Post-marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies or post-marketing experience with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, cyclobenzaprine IR, or tricyclic drugs. Because some of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>In a post-marketing surveillance program of cyclobenzaprine IR, the adverse reactions reported most frequently were drowsiness, dry mouth, and dizziness and adverse reactions reported in 1% to 3% of the patients were: fatigue/tiredness, asthenia, nausea, constipation, dyspepsia, unpleasant taste, blurred vision, headache, nervousness, and confusion.</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules or cyclobenzaprine IR), in clinical studies of cyclobenzaprine IR (incidence &lt;1%), or in post-marketing experience with other tricyclic drugs:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole:</span> Syncope; malaise; chest pain; edema.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular:</span> Tachycardia; arrhythmia; vasodilatation; palpitation; hypotension; hypertension; myocardial infarction; heart block; stroke.</p><p><span class="Italics">Digestive:</span> Vomiting; anorexia; diarrhea; gastrointestinal pain; gastritis; thirst; flatulence; edema of the tongue; abnormal liver function and rare reports of hepatitis, jaundice, and cholestasis; paralytic ileus, tongue discoloration; stomatitis; parotid swelling.</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine</span>: Inappropriate ADH syndrome.</p><p><span class="Italics">H</span><span class="Italics">ematologic and Lymphatic:</span> Purpura; bone marrow depression; leukopenia; eosinophilia; thrombocytopenia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hypersensitivity:</span> Anaphylaxis; angioedema; pruritus; facial edema; urticaria; rash.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolic, Nutritional, and Immune:</span> Elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels; weight gain or loss.</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal:</span> Local weakness; myalgia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System and Psychiatric:</span> Seizures, ataxia; vertigo; dysarthria; tremors; hypertonia; convulsions; muscle twitching; disorientation; insomnia; depressed mood; abnormal sensations; anxiety; agitation; psychosis, abnormal thinking and dreaming; hallucinations; excitement; paresthesia; diplopia; serotonin syndrome; neuroleptic malignant syndrome; decreased or increased libido; abnormal gait; delusions; aggressive behavior; paranoia; peripheral neuropathy; Bell’s palsy; alteration in EEG patterns; extrapyramidal symptoms.</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory:</span> Dyspnea.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin:</span> Sweating; photosensitization; alopecia.</p><p>S<span class="Italics">pecial Senses:</span> Ageusia; tinnitus.</p><p><span class="Italics">U</span><span class="Italics">rogenital:</span> Urinary frequency and/or retention; impaired urination; dilatation of urinary tract; impotence; testicular swelling; gynecomastia; breast enlargement; galactorrhea.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Based on its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride may have life-threatening interactions with MAO inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span><span class="Italics">,</span> may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants, may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking tramadol, or may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds.</p><p>Postmarketing cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of cyclobenzaprine and other drugs, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Available data from case reports with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules use in pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In rats, decreased pup body weight and survival was noted at cyclobenzaprine doses ≥10 mg/kg/day (approximately ≥3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day), when administered orally during pregnancy and lactation <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>No adverse embryofetal effects were reported following oral administration of cyclobenzaprine during organogenesis to mice and rabbits at maternal doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 and 15 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). Maternal toxicity characterized by decreased body weight gain was observed only in mice at the highest tested dose of 20 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Decreased pup body weight and survival were reported in a prenatal and postnatal study where pregnant rats were treated orally with cyclobenzaprine during pregnancy and lactation with maternal doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 and 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2 </span>basis). Maternal toxicity, characterized by a decreased body weight gain, was observed only at the highest tested dose of 20 mg/kg/day.  <br/></p><h3>8.2 Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of cyclobenzaprine in either human or animal milk, the effects on a breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules has not been studied in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine the safety and efficacy of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in the elderly population. The plasma concentration and half-life of cyclobenzaprine are substantially increased in the elderly when compared to the general patient population. Accordingly, use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules is not recommended in the elderly <span class="Italics"><span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics"></span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Pharmacologic similarities among the tricyclic drugs require that certain withdrawal symptoms be considered when cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is administered, even though they have not been reported to occur with this drug.  Abrupt cessation of treatment after prolonged administration rarely may produce nausea, headache, and malaise.  These are not indicative of addiction.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><h3>Manifestations</h3><p class="First">Although rare, deaths may occur from overdosage with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate cyclobenzaprine overdose. <span class="Bold">As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment</span>. Signs and symptoms of toxicity may develop rapidly after cyclobenzaprine overdose; therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible.</p><p><br/>
The most common effects associated with cyclobenzaprine overdose are drowsiness and tachycardia.  Less frequent manifestations include tremor, agitation, coma, ataxia, hypertension, slurred speech, confusion, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and hallucinations.  Rare but potentially critical manifestations of overdose are cardiac arrest, chest pain, cardiac dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  Changes in the electrocardiogram, particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of cyclobenzaprine toxicity.  Other potential effects of overdosage include any of the symptoms listed under <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span>.</p><h3>Management</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p><span class="Bold">As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment.</span></p><p>In order to protect against the rare but potentially critical manifestations described above, obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring.  Protect the patient’s airway, establish an intravenous line, and initiate gastric decontamination.  Observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or respiratory depression, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias and/or conduction blocks, and seizures is necessary.  If signs of toxicity occur at any time during this period, extended monitoring is required.  Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide management of the patient.  Dialysis is probably of no value because of low plasma concentrations of the drug. </p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Decontamination</span></p><p>All patients suspected of an overdose with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules should receive gastrointestinal decontamination.  This should include large volume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal.  If consciousness is impaired, the airway should be secured prior to lavage and emesis is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular</span></p><p>A maximal limb-lead QRS duration of 0.10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the overdose.  Serum alkalinization, to a pH of 7.45 to 7.55, using intravenous sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation (as needed), should be instituted for patients with dysrhythmias and/or QRS widening.  A pH &gt;7.60 or a pCO<span class="Sub">2</span> &lt;20 mmHg is undesirable.  Dysrhythmias unresponsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine, bretylium, or phenytoin.  Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide).</p><p><span class="Bold">CNS</span></p><p>In patients with CNS depression, early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration.  Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines or, if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin).  Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat life-threatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other therapies, and then only in close consultation with a poison control center.</p><p><span class="Bold">Psychiatric Follow-Up</span></p><p>Since overdosage is often deliberate, patients may attempt suicide by other means during the recovery phase.  Psychiatric referral may be appropriate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Management</span></p><p>The principles of management of child and adult overdosage are similar.  It is strongly recommended that the physician contact the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.</p><h2>Cyclobenzaprine Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, USP are a skeletal muscle relaxant which relieves muscle spasm of local origin without interfering with muscle function. The active ingredient in cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules is cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, USP. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (HCl) is a white to off-white powder with the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">20</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>N·HCl and a molecular weight of 311.85 g/mole.  It has a melting point of 216 to 218 °C, and a pK<span class="Sub">a</span> of 8.47 at 25°C.  It is freely soluble in water and alcohol, sparingly soluble in isopropanol, and insoluble in hydrocarbon solvents. If aqueous solutions are made alkaline, the free base separates.

Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules contain the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, hypromellose acetate succinate and magnesium stearate. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 15 mg also contain D&amp;C Yellow #10, FD&amp;C Green #3, FD&amp;C Red #40, gelatin and titanium dioxide.  The capsule imprinting ink contains povidone, propylene glycol, shellac, sodium hydroxide and titanium dioxide. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 30 mg also contain FD&amp;C Blue #1, FD&amp;C Blue #2, FD&amp;C Red #40, FD&amp;C Yellow #6, gelatin and titanium dioxide.  The capsule imprinting ink contains  povidone, propylene glycol, shellac, sodium hydroxide and titanium dioxide.</p><p>USP Dissolution Test Pending.</p><h2>Cyclobenzaprine Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Cyclobenzaprine relieves skeletal muscle spasm of local origin without interfering with muscle function. Cyclobenzaprine has not been shown to be effective in muscle spasm due to central nervous system disease. In animal models, cyclobenzaprine reduced or abolished skeletal muscle hyperactivity. Animal studies indicate that cyclobenzaprine does not act at the neuromuscular junction or directly on skeletal muscle. Such studies show  that cyclobenzaprine acts primarily within the central nervous system at the brain stem as opposed to the spinal cord level, although an overlapping action on the latter may contribute to its overall skeletal muscle relaxant activity. Evidence suggests that the net effect of cyclobenzaprine is a reduction of tonic somatic motor activity, influencing both gamma (γ) and alpha (α) motor systems. Pharmacological studies in animals demonstrated a similarity between the effects of cyclobenzaprine and the structurally related tricyclic antidepressants, including reserpine antagonism, norepinephrine potentiation, potent peripheral and central anticholinergic effects, and sedation. Cyclobenzaprine caused slight to moderate increase in heart rate in animals.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following single-dose administration of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 15 mg and 30 mg in healthy adult subjects (n=15)<span class="Italics">,</span> C<span class="Sub">max,</span> AUC<span class="Sub">0-168h</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner from 15 mg to 30 mg. The time to peak plasma cyclobenzaprine concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 7 to 8 hours for both doses of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules.</p><p>A food effect study conducted in healthy adult subjects (n=15)  utilizing a single dose of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 30 mg demonstrated a statistically significant increase in bioavailability when cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 30 mg was given with food relative to the fasted state. There was a 35%  increase in peak plasma cyclobenzaprine concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and a 20% increase in exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">0-168h</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span>) in the presence of food. No effect, however, was noted in T<span class="Sub">max</span> or the shape of the mean plasma cyclobenzaprine concentration versus time profile. Cyclobenzaprine in plasma was first detectable in both the fed and fasted states at 1.5 hours.</p><p>When the contents of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were administered by sprinkling on applesauce, it was found to be bioequivalent to the same dose when administered as an intact capsule.</p><p>In a multiple-dose study utilizing cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 30 mg administered once daily for 7 days in a group of healthy adult subjects (n=35),  a 2.5-fold accumulation of plasma cyclobenzaprine levels was noted at steady-state.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>Cyclobenzaprine is extensively metabolized and is excreted primarily as glucuronides via the kidney.  Cytochromes P-450 3A4, 1A2, and, to a lesser extent, 2D6, mediate N-demethylation, one of the oxidative pathways for cyclobenzaprine.  Cyclobenzaprine has an elimination half-life of 32 hours (range 8-37 hours; n=18); plasma clearance is 0.7 L/min following single-dose administration of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Elderly</span></p><p>Although there were no notable differences in C<span class="Sub">max</span> or T<span class="Sub">max</span>, cyclobenzaprine plasma AUC is increased by 40% and the plasma half-life of cyclobenzaprine is prolonged in elderly subjects greater than 65 years of age (50 hours) after dosing with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules compared to younger subjects 18 to 45 years of age (32 hours).  Pharmacokinetic characteristics of cyclobenzaprine following multiple-dose administration of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in the elderly were not evaluated.</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>In a pharmacokinetic study of immediate-release cyclobenzaprine in 16 subjects with hepatic impairment (15 mild, 1 moderate per Child-Pugh score), both AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were approximately double the values seen in the healthy control group. The pharmacokinetics of cyclobenzaprine in subjects with severe hepatic impairment is not known.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p><br/>
Long-term studies were conducted in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats with oral cyclobenzaprine to evaluate its carcinogenic potential. In an 81-week carcinogenicity study, metastatic hemangiosarcoma was seen in 3 of 21 male mice at 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In a 105-week carcinogenicity study, malignant astrocytoma was seen in 3 of 50 male rats at 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis).
