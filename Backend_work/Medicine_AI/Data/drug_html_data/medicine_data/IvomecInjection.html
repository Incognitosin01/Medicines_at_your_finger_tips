One low-volume dose effectively treats and controls the following internal and external parasites that may impair the health of cattle and swine: gastrointestinal roundworms (including inhibited <span class="Italics">Ostertagia ostertagi</span> in cattle), lungworms, grubs, sucking lice, and mange mites of cattle; and gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, lice, and mange mites of swine. Discovered and developed by scientists from Merck Research Laboratories, ivermectin is a novel chemical entity. Its convenience, broadspectrum efficacy, and safety margin make Ivomec Injection a unique product for parasite control of cattle and swine.</p><h2>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a family of potent, broadspectrum antiparasitic agents isolated from fermentation of <span class="Italics">Streptomyces avermitilis</span>.</p><p>Ivomec Injection is a clear, ready-to-use, sterile solution containing 1% ivermectin, 40% glycerol formal, and propylene glycol, q.s. ad 100%. Ivomec Injection is formulated to deliver the recommended dose level of 200 mcg ivermectin/kilogram of body weight in cattle when given subcutaneously at the rate of 1 mL/110 lb (50 kg). In Swine, Ivomec Injection is formulated to deliver the recommended dose level of 300 mcg ivermectin/kilogram body weight when given subcutaneously in the neck at the rate of 1 mL per 75 lb (33 kg).</p><h2>MODE OF ACTION</h2><p class="First">Ivermectin is a member of the macrocyclic lactone class of endectocides which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligandgated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p><p>The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macro-cyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligandgated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><h3>Cattle</h3><p class="First">Ivomec Injection is indicated for the effective treatment and control of the following harmful species of gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, grubs, sucking lice, and mange mites in cattle:</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Roundworms</span> (adults and fourth-stage larvae):</p><p><span class="Italics">Ostertagia ostertagi</span> (including inhibited <span class="Italics">O. ostertagi</span>)<br/>

Each mL of IVOMEC contains 10 mg of ivermectin, sufficient to treat 110 lb (50 kg) of body weight (maximum 10 mL per injection site).</p><h3>Swine</h3><p class="First">Ivomec Injection should be given only by subcutaneous injection in the neck of swine at the recommended dose level of 300 mcg of ivermectin per kilogram (2.2 lb) of body weight. Each mL of IVOMEC contains 10 mg of ivermectin, sufficient to treat 75 lb of body weight.</p><h2>ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Cattle</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ivomec Injection is to be given subcutaneously only, to reduce risk of potentially fatal clostridial infection of the injection site.</span> Animals should be appropriately restrained to achieve the proper route of administration. Use of a 16-gauge, 1/2 to 3/4" needle is suggested. Inject under the loose skin in front of or behind the shoulder (see illustration).</p><p>When using the 200, 500 or 1000 mL pack size, use only automatic syringe equipment.</p><p>Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant. Clean, properly disinfected needles should be used to reduce the potential for injection site infections.</p><p>No special handling or protective clothing is necessary.</p><h3>Swine</h3><p class="First">IVOMEC<span class="Sup">®</span> (ivermectin) Injection is to be given subcutaneously in the neck. Animals should be appropriately restrained to achieve the proper route of administration. Use of a 16- or 18-gauge needle is suggested for sows and boars, while an 18- or 20-gauge needle may be appropriate for young animals. Inject under the skin, immediately behind the ear (see illustration).</p><p>When using the 200 mL, 500 mL or 1000 mL pack size, use only automatic syringe equipment. As with any injection, sterile equipment should be used. The injection site should be cleaned and disinfected with alcohol before injection. The rubber stopper should also be disinfected with alcohol to prevent contamination of the contents. Mild and transient pain reactions may be seen in some swine following subcutaneous administration.</p><h2>Recommended Treatment Program</h2><h3>Swine</h3><p class="First">At the time of initiating any parasite control program, it is important to treat all breeding animals in the herd. After the initial treatment, use Ivomec Injection regularly as follows:</p><h2>BREEDING ANIMALS</h2><h3>Sows</h3><p class="First">Treat prior to farrowing, preferably 7–14 days before, to minimize infection of piglets.</p><h3>Gilts</h3><p class="First">Treat 7–14 days prior to breeding.<br/>
Treat 7–14 days prior to farrowing.</p><h3>Boars</h3><p class="First">Frequency and need for treatments are dependent upon exposure. Treat at least two times a year.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">FEEDER PIGS<br/>
(Weaners/Growers/Finishers)</span></p><p>All weaner/feeder pigs should be treated before placement in clean quarters.</p><p>Pigs exposed to contaminated soil or pasture may need retreatment if reinfection occurs.</p><p><span class="Bold">NOTE:</span></p><h2>Special Minor Use</h2><h3>Reindeer</h3><p class="First">For the treatment and control of warbles (<span class="Italics">Oedemagena tarandi</span>) in reindeer, inject 200 micrograms ivermectin per kilogram of body weight, subcutaneously. Follow use directions for cattle as described under ADMINISTRATION.</p><h3>American Bison</h3><p class="First">For the treatment and control of grubs (<span class="Italics">Hypoderma bovis</span>) in American bison, inject 200 micrograms ivermectin per kilogram of body weight, subcutaneously. Follow use directions for cattle as described under ADMINISTRATION.</p><h2>RESIDUE WARNING</h2><p class="First">Do not treat reindeer or American bison within 8 weeks (56 days) of slaughter.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOT FOR USE IN HUMANS.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children.</span></p><p>The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information. To report adverse effects, obtain an MSDS or for assistance, contact Merial at 1-888-637-4251.</p><h2>RESIDUE WARNING</h2><p class="First">Do not treat cattle within 35 days of slaughter. Because a withdrawal time in milk has not been established, do not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal. Do not treat swine within 18 days of slaughter.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Transitory discomfort has been observed in some cattle following subcutaneous administration. A low incidence of soft tissue swelling at the injection site has been observed. These reactions have disappeared without treatment. For cattle, divide doses greater than 10 mL between two injection sites to reduce occasional discomfort or site reaction. Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant. Clean, properly disinfected needles should be used to reduce the potential for injection site infections.</p><p>Observe cattle for injection site reactions. Reactions may be due to clostridial infection and should be aggressively treated with appropriate antibiotics. If injection site infections are suspected, consult your veterinarian.</p><p>This product is not for intravenous or intramuscular use.</p><p>Protect product from light.</p><p>Ivomec Injection for Cattle and Swine has been developed specifically for use in cattle, swine, reindeer, and American bison <span class="Bold">only</span>. This product should not be used in other animal species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may result.</p><p>Restricted Drug (California) - use only as directed.</p><h3>When to Treat Cattle with Grubs</h3><p class="First">IVOMEC effectively controls all stages of cattle grubs. However, proper timing of treatment is important. For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after the end of the heel fly (warble fly) season. Destruction of <span class="Italics">Hypoderma</span> larvae (cattle grubs) at the period when these grubs are in vital areas may cause undesirable host-parasite reactions including the possibility of fatalities. Killing <span class="Italics">Hypoderma lineatum</span> when it is in the tissue surrounding the esophagus (gullet) may cause salivation and bloat; killing <span class="Italics">H. bovis</span> when it is in the vertebral canal may cause staggering or paralysis. These reactions are not specific to treatment with IVOMEC, but can occur with any successful treatment of grubs. Cattle should be treated either before or after these stages of grub development. Consult your veterinarian concerning the proper time for treatment. Cattle treated with IVOMEC after the end of the heel fly season may be retreated with IVOMEC during the winter for internal parasites, mange mites, or sucking lice without danger of grub-related reactions. A planned parasite control program is recommended.</p><h3>Environmental Safety</h3><p class="First">Studies indicate that when ivermectin comes in contact with soil, it readily and tightly binds to the soil and becomes inactive over time. Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish and certain aquatic organisms. Do not permit water runoff from feed lots to enter lakes, streams or ponds. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by improper disposal of drug containers. Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration.</p><p>As with other avermectins, ivermectin is excreted in the dung of treated animals and can inhibit the reproduction and growth of pest and beneficial insects that use dung as a source of food and for reproduction. The magnitude and duration of such effects are species and life-cycle specific. When used according to label directions, the product is not expected to have an adverse impact on populations of dung-dependent insects.</p><h2>How is Ivomec Injection Supplied</h2><p class="First">Ivomec Injection for Cattle and Swine is available in four ready-to-use pack sizes:</p><p>The 50 mL pack is a multiple-dose, rubber-capped bottle.
