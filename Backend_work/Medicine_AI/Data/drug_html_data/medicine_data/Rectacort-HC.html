Absorption of hydrocortisone acetate may vary across abraded or inflamed surfaces.

<br/>
Carcinogenesis: No long term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of corticosteroid suppositories.<br/>
<br/>

There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Hydrocortisone acetate suppositories should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time.<br/>
