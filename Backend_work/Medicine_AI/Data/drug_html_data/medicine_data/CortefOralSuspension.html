</ul><h2>Cortef Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">Cortef Oral Suspension contains hydrocortisone cypionate which is a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are adrenocortical steroids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, which are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrocortisone cypionate is the water-insoluble cypionate ester of hydrocortisone. It is both tasteless and odorless, and by the oral route and in equimolar doses, is equivalent to hydrocortisone free alcohol in biologic activity (rat liver-glycogen assay). Determinations of plasma and urinary 17-hydroxycorticoid levels in man following oral administration indicate that this ester is as efficiently absorbed and metabolized as the free alcohol.</p><p>The chemical name for hydrocortisone cypionate is pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione,21-(3-cyclopentyl-1-oxopropoxy)-11,17-dihydroxy-,(11Î²)- and the molecular weight is 486.65. The structural formula is represented below:</p><p>CORTEF, a preparation for oral use, contains 13.4 mg hydrocortisone cypionate (equivalent to 10 mg hydrocortisone) in each 5 mL. CORTEF also contains the following inactive ingredients: benzoic acid, citric acid, FD&amp;C yellow #6 as a color additive, flavors, glycerin, methylparaben, propylparaben, sucrose, xanthan gum NF food grade, and purified water. CORTEF is stable at room temperature. The pH is within a range of 2.8 to 3.2.</p><h2>ACTIONS</h2><p class="First">Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.</p><p>Glucocorticoids cause profound and varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Cortef Oral Suspension is indicated in the following conditions:</p><h3>1.

There may be decreased resistance and inability to localize infection when corticosteroids are used. Infections with any pathogen including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan or helminthic infections, in any location of the body, may be associated with the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents that affect cellular immunity, humoral immunity, or neutrophil function.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>These infections may be mild, but can be severe and at times fatal. With increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses.</p><h3>Usage in pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of childbearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.</p><p>Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.</p><p>Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered to patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. Indicated immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients receiving nonimmunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids.</p><p>The use of Cortef Oral Suspension in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen.</p><p>If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis.</p><p>Persons who are on drugs which suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chicken pox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Similarly, corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General Precautions</h3><p class="First">Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.</p><p>There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis.</p><p>Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation.</p><p>The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.</p><p>Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.</p><p>Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis.</p><p>Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.</p><p>Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical remission.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic interactions listed below are potentially clinically important. Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of corticosteroids and may require increases in corticosteroid dose to achieve the desired response. Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids and thus decrease their clearance. Therefore, the dose of corticosteroid should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Corticosteroids may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. The effect of corticosteroids on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulants when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.</p><h3>Information for the Patient</h3><p class="First">Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances</h3><p class="First">Sodium retention<br/>

This provides a daily dosage of 26.8 mg to 321.6 mg of hydrocortisone cypionate, equivalent in activity to 20 to 240 mg of hydrocortisone. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, CORTEF should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. <span class="Bold">IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.</span> After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of CORTEF for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.</p><h3>Resuspension of Product</h3><p class="First">Shake well before dispensing and before each use, until all visible sediment in the bottle is resuspended. This may require 5 to 7 minutes of shaking before the first use. Subsequent uses from the same bottle will require shaking for significantly less time to resuspend the sediment.</p><h2>How is Cortef Oral Suspension Supplied</h2><p class="First">Cortef Oral Suspension is available in four fluidounce bottles (NDC 0009-0142-01).</p><p>Each 5 mL contains 13.4 mg hydrocortisone cypionate (equivalent to 10 mg hydrocortisone).</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Sup">1</span> Fekety R.
