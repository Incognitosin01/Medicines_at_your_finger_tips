</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>In November 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health warning regarding phenylpropanolamine (PPA) due to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The FDA, supported by results of a research program, requested that manufacturers voluntarily discontinue marketing products that contain PPA and that consumers work with their healthcare providers to select alternative products.</p><p>Antihistamine, decongestant, and anticholinergic combinations are used to treat the nasal congestion (stuffy nose) and runny nose caused by allergies and/or the common cold.</p><p>Antihistamines work by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body. Histamine can cause itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. The antihistamine contained in these combinations is chlorpheniramine.</p><p>The decongestants in these combinations, phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine produce a narrowing of blood vessels. This leads to clearing of nasal congestion, but it may also cause an increase in blood pressure in patients who have high blood pressure.</p><p>Anticholinergics, such as atropine, hyoscyamine, methscopolamine, and scopolamine may help produce a drying effect in the nose and chest.</p><p>Some of these medicines are available without a prescription.</p><p><i>Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 4 years of age.</i> Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Very young children are usually more sensitive than adults to the effects of this medicine. Increases in blood pressure, nightmares or unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in children. Also, when anticholinergics are given to children during hot weather, a rapid increase in body temperature may occur, which may lead to heat stroke. In infants and children, especially those with spastic paralysis or brain damage, this medicine may be especially likely to cause severe side effects.</p><p><i>Do not give any over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicine to a baby or child under 4 years of age.</i> Using these medicines in very young children might cause serious or possibly life-threatening side effects .</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Confusion or memory loss, difficult and painful urination, dizziness, drowsiness, dryness of mouth, or convulsions (seizures) may be more likely to occur in the elderly, who are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of this medicine. Also, nightmares or unusual excitement, nervousness, restlessness, or irritability may be more likely to occur in elderly patients. In addition, eye pain may occur, which may be a sign of glaucoma.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>For the individual ingredients of these combinations, the following apply:</p><ul>
<li>Antihistamines—Antihistamines have not been shown to cause problems in humans.</li>
<li>Atropine—Studies on effects in pregnancy have not been done in humans. Atropine has not been shown to cause birth defects or other problems in animals.</li>
<li>Hyoscyamine—Studies on effects in pregnancy have not been done in either humans or animals.</li>
<li>Methscopolamine—Studies on effects in pregnancy have not been done in either humans or animals.</li>
<li>Phenylephrine—Studies on birth defects have not been done in either humans or animals.</li>
<li>Pseudoephedrine—Studies on birth defects have not been done in humans. Pseudoephedrine has not been shown to cause birth defects in animal studies. However, studies in animals have shown that pseudoephedrine causes a reduction in average weight, length, and rate of bone formation in the animal fetus.</li>
<li>Scopolamine—Studies on effects in pregnancy have not been done in pregnant women. However, studies in animals at doses many times the human dose have shown that scopolamine causes a small increase in the number of fetal deaths.</li>

Use is not recommended since this medicine may cause side effects, such as unusual excitement or irritability, in the nursing baby.
