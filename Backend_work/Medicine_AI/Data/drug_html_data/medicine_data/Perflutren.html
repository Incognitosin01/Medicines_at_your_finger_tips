Perflutren works by changing the way ultrasound waves travel within your heart. This helps the ultrasound portray a sharper image of your heart.</p><p>Perflutren is used to allow certain segments of the heart to be seen more clearly on an echocardiogram.</p><p>Perflutren may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not be treated with perflutren if you have a genetic heart condition called "cardiac shunt."</p><p>In rare cases, serious or fatal reactions may occur during the injection or shortly afterward. Tell your caregiver right away if you feel dizzy, nauseated, light-headed or short of breath, or if you have a severe headache, pounding in your ears, chest pain, fast or slow heartbeats, wheezing, or shallow breathing.</p><p>You may be more likely to have a serious reaction if you have severe or uncontrolled heart problems (congestive heart failure, a recent heart attack, serious heart rhythm disorder).</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not be treated with perflutren if you are allergic to it, or if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a genetic heart condition called "cardiac shunt"; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you are allergic to blood products or to a medicine that contains albumin.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>a genetic heart condition called "cardiac shunt"; or</p><p>if you are allergic to blood products or to a medicine that contains albumin.</p><p>To make sure perflutren is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a congenital heart defect;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a lung condition that has recently become worse; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have ever had an allergic reaction during a blood transfusion.</p>

</ul><p>a congenital heart defect;</p><p>a lung condition that has recently become worse; or</p><p>if you have ever had an allergic reaction during a blood transfusion.</p><p>It is not known whether  perflutren will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</p><p>It is not known whether perflutren passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. However, if you are breast-feeding a baby, <b>use a breast pump to empty your milk supply one time after you are treated with perflutren.</b> Throw out the milk you collect during this time and do not feed it to your baby.</p><p>Perflutren is made from human plasma (part of the blood) which may contain viruses and other infectious agents. Donated plasma is tested and treated to reduce the risk of it containing infectious agents, but there is still a small possibility it could transmit disease. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medication.</p><h2>How is perflutren given?</h2><p>Perflutren is injected into a vein through an IV. A healthcare provider will give you this injection just before the start of your echocardiogram.</p><p>Your heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and other vital signs will be watched closely for at least 30 minutes after you receive perflutren. This is to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction to the medicine.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since perflutren is given with an echocardiogram, you will not be on a regular dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  perflutren is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving perflutren?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Perflutren side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives, skin redness, itching; warmth, redness, numbness, or tingly feeling; wheezing, trouble breathing, tight feeling in your chest or throat; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>In rare cases, serious or fatal reactions may occur during the injection or shortly afterward. <b>Tell your caregivers right away if you have:</b></p><ul>
