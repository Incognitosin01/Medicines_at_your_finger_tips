Some people lack this enzyme because of a genetic disorder. Elosulfase alfa helps replace this missing enzyme in such people.</p><p>Elosulfase alfa is used to treat some of the symptoms of a genetic condition called mucopolysaccharidosis (MYOO-koe-pol-ee-SAK-a-rye-DOE-sis) IV (4) type A, or MPS IV A, also called Morquio A syndrome.</p><p>MPS IVA is a metabolic disorder in which the body lacks the enzyme needed to break down certain natural substances. These substances can build up in the body, causing enlarged organs, abnormal bone structure, changes in facial features, breathing problems, heart problems, vision or hearing loss, and changes in mental or physical abilities.</p><p>Elosulfase alfa may improve walking and stair-climbing ability in people with this condition. However, <b>this medication is not a cure for MPS IVA.</b></p><p>Elosulfase alfa may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>An allergic reaction may occur during or shortly after infusion of  elosulfase alfa. <b>Tell your caregivers or get emergency medical help right away if you have any signs of a severe allergic reaction,</b> such as chest discomfort, cough, trouble breathing, vomiting, skin rash or redness, pale skin, blue lips or fingernails, and feeling like you might pass out.</p><p>You may be more likely to have a reaction to elosulfase alfa if you have a breathing disorder, or if you are sick with a fever at the time of your infusion.</p><p>You will be watched closely after receiving elosulfase alfa, to make sure you do not have an allergic reaction.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Your elosulfase alfa infusion may be delayed if you have a fever or cold symptoms.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

However, MPS symptoms can get worse during pregnancy and may cause medical problems in both mother and baby. The benefit of treating MPS may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>Your name may need to be listed on a Morquio A Registry while you are using this medicine. The purpose of this registry is to track the progression of this disorder and the effects that elosulfase alfa has on long-term treatment of Morquio A syndrome.
