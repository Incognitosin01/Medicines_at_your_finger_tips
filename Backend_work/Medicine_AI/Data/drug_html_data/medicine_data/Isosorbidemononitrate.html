It does not work fast enough to relieve the pain of an angina attack that has already started.</p><p>Isosorbide mononitrate belongs to the group of medicines called nitrates. It works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload. When used regularly on a long-term basis, this helps prevent angina attacks from occurring.</p><p>Isosorbide mononitrate is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using isosorbide mononitrate</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For isosorbide mononitrate, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to isosorbide mononitrate or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of isosorbide mononitrate in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of isosorbide mononitrate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have severe low blood pressure and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving isosorbide mononitrate.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking isosorbide mononitrate, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using isosorbide mononitrate with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
<li>Avanafil</li>
<li>Riociguat</li>
<li>Sildenafil</li>
<li>Tadalafil</li>
<li>Vardenafil</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of isosorbide mononitrate. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Allergy to nitrates (eg, amyl nitrate, butyl nitrate) and nitrites—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Congestive heart failure or</li>
<li>Heart attack, recent or</li>
<li>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a heart disease) or</li>
<li>Hypotension (low blood pressure) or</li>
<li>Hypovolemia (low amount of blood)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of isosorbide mononitrate</h2><p><i>Take isosorbide mononitrate exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>This form of nitrate is used to reduce the number of angina attacks over a long time. It will not relieve an attack that has already started because it works too slowly. The <i>extended-release</i> form gradually releases medicine to provide its effect for 8 to 10 hours. Check with your doctor if you also need a fast-acting medicine to relieve the pain of an angina attack.</p><p>You should take isosorbide mononitrate first thing in the morning and follow the same schedule each day. Isosorbide mononitrate works best if you have a "drug-free" period of time every day when you do not take it. Your doctor will schedule your doses during the day to allow for a drug-free time. Follow the schedule of dosing carefully so the medicine will work properly.</p><p>Swallow the <i>extended-release tablet</i> whole with a half glass of water. Do not split, crush, or chew it.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of isosorbide mononitrate will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of isosorbide mononitrate. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Also, use extra care during exercise or hot weather or if you must stand for long periods of time</i>.</p><p><i>Do not stop using isosorbide mononitrate without checking first with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.</p><p>Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using isosorbide mononitrate.
