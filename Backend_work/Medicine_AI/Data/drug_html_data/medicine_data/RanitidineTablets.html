</ul><h2>Ranitidine Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">The active ingredient in Ranitidine Tablets USP, 150 mg and Ranitidine Tablets USP, 300 mg is ranitidine hydrochloride (HCl) USP, a histamine H2-receptor antagonist. Chemically it is N[2-[[[5-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-2-furanyl]methyl]thio]ethyl]-N′-methyl-2-nitro-1,1-ethenediamine, HCl. It has the following structue:</p><p></p><p>The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>N<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">3</span>S•HCl, representing a molecular weight of 350.87.<br/>
Ranitidine HCl is a white to pale yellow, granular substance that is soluble in water. It has a slightly bitter taste and sulfur like odor.</p><p>Each Ranitidine Tablet USP, 150 mg for oral administration contains 168 mg of ranitidine HCl equivalent to 150 mg of ranitidine. Each tablet also contains the inactive ingredients Colloidal Silicon Dioxide (Aerosil 200 NF), Croscarmellose Sodium NF (Ac-Di-Sol), FD&amp;C Yellow #6/ Sunset Yellow FCF Aluminium Lake, glyceryl monostearate, Iron oxide yellow, Magnesium stearate NF (Ligamed MF-2-V), Microcrystalline Cellulose NF (Avicel PH-112), Polyvinyl alcohol,Purified Water USP, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Talc and Titanium Dioxide.</p><p>Each Ranitidine Tablet USP, 300 mg for oral administration contains 336 mg of ranitidine HCl equivalent to 300 mg of ranitidine. Each tablet also contains the inactive ingredients Colloidal Silicon Dioxide (Aerosil 200 NF), Croscarmellose Sodium NF (Ac-Di-Sol), D&amp;C Yellow # 10 Aluminium Lake, Glyceryl monostearate, Magnesium stearate NF (Ligamed MF-2-V), Microcrystalline Cellulose NF (Avicel PH-112), Polyvinyl alcohol, Purified Water USP, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Talc and Titanium Dioxide.</p><h2>Ranitidine Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Ranitidine Tablets, USP is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of the action of histamine at the histamine H<span class="Sub">2</span>-receptors, including receptors on the gastric cells. Ranitidine Tablets, USP does not lower serum Ca<span class="Sup">++</span> in hypercalcemic states. Ranitidine Tablets, USP is not an anticholinergic agent.</p><h2>Pharmacokinetics:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span></span> Ranitidine Tablets, USP is 50% absorbed after oral administration, compared to an intravenous (IV) injection with mean peak levels of 440 to 545 ng/mL occurring 2 to 3hours after a 150-mg dose. Absorption is not significantly impaired by the administration of food or antacids. Propantheline slightly delays and increases peak blood levels of ranitidine, probably by delaying gastric emptying and transit time. In one study, simultaneous administration of high-potency antacid (150 mmol) in fasting subjects has been reported to decrease the absorption of Ranitidine Tablets, USP.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Distribution:</span></span> The volume of distribution is about 1.4L/Kg. Serum protein binding averages 15 %.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Metabolism:</span></span> In humans, the N-oxide is the principal metabolite in the urine; however, this amounts to &lt;4% of the dose. Other metabolites are the S-oxide (1%) and the desmethyl ranitidine (1%). The remainder of the administered dose is found in the stool. Studies in patients with hepatic dysfunction (compensated cirrhosis) indicate that there are minor, but clinically insignificant, alterations in ranitidine half-life, distribution, clearance, and bioavailability.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Excretion:</span></span> The principal route of excretion is the urine, with approximately 30% of the orally administered dose collected in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 hours. Renal clearance is about 410 mL/min, indicating active tubular excretion. The elimination half-life is 2.5 to 3 hours. Four patients with clinically significant renal function impairment (creatinine clearance 25 to 35 mL/min) administered 50 mg of ranitidine intravenously had an average plasma half-life of 4.8 hours, a ranitidine clearance of 29 mL/min, and a volume of distribution of 1.76L/Kg. In general, these parameters appear to be altered in proportion to creatinine clearance (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Geriatrics:</span></span> The plasma half-life is prolonged and total clearance is reduced in the elderly population due to a decrease in renal function. The elimination half-life is 3 to 4 hours. Peak levels average 526 ng/mL following a 150-mg twice-daily dose and occur in about 3 hours (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Impaired Renal Function).<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Pediatrics:</span></span> There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameter values for ranitidine in pediatric patients (from 1 month up to 16 years of age) and healthy adults when correction is made for body weight. The average bioavailability of ranitidine given orally to pediatric patients is 48%, which is comparable to the bioavailability of ranitidine in the adult population. All other pharmacokinetic parameters values (t1/2, Vd, and CL) are similar to those observed with intravenous ranitidine use in pediatric patients. Estimates of Cmax and Tmax are displayed in Table 1.</p><p> Plasma clearance measured in 2 neonatal patients (less than 1 month of age) was considerably lower (3 mL/min/Kg) than children or adults and is likely due to reduced renal function observed in this population (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Pediatric Use)</p><h2>Pharmacodynamics</h2><p class="First">Serum concentrations necessary to inhibit 50% of stimulated gastric acid secretion are estimated to be 36 to 94 ng/mL. Following a single oral dose of 150 mg, serum concentrations of ranitidine are in this range up to 12 hours. However, blood levels bear no consistent relationship to dose or degree of acid inhibition.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Antisecretory Activity: 1</span></span>. <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Effects on Acid secretion:</span></span> Ranitidine Tablets, USP inhibits both daytime and nocturnal basal gastric acid secretions as well as gastric acid secretion stimulated by food, betazole, and pentagastrin, as shown in Table 2.</p><p>It appears that basal-, nocturnal-, and betazole-stimulated secretions are most sensitive to inhibition by Ranitidine Tablets, USP responding almost completely to doses of 100 mg or less, while pentagastrin- and food-stimulated secretions are more difficult to suppress.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">2</span></span><span class="Bold">. <span class="Italics">Effects </span><span class="Italics">on Other Gastrointestinal Secretions:</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">    Pepsin:</span></span> Oral Ranitidine Tablets, USP does not affect pepsin secretion. Total pepsin output is reduced in proportion to the decrease in volume of gastric juice.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">    Intrinsic Factor:</span></span> Oral Ranitidine Tablets, USP has no significant effect on pentagastrin- stimulated intrinsic factor secretion.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">    Serum Gastrin:</span></span>  Ranitidine Tablets, USP has little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Other Pharmacologic Actions:</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">   Pediatrics:</span></span> Oral doses of 6 to 10 mg/kg/day in 2 or 3 divided doses maintain gastric pH&gt;4 throughout most of the dosing interval.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Trials:</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Active Duodenal Ulcer:</span></span> In a multicentre, double-blind, controlled, US study of endoscopically diagnosed duodenal ulcers, earlier healing was seen in the patients treated with Ranitidine Tablets, USP as shown in Table 3.</p><p><span class="Sup">*</span>All patients were permitted antacids as needed for relief of pain.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Sup">†</span>P&lt;</span>0.0001.</p><p>In these studies, patients treated with Ranitidine Tablets, USP reported a reduction in both daytime and nocturnal pain, and they also consumed less antacid than the placebo-treated patients.</p><p>       Foreign studies have shown that patients heal equally well with 150 mg twice daily and 300 mg at bedtime (85 % versus 84%, respectively) during a usual 4-week course of therapy. If patients require extended therapy of 8 weeks, the healing rate may be higher for 150 mg twice daily as compared to 300 mg at bedtime (92 % versus 87%, respectively).</p><p>       Studies have been limited to short-term treatment of acute duodenal ulcer. Patients whose ulcers healed during therapy had recurrences of ulcers at the usual rates.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">       Maintenance Therapy in Duodenal Ulcer:</span></span> Ranitidine has been found to be effective as maintenance therapy for patients following healing of acute duodenal ulcers. In 2 independent, double-blind, multicentre, controlled trials, the number of duodenal ulcers observed was significantly less in patients treated with Ranitidine Tablets, USP (150 mg at bedtime) than in patients treated with placebo over a 12-month period.</p><p>% = Life table estimate.</p><p><span class="Sup">*    </span>= <span class="Italics">P</span>&lt;0.05 (Ranitidine Tablets, USP versus comparator)</p><p>RAN = ranitidine (Ranitidine Tablets, USP)</p><p>PLC = placebo.</p><p>          As with other H<span class="Sub">2</span>-antagonists, the factors responsible for the significant reduction in the prevalence of duodenal ulcers include prevention of recurrence of ulcers, more rapid healing of ulcers that may occur during maintenance therapy, or both.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">         Gastric Ulcer:</span></span> In a multicentre, double-blind, controlled, US study of endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcers, earlier healing was seen in the patients treated with Ranitidine Tablets, USP as shown in Table 6.</p><p><span class="Sup">*</span>  All patients were permitted antacids as needed for relief of pain.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Sup">†</span>P</span> = 0.009.</p><p>           In this multicenter trial, significantly more patients treated with Ranitidine Tablets, USP became pain free during therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">         Maintenance of Healing of Gastric Ulcers:</span></span> In 2 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-month trails conducted in patients whose gastric ulcers had been previously healed, Ranitidine Tablets, USP 150 mg at bedtime was significantly more effective than placebo in maintaining healing of gastric ulcers.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">         Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions (such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome):</span></span> Ranitidine Tablets, USP  inhibits gastric acid secretion and reduces occurrence of diarrhea, anorexia, and pain in patients with pathological hypersecretion associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, and other pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g., postoperative, short-gut syndrome, idiopathic). Use of Ranitidine Tablets, USP was followed by healing of ulcers in 8 of 19 (42 %) patients who were intractable to previous therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">         Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)</span></span>: In 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week trails performed in the United States and Europe, Ranitidine Tablets, USP 150 mg twice daily was more effective than placebo for the relief of heartburn and other symptoms associated with GERD. Ranitidine treated patients consumed significantly less antacid than did placebo-treated patients.</p><p>          The US trial indicated that Ranitidine Tablets USP, 150 mg twice daily significantly reduced the frequency of heartburn attacks and severity of heartburn pain within 1 to 2 weeks after starting therapy. The improvement was maintained throughout the 6-week trial period. Moreover, patient response rates demonstrated that the effect on heartburn extends through both the day and night time periods.</p><p>          In 2 additional US multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-week trials, Ranitidine Tablets USP, 150 mg twice daily was shown to provide relief of heartburn pain within 24 hours of initiating therapy and a reduction in the frequency of severity of heartburn.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Erosive Esophagitis:</span></span> In 2 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trials performed in the United States, Ranitidine Tablets USP, 150 mg 4 times daily was significantly more effective than placebo in healing endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis and in relieving associated heartburn.

1. Short – term treatment of active duodenal ulcer. Most patients heal within 4 weeks. Studies available to date have not assessed the safety of ranitidine in uncomplicated duodenal ulcer for periods of more than 8 weeks.<br/>
2. Maintenance therapy for duodenal ulcer patients at reduced dosage after healing of acute ulcers. No placebo–controlled comparative studies have been carried out for periods of longer than 1 year.<br/>
3. The treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g., Zollinger–Ellision syndrome and systemic mastocytosis).<br/>
4. Short–term treatment of active, benign gastric ulcer. Most patients heal within 6 weeks and the usefulness of further treatment has not been demonstrated. Studies available to date have not assessed the safety of ranitidine in uncomplicated, benign gastric ulcer for periods of more than 6 weeks.<br/>
5. Maintenance therapy for gastric ulcer patients at reduced dosage after healing of acute ulcers. Placebo–controlled studies have been carried out for 1 year.<br/>
6. Treatment of GERD. Symptomatic relief commonly occurs within 24 hours after starting therapy with Ranitidine Tablets USP, 150 mg twice daily.<br/>
7. Treatment of endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis. Symptomatic relief of heartburn commonly occurs within 24 hours of therapy initiation with Ranitidine Tablets USP, 150 mg 4 times daily.<br/>
8. Maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis. Placebo–controlled trials have been carried out for 48 weeks.<br/>
Concomitant antacids should be given as needed for pain relief to patients with active duodenal ulcer; active, benign gastric ulcer; hypersecretory states; GERD; and erosive esophagitis.</p><p class="First">Ranitidine Tablets, USP is contraindicated for patients known to have hypersensitivity to the drug or any of the ingredients (see PRECAUTIONS).<br/>
<span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">General:</span><br/>
1. Symptomatic response to therapy with Ranitidine Tablets, USP does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.<br/>
2. Since Ranitidine Tablets, USP is excreted primarily by the kidney, dosage should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Caution should be observed in patients with hepatic dysfunction since Ranitidine Tablets, USP is metabolized in the liver.<br/>
3. Rare reports suggest that Ranitidine Tablets, USP may precipitate acute porphyric attacks in patients with acute porphyria. Ranitidine Tablets, USP should therefore be avoided in patients with a history of acute porphyria.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests:</span> False–positive tests for urine protein with MULTISTIX<span class="Sup">®</span> may occur during therapy with Ranitidine Tablets, USP and therefore testing with sulfosalicylic acid is recommended.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> Ranitidine has been reported to affect the bioavailability of other drugs through several different mechanisms such as competition for renal tubular secretion, alteration of gastric pH, and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Procainamide</span>:</span> Ranitidine, a substrate of the renal organic cation transport system, may affect the clearance of other drugs eliminated by this route. High doses of ranitidine (e.g., such as those used in the treatment of Zollinger–Ellison syndrome) have been shown to reduce the renal excretion of procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide resulting in increased plasma levels of these drugs. Although this interaction is unlikely to be clinically relevant at usual ranitidine doses, it may be prudent to monitor for procainamide toxicity when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Warfarin</span></span>: There have been reports of altered prothrombin time among patients on concomitant warfarin and ranitidine therapy. Due to the narrow therapeutic index, close monitoring of increased or decreased prothrombin time is recommended during concurrent treatment with ranitidine.<br/>
Ranitidine may alter the absorption of drugs in which gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability. This can result in either an increase in absorption (e.g., triazolam, midazolam, glipizide) or a decrease in absorption (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, delaviridine, gefitinib). Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Atazanavir</span></span>: Atazanavir absorption may be impaired based on known interactions with other agents that increase gastric pH. Use with caution. See atazanavir label for specific recommendations.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Delavirdine</span></span>: Delavirdine absorption may be impaired based on known interactions with other agents that increase gastric pH. Chronic use of H2–receptor antagonist with delavirdine is not recommended.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Gefitinib</span></span>: Gefitinib exposure was reduced by 44 % with the coadministration of ranitidine and sodium bicarbonate (dosed to maintain gastric pH above 5.0). Use with caution.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Glipizide</span></span>: In diabetic patients, glipizide exposure was increased by 34 % following a single 150-mg dose of oral ranitidine. Use appropriate clinical monitoring when initiating or discontinuing ranitidine.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Ketoconazole:</span></span> Oral ketoconazole exposure was reduced by up to 95 % when oral ranitidine was coadministered in a regimen to maintain a gastric pH of 6 or above. The degree of interaction with usual dose of ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) is unknown.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Midazolam:</span></span> Oral midazolam exposure in 5 healthy volunteers was increased by up to 65 % when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. However, in another interaction study in 8 volunteers receiving IV midazolam, a 300 mg oral dose of ranitidine increased midazolam exposure by about 9%. Monitor patients for excessive or prolonged sedation when ranitidine is coadministered with oral midazolam.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Triazolam:</span></span> Triazolam exposure in healthy volunteers was increased by approximately 30% when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. Monitor patients for excessive or prolonged sedation.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span>: There was no indication of tumorigenic or carcinogenic effects in life – span studies in mice and rats at dosages up to 2,000mg/kg/day.<br/>
Ranitidine was not mutagenic in standard bacterial tests (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) for mutagenicity at concentrations up to the maximum recommended for these assays.<br/>
In a dominant lethal assay, a single oral dose of 1,000 mg/kg to male rats was without effect on the outcome of 2 matings per week for the next 9 weeks.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects:</span></span> Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 160 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Ranitidine Tablets, USP. There are, however, no adequate and well–controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Ranitidine is secreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Ranitidine Tablets, USP is administered to a nursing mother.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> The safety and effectiveness of Ranitidine Tablets,  USP have been established in the age – group of 1 month to 16 years for the treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease and erosive esophagitis, and the maintenance of healed duodenal and gastric ulcer. Use of Ranitidine Tablets, USP in this age–group is supported by the adequate and well–controlled studies in adults, as well as additional pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients and an analysis of the published literature (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pediatrics and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Pediatric Use).<br/>
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions or the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis have not been established.<br/>
Safety and effectiveness in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pediatrics).<br/>
<span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> Of the total number of subjects enrolled in US and foreign controlled clinical trials of oral formulations of Ranitidine Tablets USP for which there were subgroup analyses, 4,197 were 65 and over, while 899 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.<br/>
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, caution should be exercised in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics: Geriatrics and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Impaired Renal Function).</p><p class="First">The following have been reported as events in clinical trials or in the routine management of patients treated with Ranitidine Tablets, USP. The relationship to therapy with Ranitidine Tablets, USP has been unclear in many cases. Headache, sometimes severe, seems to be related to administration of Ranitidine Tablets, USP.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Central Nervous system:</span> Rarely, malaise, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and vertigo. Rare cases of reversible mental confusion, agitation, depression, and hallucinations have been reported, predominantly in severely ill elderly patients. Rare cases of reversible blurred vision suggestive of a change in accommodation have been reported. Rare reports of reversible involuntary motor disturbances have been received.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Cardiovascular:</span> As with other H2-blockers, rare reports of arrhythmias such as tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular beats.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal:</span> Constipation, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal discomfort/pain and rare reports of pancreatitis.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Hepatic:</span>There have been occasional reports of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed hepatitis, with or without jaundice. In such circumstances, ranitidine should be immediately discontinued. These events are usually reversible, but in rare circumstances death has occurred. Rare cases of hepatic failure have also been reported. In normal volunteers, SGPT values were increased to at least twice the pretreatment levels in 6 of 12 subjects receiving 100 mg intravenously 4 times daily for 7 days, and in 4 of 24 subjects receiving 50 mg intravenously 4 times daily for 5 days.<br/>
Musculoskeletal: Rare reports of arthralgias and myalgias.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Hematologic:</span> Blood count changes (leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia) have occurred in a few patients. These were usually reverisible. Rare cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, sometimes with marrow hypoplasia, and aplastic anemia and exceedingly rare cases of acquired immune hemolytic anemia have been reported.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Endocrine:</span> Controlled studies in animals and man have shown no stimulation of any pituitary hormone by Ranitidine Tablets, USP and no antiandrogenic activity, and cimetidine–induced gynecomastia and impotence in hypersecretory patients have resolved when Ranitidine Tablets, USP has been substituted. However, occasional cases of impotence and loss of libido have been reported in male patients receiving Ranitidine Tablets, USP  but the incidence did not differ from that in the general population. Rare cases of breast symptoms and conditions, including galactorrhea and gynecomastia, have been reported in both males and females.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Integumentary:</span> Rash, including rare cases of erythema multiforme. Rare cases of alopecia and vasculitis.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Respiratory:</span> A large epidemiological study suggested an increased risk of developing pneumonia in current users of histamine–2–receptor antagonists (H2RAs) compared to patients who had stopped H2RA treatment, with an observed adjusted relative risk of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.07 – 2.48). However, a causal relationship between use of H2RAs and pneumonia has not been established.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Other:</span> Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., bronchospasm, fever, rash, eosinophilia), anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, acute interstitial nephritis, and small increase in serum creatinine.</p><p class="First">There has been limited experience with overdosage. Reported acute ingestions of up to 18 g orally have been associated with transient adverse effects similar to those encountered in normal clinical experience (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In addition, abnormalities of gait and hypotension have been reported.<br/>
When overdosage occurs, the usual measures to remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, clinical monitoring, and supportive therapy should be employed.<br/>
Studies in dogs receiving dosages of Ranitidine Tablets, USP in excess of 225 mg/kg/day have shown muscular tremors, vomiting, and rapid respiration. Single oral doses of 1,000 mg/kg in mice and rats were not lethal. Intravenous LD50 values in mice and rats were 77 and 83 mg/kg, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Active Duodenal Ulcer:</span> The current recommended adult oral dosage of Ranitidine Tablets, USP for duodenal ulcer is 150 mg twice daily. An alternative dosage of 300 mg once daily after the evening meal or at bedtime can be used for patients in whom dosing convenience is important. The advantages of one treatment regimen compared to the other in a particular patient population have yet to be demonstrated (see Clinical Trials: Active Duodenal Ulcer). Smaller doses have been shown to be equally effective in inhibiting gastric acid secretion in US studies, and several foreign trials have shown that 100 mg twice daily is as effective as the 150-mg dose.<br/>
Antacid should be given as needed for relief of pain (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics).<br/>
<span class="Bold">Maintenance of Healing of Duodenal Ulcers:</span> The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg at bedtime.<br/>
Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions (such as Zollinger – Ellison syndrome):<br/>
The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg twice daily. In some patients it may be necessary to administer Ranitidine Tablets USP, 150 mg doses more frequently. Dosages should be adjusted to individual patient needs, and should continue as long as clinically indicated. Dosages up to 6 g/day have been employed in patients with severe disease.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Benign Gastric Ulcer:</span> The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg twice daily<br/>
Maintenance of Healing of Gastric Ulcers: The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg at bedtime.<br/>
<span class="Bold">GERD:</span> The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg twice daily.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Erosive Esophagitis:</span> The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg 4 times daily.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis:</span> The current recommended adult oral dosage is 150 mg twice daily.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> The safety and effectiveness of Ranitidine Tablets, USP have been established in the age-group of 1 month to 16 years. There is insufficient information about the pharmacokinetics of Ranitidine Tablets, USP in neonatal patients (less than 1 month of age) to make dosing recommendations.<br/>
The following 3 subsections provide dosing information for each of the pediatric indications.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Treatment of Duodenal and Gastric Ulcers:</span></span> The recommended oral dose for the treatment of active duodenal and gastric ulcers is 2 to 4 mg/kg twice daily to a maximum of 300 mg/day. This recommendation is derived from adult clinical studies and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Maintenance of Healing of Duodenal and Gastric ulcers:</span></span> The recommended oral dose for the maintenance of healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers is 2 to 4 mg/kg once daily to a maximum of 150 mg/day. This recommendation is derived from adult clinical studies and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Treatment of GERD and Erosive Esophagitis:</span></span> Although limited data exist for these conditions in pediatric patients, published literature supports a dosage of 5 to 10 mg/kg/day, usually given as 2 divided doses.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Impaired Renal Function:</span> On the basis of experience with a group of subjects with severely impaired renal function treated with Ranitidine Tablets, USP  the recommended dosage in patients with a creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min is 150 mg every 24 hours. Should the patient’s condition require, the frequency of dosing may be increased to every 12 hours or even further with caution. Hemodialysis reduces the level of circulating ranitidine. Ideally, the dosing schedule should be adjusted so that the timing of a scheduled dose coincides with the end of hemodialysis.<br/>
Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be exercised in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics: Geriatrics and PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).</p><h2>How is Ranitidine Tablets Supplied</h2><p class="First">Ranitidine Tablets USP, 150 mg are Peach colored, five sided, biconvex, film coated tablets debossed with  on one side and  on the other side.
