in the ATRIGEL<span class="Sup">®</span> Delivery System<br/>
for controlled release in<br/>
subgingival application</p><h2>Atridox Description</h2><p class="First">The Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> product* is a subgingival controlled-release product composed of a two syringe mixing system. Syringe A contains 450 mg of the ATRIGEL<span class="Sup">®</span> Delivery System, which is a bioabsorbable, flowable polymeric formulation composed of 36.7% poly(DL-lactide) (PLA) dissolved in 63.3% <span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Syringe B contains 50 mg of doxycycline hyclate which is equivalent to 42.5 mg doxycycline. The constituted product is a pale yellow to yellow viscous liquid with a concentration of 10% of doxycycline hyclate. Upon contact with the crevicular fluid, the liquid product solidifies and then allows for controlled release of drug for a period of 7 days.</p><p>*Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> is a registered trademark of TOLMAR Inc.

Levels of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were also reduced after treatment with Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span>. The clinical significance of these findings, however, is not known. During these studies, no overgrowth of opportunistic organisms such as Gram-negative bacilli and yeast were observed. However, as with other antibiotic preparations, Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi. (See <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS</span>)</p><p><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, subjects were randomized to receive either Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> covered with Coe-Pak™ periodontal dressing (n=13), Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> covered with Octyldent™ periodontal adhesive (n=13), or oral doxycycline (n=5) (according to package dosing instructions). The doxycycline release characteristics in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva, and serum were evaluated.</p><p>Doxycycline levels in GCF peaked (~1,500 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL and ~2000 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL for Coe-Pak™ and Octyldent™ groups, respectively) 2 hours following treatment with Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span>. These levels remained above 1000 µg/mL through 18 hours, at which time the levels began to decline gradually. However, local levels of doxycycline remained well above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<span class="Sub">90</span>) for periodontal pathogens (≤ 6.0 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL)<span class="Sup">2</span> through Day 7. In contrast, subjects receiving oral doxycycline had peak GCF levels of ~2.5 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL at 12 hours following the initial oral dosing with levels declining to ~0.2 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL by Day 7. High variability was observed for doxycycline levels in GCF for both oral and Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> treatment groups.</p><p>The Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> doxycycline release profile in GCF is illustrated in the figure below.</p><p>The maximum concentration of doxycycline in saliva was achieved at 2 hours after both treatments with Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span>, with means of 4.05 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL and 8.78 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL and decreased to 0.36 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL and 0.23 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL at Day 7 for the Coe-Pak™ group and the Octyldent™ group, respectively.</p><p>The concentration of doxycycline in serum following treatment of Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> never exceeded 0.1 <span class="Italics">µ</span>g/mL.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In two well-controlled, multicenter, parallel-design, nine-month clinical trials, 831 patients (Study 1=411; Study 2=420) with chronic adult periodontitis characterized by a mean probing depth of 5.9 to 6.0 mm were enrolled. Subjects received one of four treatments: 1) Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span>, 2) Scaling and Root Planing, 3) Vehicle Control, or 4) Oral Hygiene. Treatment was administered to sites with probing depths 5 mm or greater that bled on probing. Subjects with detectable subgingival calculus on greater than 80% of all tooth surfaces were excluded from enrollment. All subjects received a second administration of the initially randomized treatment four months after their Baseline treatment. Changes in the efficacy parameters, attachment level, pocket depth, and bleeding on probing, between Baseline and Month 9 showed that: 1) Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> was superior to Vehicle Control and Oral Hygiene, and 2) Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> met the decision rule of being at least 75% as good as Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) (the standard of at least 75% as good as SRP is required for any product approved as a stand alone therapy for periodontitis). Clinicians should note that the studies were of nine months duration. Additional research would be necessary to establish long term comparability to SRP. The results of Studies #1 and 2 for efficacy parameters of attachment level gain and probing depth reduction are included in the following graphs.</p><p>A third clinical trial was conducted to determine whether the product can be left in the pocket to bioabsorb or be expelled naturally and  achieve comparable clinical results. In this study the product was retained with Octyldent™ dental adhesive rather than Coe-Pak™ periodontal dressing as in the previously mentioned studies. This was a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, parallel group, single blind trial that enrolled 605 subjects. The patient population studied and study design were comparable to that in Studies 1 and 2. Subjects received  one of three treatments: 1) Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> with Coe-Pak™ removed after  7 days as in the pivotal trials, 2) Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> retained with Octyldent™ and left to bioabsorb or be expelled naturally or 3) Vehicle Control with Octyldent™ left to bioabsorb or be expelled naturally. Changes in the efficacy parameters, attachment level, pocket depth and bleeding on probing were equivalent to those observed in Studies 1 and 2. The results of the third study support the use of Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> retained with Octyldent™ and left to bioabsorb or be expelled naturally.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for use in the treatment of chronic adult periodontitis for a gain in clinical attachment, reduction in probing depth, and reduction in bleeding on probing.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to doxycycline or any other drug in the tetracycline class.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF EIGHT YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH. This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, OR IN PREGNANT WOMEN, UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p><p>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has  been observed in some individuals taking doxycycline or other tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General </span></p><p>Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> has not been clinically tested in pregnant women.</p><p>Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> has not been clinically evaluated in patients with conditions involving extremely severe periodontal defects with very little remaining periodontium.</p><p>Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> has not been clinically tested for use in the regeneration of alveolar bone, either in preparation for or in conjunction with the placement of endosseous (dental) implants or in the treatment of failing implants.</p><p>Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> has not been clinically tested in immunocompromised patients (such as patients immunocompromised by diabetes, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or infection with HIV).</p><p>As with other antibiotic preparations, Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi.<span class="Sup">1</span> The effects of prolonged treatment, greater than six months, have not been studied.</p><p>Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> should be used with caution in patients with a history of or predisposition to oral candidiasis. The safety and effectiveness of Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> have not been established for the treatment of periodontitis in patients with coexistent oral candidiasis.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">Mechanical oral hygiene procedures (i.e., tooth brushing, flossing) should be avoided on any treated areas for 7 days.</p><p>Avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline.</p><p>Doxycycline may decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibiotics, oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors), and minocycline (thyroid tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline, oxytetracycline). Doxycycline administered orally at dosage levels as high as 250 mg/kg/day had no apparent effect on the fertility of female rats. Effect on male fertility has not been studied.<br/>

<span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category D.  See “WARNINGS” section</span></p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Tetracyclines appear in breast milk following oral administration. It is not known whether doxycycline is excreted in human milk following use of Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span>. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from doxycycline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. (See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>)</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> in pediatric patients have not been established. Oral doses of doxycycline in children up to 8 years of age have caused permanent discoloration of teeth.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">In clinical trials involving a total of 1436 patients, adverse experiences from all causalities were monitored across treatment groups.</p><p>In the Circulatory System category, 10 subjects (1.6%) in the Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> group were reported as having "unspecified essential hypertension." Only 1 subject (0.2%) in the Vehicle group, and none in the Scaling and Root Planing or Oral Hygiene groups were reported to have "unspecified essential hypertension." In all cases, the event occurred anywhere from 13 to 134 days post treatment. There is no known association of oral administration of doxycycline with essential hypertension.</p><p>Two patients in the polymer vehicle group and none in the Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> group (0.2% for both groups combined) reported adverse events consistent with a localized allergic response.</p><p>Sex, age, race and smoking status did not appear to be correlated with adverse events.</p><p>The following table lists the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events from all causalities, across all treatment groups, occurring in ≥1% of the entire study population.</p><h2>Atridox Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Atridox</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> <span class="Bold">is a variable dose product dependent on the size, shape, and number of pockets being treated.</span></p><h3>Preparation for Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">If immediate use is desired, skip to step 7.</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Continue with immediate use instructions.</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Product is now ready for application.</span></span></p><h3>Product Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Atridox</span><span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span> <span class="Bold">does not require local anesthesia for placement.</span> Bend the cannula to resemble a periodontal probe and explore the periodontal pocket in a manner similar to periodontal probing. Keeping the cannula tip near the base of the pocket, express the product into the pocket until the formulation reaches the top of the gingival margin. Withdraw the cannula tip from the pocket. In order to separate the tip from the formulation, turn the tip of the cannula towards the tooth, press the tip against the tooth surface, and pinch the string of formulation from the tip of the cannula. Variations on this technique may be needed to achieve separation between Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> and cannula.</p><p>If desired, using an appropriate dental instrument, Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> may be packed into the pocket. Dipping the edge of the instrument in water before packing will help keep Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> from sticking to the instrument, and will help speed coagulation of Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span>. A few drops of water dripped onto the surface of Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> once in the pocket will also aid in coagulation. If necessary, add more Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> as described above and pack it into the pocket until the pocket is full.</p><p>Cover the pockets containing Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> with either Coe-Pak™ periodontal dressing or a cyanoacrylate dental adhesive.</p><p>Application of Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> may be repeated four months after initial treatment.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">The final blended product is 500 mg of formulation containing 50 mg of doxycycline hyclate (doxycycline hyclate, 10%).</p><p>Atridox® is available in a tray containing a doxycycline hyclate syringe (50 mg), an ATRIGEL® Delivery System syringe (450 mg), and a blunt cannula. The trayed product is available in a professional sample box of two (NDC 59883-100-02) or a box of six (NDC 59883-100-06).</p><p>Each Atridox<span class="Sup">®</span> syringe system is intended for use in only one patient. Do not use if packaging has been previously opened or damaged.</p><h3>Storage and Handling</h3><p class="First">Store at 2° - 30°C (36° - 86°F).<br/>
