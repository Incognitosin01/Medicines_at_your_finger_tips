</ul><h2>Escavite D - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Escavite® D Multi-vitamin with Iron and Fluoride Chewable Tablets provide sodium fluoride, magnesium, zinc, copper, twelve essential vitamins, and iron in a chewable tablet. Because tablets are chewable, they provide a topical as well as systemic source of fluoride.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal fluorapatite. The reaction may be expressed by the equation:</p><p>Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:</p><p>1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed.</p><p>2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted.</p><p>3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from water, food supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Escavite D</h2><p class="First">Escavite® D Multi-vitamin with Iron and Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription drug product for the dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis, and provides supplementation of the diet with twelve essential vitamins, magnesium, zinc, copper and iron.</p><p>Escavite® D Multi-vitamin with Iron and Fluoride Chewable Tablets provide 0.25 mg of fluoride in a chewable tablet form for children 4-6 years of age where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Escavite® D Multi-vitamin with Iron and Fluoride Chewable Tablets supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, Vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain twelve essential vitamins and the important minerals, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron and fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to the age of 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation. Children using Escavite® D Multi-vitamin with Iron and Fluoride Chewable Tablets regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.</p><p class="First">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. KEEP THIS PRODUCT OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. In case of accidental overdosage, call a doctor or a poison control center immediately.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose of Escavite® D Multi-vitamin with Iron and Fluoride Chewable Tablets should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride.</p><p>Before prescribing Escavite® D Multi-vitamin with Iron and Fluoride Chewable Tablets:</p><p>1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources.</p><p>2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste.</p><p>3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis.</p><p>Your doctor or dentist is the best source of counsel and guidance in your child's fluoride supplementation.</p><p>Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations progress.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Incompatibility of fluoride with dairy foods has been reported due to formation of calcium fluoride which is poorly absorbed.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported. To report adverse side effects or to obtain product information, contact GM Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-535-0305.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">Prolonged daily ingestion of excessive fluoride will result in varying degrees of Fluorosis.</p><h2>Escavite D Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Chew one tablet daily or as prescribed by doctor, or dentist. Tablets should be chewed or crushed before they are swallowed. This product is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking.</p><h2>How is Escavite D Supplied</h2><p class="First">They are available in bottles of 60 chewable tablets (NDC 58809-829-60) and 1 count physician samples (NDC 58809-829-02).</p><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F). See USP Controlled Room Temperature. Protect from light and moisture. Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container with a child-resistant closure as defined in the USP/NF.</p><h2>KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN</h2><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
