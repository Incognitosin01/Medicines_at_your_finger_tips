Ask your pharmacist which type of needles are best to use with your pen.</p><p>Your care provider will show you the best places on your body to inject Saxenda. Use a different place each time you give an injection. Do not inject into the same place two times in a row.</p><p>Do not use Saxenda if it has changed colors or if it has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination, blurred vision, headache, and tiredness.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>Use a disposable needle only once. Follow any state or local laws about throwing away used needles and syringes. Use a puncture-proof "sharps" disposal container (ask your pharmacist where to get one and how to throw it away). Keep this container out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Saxenda is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care.

Protect the pens from moisture, heat, and sunlight. Use within 30 days. Remove the needle before storing an injection pen, and keep the cap on the pen when not in use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing information</h2><p><b>Usual Adult Dose of Saxenda for Weight Loss:</b></p><p>Dose escalation should be followed to reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal symptoms; dose escalation may be delayed by 1 additional week if necessary:<br/>
Week 1: Inject 0.6 mg subcutaneously once a day<br/>
Week 2: Inject 1.2 mg subcutaneously once a day<br/>
Week 3: Inject 1.8 mg subcutaneously once a day<br/>
Week 4: Inject 2.4 mg subcutaneously once a day<br/>
Week 5: Inject 3 mg subcutaneously once a day<br/>
Maintenance dose: 3 mg subcutaneously once a day<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
-Consider dose reduction of the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia; conversely when discontinuing use in a patient with type 2 diabetes, monitor for an increase in blood glucose.<br/>
-If a dose of 3 mg once daily is not tolerated, discontinuation is recommended; efficacy for chronic weight management has not been established at lower doses.<br/>
-Evaluate weight loss at 16 weeks; if at least 4% of body weight has not been lost, it is unlikely the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Use: In adult patients with an initial BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese) or an initial BMI of 27 kg/m2 (overweight) or greater in the presence of at least 1 weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia), this drug is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management.<br/>
<br/>
BMI=Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Charts are available for determining BMI based on height and weight, including a chart in Saxenda product labeling.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>If you miss your daily dose of Saxenda, use the dose as soon as you remember.
