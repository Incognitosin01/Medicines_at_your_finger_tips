</ul><h2>PHARMACIST:</h2><p class="First">Tear off “Instructions for Use” and dispense with container in carton.</p><h2>Medihaler Ergotamine Description</h2><p class="First">Medihaler Ergotamine (ergotamine tartrate) is an oral aerosol device which contains a fine particle suspension of 9.0 mg ergotamine tartrate per ml in an insert, nontoxic aerosol vehicle. The inert ingredients are dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, sorbitan trioleate and trichloromonofluoromethane. Each depression of the valve delivers a measured dose of 0.36 mg to the patient.</p><h2>ACTION</h2><p class="First">Ergotamine exerts a constrictor action upon cranial vessels.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">As therapy to abort vascular headache, e.g., migraine, migraine variants, or so-called “histaminic cephalalgia.”</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Ergotamine tartrate should not be used in the presence of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, impaired renal or hepatic function, infectious states or malnutrition.</p><p>Ergotamine tartrate is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy:</span> Ergotamine tartrate is contraindicated in pregnancy.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Patients who are being treated with Medihaler Ergotamine should be informed adequately of the symptoms of ergotism. Close medical supervision by the physician is recommended so that he may react appropriately should signs of ergotism develop. Six inhalations per day, if continued daily, entail the risk of vasospastic complications. Avoid prolonged administration or in excess of the recommended dosage because of the danger of ergotism and gangrene.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients</span>: Since there is no experience in children who have received this drug, safety and efficacy in children have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> Whether ergotamine tartrate is excreted in mothers' milk is not known. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug (since many drugs are excreted in human milk).</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Ergotamine tartrate may cause nausea and vomiting. Patients with headaches may become nauseated and drug induced distress may be difficult to evaluate.</p><p>Ergotamine in large doses raises arterial pressure, produces coronary vasoconstriction and slows the heart both by direct action and its effect on the vagus. Under this condition, ergotamine also has oxytocic and spasmolytic properties. The above conditions are seen as a consequence of overdosage and may be manifested at the dosage recommended for control of headaches.</p><p>Vasoconstrictive complications, at times of a serious nature, may occur. These include pulselessness, weakness, muscle pains and paresthesias of the extremities and precordial distress and pain. Although these effects occur most commonly with long term therapy at relatively high doses, they have also been reported with short term or normal doses. Other adverse effects include transient tachycardia or bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, localized edema and itching.</p><h2>Medihaler Ergotamine Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults:</span> A single oral inhalation at the first sign of a headache or prodrome. Repeat this procedure in 5 minutes if relief is not obtained. Space and additional inhalations at no less than 5-minute intervals. No more than 6 inhalations should be administered in any 24-hour period, and no more than 15 in a one week period.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Children:</span> A recommended dose for children has not been determined.</p><h2>DIRECTIONS FOR USE:</h2><p class="First">Before each use, remove dust cap and shake MEDIHALER ERGOTAMINE.</p><h2>How is Medihaler Ergotamine Supplied</h2><p class="First">Metal vial (2.5 ml) and adapter. Each depression of the valve delivers 0.36 mg ergotamine tartrate.</p><p>(NDC <span class="Bold">0089-0762-21</span>)</p><h2>CAUTION</h2><p class="First">Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.</p><h2>CONTENTS UNDER PRESSURE</h2><p class="First">Do not puncture or incinerate container.
