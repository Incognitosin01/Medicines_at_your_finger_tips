Metformin and repaglinide are both oral diabetes medicines that help control blood sugar levels. Repaglinide works by causing the pancreas to produce insulin. Metformin works by decreasing glucose (sugar) production in the liver and decreasing absorption of glucose by the intestines.</p><p>PrandiMet is used together with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>PrandiMet is not for treating type 1 diabetes.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use PrandiMet if you have severe kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, or diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p>You should not use PrandiMet together with gemfibrozil or NPH insulin (such as isophane insulin).</p><p>If you need to have any type of x-ray or CT scan using a dye that is injected into your veins, you may need to temporarily stop taking PrandiMet.</p><p>You may develop <b>lactic acidosis,</b> a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in your blood. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if you have unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, stomach pain, dizziness, feeling cold, or feeling very weak or tired.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine/h2&gt;</h2><p>You should not use PrandiMet if you are allergic to metformin or repaglinide, or if you have:</p><ul>

To quickly treat hypoglycemia, eat or drink a fast-acting source of sugar (fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda).</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe a glucagon injection kit in case you have severe hypoglycemia. Be sure your family or close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>PrandiMet is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, blood sugar testing, and special medical care.
