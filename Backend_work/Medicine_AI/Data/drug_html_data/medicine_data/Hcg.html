HCG is also used in young boys when their testicles have not dropped down into the scrotum normally. This can be caused by a pituitary gland disorder.</p><p>HCG may also be used for other purposes not listed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>HCG is given as an injection under the skin or into a muscle. If you use HCG at home, your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will give you specific instructions on how and where to inject this medicine. Do not self-inject HCG if you do not fully understand how to give the injection and properly dispose of used needles and syringes.</p><p><b>HCG can place you at higher risk for a blood clot.</b> Call your doctor at once if you have any of these signs of a blood clot: pain, warmth, redness, numbness, or tingling in your arm or leg; confusion, extreme dizziness, or severe headache.</p><p><b>Some women using this medicine have developed a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS),</b> especially after the first treatment cycle. OHSS can be a life-threatening condition. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of OHSS: severe pelvic pain, swelling of the hands or legs, stomach pain and swelling, shortness of breath, weight gain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or if you are urinating less than normal.</p><p><b>HCG can cause early puberty in young boys.</b> Call your doctor if a boy using this medicine shows early signs of puberty, such as a deepened voice, pubic hair growth, and increased acne or sweating.</p><p><b>Using HCG can increase your chances of having a multiple pregnancy</b> (twins, triplets, quadruplets, etc). A multiple pregnancy is a high-risk pregnancy for the mother and for the babies. Follow your doctor's instructions about any special care you may need during your pregnancy.</p><p>Although HCG can help you become pregnant, it should not be used during pregnancy. Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant during treatment.</p><p>HCG has no known effect on appetite, hunger, fat loss, or fat distribution.
