When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should only be considered for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and non-estrogen medications should be carefully considered.</p><p>Limitation of Use</p><p>When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, therapy should only be considered for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and non-estrogen medications should be carefully considered.</p><h2>Minivelle Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( <span class="Bold">5.2, 5.14</span>)].</span></p><p>Use of estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.</p><h3>Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms</h3><p class="First">Start therapy with Minivelle 0.0375 mg per day applied to the skin twice weekly. Dosage adjustment should be guided by the clinical response.</p><p>Therapy should be started at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with the treatment goals. Attempts to taper or discontinue the medication should be made at 3 to 6 month intervals.</p><h3>Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis</h3><p class="First">Start therapy with Minivelle 0.025 mg per day applied to the skin twice weekly. The dose may be adjusted as necessary.</p><h3>Patch Application Instructions</h3><p class="First">The adhesive side of Minivelle should be placed on a clean, dry area on the lower abdomen (below the umbilicus) or buttocks. Minivelle should not be applied to the breasts.</p><p>Minivelle should be replaced twice weekly (every 3-4 days).</p><p>The sites of application must be rotated, with an interval of at least 1 week allowed between applications to a particular site.</p><p>The area selected should not be oily, damaged, or irritated. The waistline should be avoided, since tight clothing may rub the system off. The system should be applied immediately after opening the pouch and removing the protective liner. The system should be pressed firmly in place with the palm of the hand for about 10 seconds, making sure there is good contact with the skin, especially around the edges. In the event that a system should fall off, the same system may be reapplied. If the same system cannot be reapplied, a new system should be applied to another location. If a woman has forgotten to apply a patch, she should apply a new patch as soon as possible. In either case, the original treatment schedule should be continued. The interruption of treatment in women taking Minivelle might increase the likelihood of breakthrough bleeding, spotting and recurrence of symptoms.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Transdermal system: 0.025 mg/day, 0.0375 mg/day, 0.05 mg/day, 0.075 mg/day, and 0.1 mg/day.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Minivelle is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions:</p><ul>
<li>Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding</li>
<li>Known, suspected or history of breast cancer</li>
<li>Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia</li>

During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open-label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in the HERS, HERS II, and overall.</p><p><span class="Italics">Venous Thromboembolism</span></p><p>In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE), was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years ³ <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies ( <span class="Bold">14.3</span>)]</span> .

If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.</p><h3>Visual Abnormalities</h3><p class="First">Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.</p><h3>Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy</h3><p class="First">Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.</p><p>There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.</p><h3>Elevated Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.</p><h3>Hypertriglyceridemia</h3><p class="First">In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice</h3><p class="First">Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.</p><h3>Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First">Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T <span class="Sub">4</span> and T <span class="Sub">3</span> serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.</p><h3>Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogen is prescribed.</p><h3>Hypocalcemia</h3><p class="First">Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Endometriosis</h3><p class="First">A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.</p><h3>Severe Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions and Angioedema</h3><p class="First">Cases of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, which developed anytime during the course of Minivelle treatment and required emergency medical management, have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Involvement of skin (hives, pruritus, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) has been noted.</p><p>Angioedema involving eye/eyelid, face, larynx, pharynx, tongue and extremity (hands, legs, ankles, and fingers) with or without urticaria requiring medical intervention has occurred in the postmarketing experience of using Minivelle. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur. Patients who develop angioedema anytime during the course of treatment with Minivelle should not receive it again.</p><p>Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Other Conditions</h3><p class="First">Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraines, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.</p><h3>Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex; and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti factor Xa and antithrombin III; decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.</p><p>Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T <span class="Sub">4</span> levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay) or T <span class="Sub">3</span> levels by radioimmunoassay. T <span class="Sub">3</span> resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T <span class="Sub">4</span> and free T <span class="Sub">3</span> concentrations are unaltered.

Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of Minivelle therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care.</p><h2>Minivelle Description</h2><p class="First">Minivelle (estradiol transdermal system) contains estradiol in a multipolymeric adhesive. The system is designed to release estradiol continuously upon application to intact skin.</p><p>Five dosage strengths of Minivelle are available to provide nominal <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> delivery rates of 0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, 0.075, or 0.1 mg of estradiol per day via the skin. Each corresponding system has an active surface area of 1.65, 2.48, 3.30, 4.95, or 6.6 cm <span class="Sup">2</span> and contains 0.41, 0.62, 0.83, 1.24, or 1.65 mg of estradiol USP, respectively. The composition of the systems per unit area is identical.</p><p>Estradiol USP is a white, crystalline powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5 (10)-triene-3,17β-diol.</p><p>The structural formula is</p><p></p><p>The molecular formula of estradiol is C <span class="Sub">18</span>H <span class="Sub">24</span>0 <span class="Sub">2</span>. The molecular weight is 272.39</p><p>Minivelle is comprised of three layers. Proceeding from the visible surface toward the surface attached to the skin, these layers are (1) a polyolefin laminate backing (2) an adhesive formulation containing estradiol, acrylic adhesive, silicone adhesive, oleyl alcohol, NF, povidone, USP and dipropylene glycol, and (3) a polyester release liner which is attached to the adhesive surface and must be removed before the system can be used.</p><p></p><p>The active component of the system is estradiol. The remaining components of the system are pharmacologically inactive.</p><h2>Minivelle - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.</p><p>The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.</p><p>Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated concentrations of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">There are no pharmacodynamic data for Minivelle.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Systemic estrogen exposures across different estrogen products should not be compared. These comparisons can be unreliable and misleading when there are differences in route of administration, estrogen components, dosing, or analytical methods that were used across the studies.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>In a single-dose, two way-crossover clinical study conducted in 96 healthy, non-smoking postmenopausal women under fed condition, Minivelle (0.1 mg per day) was bioequivalent to Vivelle (0.1 mg per day) based on estradiol exposure (AUC <span class="Sub">0-84</span>) and estradiol peak concentration (C <span class="Sub">max</span>) following a single-dose on the lower abdomen for 84 hours.</p><p>Estradiol pharmacokinetics were characterized in a separate open-label, single-center, randomized, single-dose, three-way crossover study conducted in 36 healthy, non-smoking postmenopausal women (aged 40 to 65 years). Minivelle transdermal systems delivering nominal estradiol of approximately 0.025 mg, 0.05 mg, and 0.1 mg per day were applied to the lower abdomen under fed state in a crossover fashion for 84 hours. The mean estradiol pharmacokinetics parameters are summarized in Table 2. AUC and C <span class="Sub">max</span> are dose proportional from 0.025 mg to 0.1 mg per day.</p><p>Figure 1 illustrates the mean baseline-uncorrected estradiol serum concentrations of Minivelle at three different strengths.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1: Mean Baseline-Uncorrected Estradiol Serum Concentration-Time Profiles Following a Single Dose of Minivelle 0.1 mg per day (Treatment A), 0.05 mg per day (Treatment B), and 0.025 mg per day (Treatment C) (N=36)</span></p><p></p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>No specific investigation of the tissue distribution of estradiol absorbed from Minivelle in humans has been conducted. The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The mean half-life values of estradiol calculated from treatment groups in the bioequivalence study and dose-proportionality study after dosing with the Minivelle ranged from 6.2 to 7.9 hours. After removal of the transdermal systems, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned to baseline concentrations within 24 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Adhesion and Adhesive Residue</span></p><p>Based on combined data from bioequivalence and dose proportionality studies consisting of 208 Minivelle observations, approximately 98 percent of the observations had an adhesion score of 0 (i.e., the skin adhesion rate was greater than or equal to 90 percent) over the 84-hour wear period. One subject had a complete detachment during the wear period. Approximately 65 percent of the transdermal systems evaluated in these studies were with Minivelle 0.1 mg per day (6.6 cm <span class="Sup">2</span> active surface area).</p><p>After removal of Minivelle, subjects had either no adhesive residue (score of 0) or light adhesive residue (score of 1). There were no subjects who had medium adhesive residue. Of the 208 Minivelle observations, 54 percent had light adhesive residue and 46 percent had no adhesive residue.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term, continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms</h3><p class="First">There have been no efficacy and safety trials conducted with Minivelle.

Two hundred thirty-two (89 percent) randomized subjects (173 on active drug, 59 on placebo) contributed data to the analysis of percent change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) of the AP lumbar spine, the primary efficacy variable. Patients were given supplemental dietary calcium (100 mg elemental calcium/day) but no supplemental vitamin D. There was an increase in BMD of the AP lumbar spine in all Vivelle dose groups; in contrast to this, a decrease in AP lumbar spine BMD was observed in placebo patients.

<li>Using estrogen-alone may increase your chance of getting cancer of the uterus (womb). Report any unusual vaginal bleeding right away while you are using Minivelle.

</ul><p class="Bold">What is Minivelle?</p><p>Minivelle is a prescription medicine patch (Transdermal System) that contains estradiol (an estrogen hormone). When applied to the skin as directed below, Minivelle releases estrogen through the skin into the bloodstream.</p><p class="Bold">What is Minivelle <span class="Sup">®</span> used for?</p><p>THE Minivelle patch is used after menopause to:</p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">Reduce moderate to severe hot flashes</span><br/>
Estrogens are hormones made by a woman’s ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the “change of life” or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes “surgical menopause.”<br/>
When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating (“hot flashes” or “hot flushes”). In some women, the symptoms are mild and they will not need treatment with estrogen therapy. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether or not you still need treatment with Minivelle.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis (thin weak bones)</span><br/>
Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use Minivelle only to prevent osteoporosis from menopause, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you.<br/>
You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you should continue treatment with Minivelle.</li>
</ul><p class="Bold">Who should not use Minivelle?</p><p>Do not start using Minivelle if you:</p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">have unusual vaginal bleeding</span><br/>
Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">currently have or have had certain cancers</span><br/>
Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus. If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use Minivelle.</li>
<li class="Bold">had a stroke or heart attack</li>
<li class="Bold">currently have or have had blood clots</li>
<li class="Bold">currently have or have had liver problems</li>
<li class="Bold">have been diagnosed with a bleeding disorder</li>
<li><span class="Bold">are allergic to Minivelle or any of its ingredients</span><br/>
See the list of ingredients in Minivelle at the end of this leaflet.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">think you may be pregnant</span><br/>
Minivelle is not for pregnant women. If you think you may be pregnant, you should have a pregnancy test and know the results. Do not take Minivelle if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider.</li>
</ul><p class="Bold">What should I tell my healthcare provider before I use Minivelle?</p><p class="Bold">Before you use Minivelle, tell your healthcare provider if you:</p><ul>
