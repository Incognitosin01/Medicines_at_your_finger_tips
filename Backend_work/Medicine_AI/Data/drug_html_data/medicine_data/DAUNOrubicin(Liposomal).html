Once in tissues, daunorubicin is released (over time). Daunorubicin inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis by intercalation between DNA base pairs and by steric obstruction; and intercalates at points of local uncoiling of the double helix. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it appears that direct binding to DNA (intercalation) and inhibition of DNA repair (topoisomerase II inhibition) result in blockade of DNA and RNA synthesis and fragmentation of DNA.</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>d</sub>: ~5 to 8 L</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Daunorubicinol (major active metabolite) is detected at low levels in plasma</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Primarily feces; some urine </p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Distribution: 4.4 hours</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Kaposi sarcoma:</b> First-line treatment of advanced HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma</p><p>Limitation of use: Daunorubicin (liposomal) is not recommended in HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma which is less than advanced.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to daunorubicin (liposomal) or any component of the formulation</p><p>Documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for drugs in this class is limited. However, because of similarities in chemical structure and/or pharmacologic actions, the possibility of cross-sensitivity cannot be ruled out with certainty.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note: </b>DaunoXome has been discontinued in the US for more than 1 year.</p><p><b>Note: </b>DAUNOrubicin (liposomal) is different from the conventional DAUNOrubicin formulation; do <b>NOT</b> substitute (indications and doses are different).</p><p><b>Kaposi sarcoma:</b> IV: 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once every 2 weeks; continue until disease progression.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: </b>Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Although the risk increases with cumulative dose, irreversible cardiotoxicity may occur with anthracycline treatment at any dose level. Patients who have received prior anthracycline therapy (DOXOrubicin &gt;300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or equivalent), with preexisting heart disease, hypertension, concurrent administration of other antineoplastic agents, prior or concurrent chest irradiation, and advanced age are at increased risk. Evaluate LVEF prior to treatment and periodically during treatment (at cumulative doses of daunorubicin liposomal 320 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and every 160 mg/m<sup>2</sup> thereafter or every 160 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in patients at higher risk).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Reduce dosage in patients with hepatic impairment.</b></p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; may require dosage reduction.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Experienced physician: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Should be administered under the supervision of an experienced cancer chemotherapy physician. </b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential and platelets (prior to each dose), liver function tests, renal function tests; evaluate cardiac function (baseline left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] prior to treatment initiation; repeat LVEF at total cumulative doses of 320 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and every 160 mg/m<sup>2</sup> thereafter; patients with preexisting cardiac disease, history of prior chest irradiation, or history of prior anthracycline treatment should have baseline LVEF and every 160 mg/m<sup>2</sup> thereafter); signs and symptoms of infection or disease progression; monitor closely for infusion reactions</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
