<html><head></head><body><h1>Vantrela ER (Oral)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> hydrocodone (hye-droe-KOE-done bye-TAR-trate) (Oral route)</p><p>Prior to prescribing hydrocodone, assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, and regularly monitor all patients for opioid addiction behaviors or conditions. To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Monitor for respiratory depression, which can be serious, life-threatening, or fatal, especially during initiation or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow extended release forms whole to avoid potentially fatal overdose. Accidental ingestion of hydrocodone can result in a fatal overdose, especially in children. If prolonged opioid use is necessary during pregnancy, advise patient of potential risk of life-threatening neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure appropriate treatment will be available. Use with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may change hydrocodone plasma levels resulting in prolonged adverse effects or potentially fatal respiratory depression; monitoring is recommended. Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for patients with inadequate alternative treatment options, limit dosage and duration to the minimum required, and monitor for respiratory depression and sedation. Alcoholic beverages or medications containing alcohol should be avoided due to the potential for increased hydrocodone plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose .</p><p>Addiction, Abuse, and MisuseHydrocodone extended-release (ER) exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing Hydrocodone ER, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions.Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a REMS for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to: complete a REMS-compliant education program, counsel patients and/or their caregivers, with every prescription, on safe use, serious risks, storage, and disposal of these products, emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide every time it is provided by their pharmacists, and consider other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety.Life-Threatening Respiratory DepressionSerious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Hydrocodone ER. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Hydrocodone ER or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow hydrocodone bitartrate ER tablets whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving hydrocodone bitartrate tablets can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of hydrocodone bitartrate.Accidental IngestionAccidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydrocodone ER, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of Hydrocodone ER.Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal SyndromeProlonged use of Hydrocodone ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.Cytochrome P450 3A4 InteractionThe concomitant use of Hydrocodone ER with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in Hydrocodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in Hydrocodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving Hydrocodone ER and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer.Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS DepressantsReserve concomitant prescribing of Hydrocodone ER and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed". Hydrocodone belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines) that act on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.</p><p>When hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. <i>Hysinglaâ„¢</i> is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Vantrela ER</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of hydrocodone in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hydrocodone in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have confusion and severe drowsiness and age-related liver, kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving hydrocodone.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
