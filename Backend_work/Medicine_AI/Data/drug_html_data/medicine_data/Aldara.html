Aldara is used to treat actinic keratosis (a condition caused by too much sun exposure) on the face and scalp.</p><p>Aldara (for the skin) is also used to treat a minor form of skin cancer called superficial basal cell carcinoma, when surgery would not be an appropriate treatment.</p><p>Aldara also treats genital warts that appear on the outside of the body, but this medicine is not a cure for genital warts. Imiquimod may be used in adults and children who are at least 12 years.</p><p>Aldara may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Using too much Aldara, or using it for too long can increase your risk of severe skin reactions. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Do not use Aldara on areas of broken, wounded, or burned skin (including sunburn).</p><p>Before using Aldara, tell your doctor if you have a weak immune system, an autoimmune disorder, graft-versus-host disease, or if you have recently received a bone marrow transplant or cord blood transplant.</p><p>When treating genital warts around the vagina, avoid getting the cream on the more sensitive inner layers of vaginal tissue. This could result in vaginal swelling or irritation and painful urination. Avoid exposure to sunlight or tanning beds. Aldara can make you sunburn more easily. Wear protective clothing and use sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) when you are outdoors.</p><p>Aldara is not a cure for genital warts and it may not keep you from spreading this condition to others through vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
