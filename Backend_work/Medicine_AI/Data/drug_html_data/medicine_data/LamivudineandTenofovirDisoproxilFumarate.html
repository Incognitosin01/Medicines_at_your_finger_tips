Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Decreased bone mineral density: In clinical trials, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with decreases in bone mineral density in HIV-1 infected adults and increases in bone metabolism markers. Serum parathyroid hormone and 1,25 vitamin D levels were also higher. Effects on long-term bone health and future fracture risk, including long-term effects on skeletal growth in pediatric patients and effects of extended duration in younger children, are unknown. In all pediatric clinical trials, skeletal growth (height) was not affected. Consider monitoring of bone density in adults and pediatric patients with a history of pathologic fractures or with other risk factors for bone loss or osteoporosis. Consider calcium and vitamin D supplementation for all patients; effect of supplementation has not been studied, but may be beneficial. If abnormalities are suspected, expert assessment is recommended.</p><p>• Immune reconstitution syndrome: Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome resulting in the occurrence of an inflammatory response to an indolent or residual opportunistic infection during initial HIV treatment or activation of autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome) later in therapy; further evaluation and treatment may be required.</p><p>• Lactic acidosis/hepatomegaly: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported with use of nucleoside analogues, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Suspend treatment in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (marked transaminase elevation may/may not accompany hepatomegaly and steatosis).</p><p>• Osteomalacia and renal dysfunction: May cause osteomalacia with proximal renal tubulopathy. Bone pain, extremity pain, fractures, arthralgias, weakness, and muscle pain have been reported. In patients at risk for renal dysfunction, persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms should be evaluated for hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia.</p><p>• Renal toxicity: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may cause renal toxicity (acute renal failure and/or Fanconi syndrome); avoid use with concurrent or recent nephrotoxic therapy (including high dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] use). Acute renal failure has occurred in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal impairment who were on a stable tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimen to which a high dose or multiple NSAID therapy was added. Consider alternatives to NSAIDS in patients taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and at risk for renal impairment. Calculate estimated CrCl and assess serum creatinine, urine glucose, and urine protein prior to treatment initiation and during therapy in all patients. Assess serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease. IDSA guidelines recommend discontinuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (and substituting with alternative antiretroviral therapy) in HIV-infected patients who develop a decline in GFR (a &gt;25% decrease in GFR from baseline and to a level of &lt;60 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) during use, particularly in presence of proximal tubular dysfunction (eg, euglycemic glycosuria, increased urinary phosphorus excretion and hypophosphatemia, proteinuria [new onset or worsening]) (IDSA [Lucas 2014]).</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Chronic hepatitis B: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1, following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy.</b> <b>Closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV; if appropriate, anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis.</b> All patients with HIV should be tested for HBV prior to initiation of treatment.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Do not use in patients with CrCl &lt;50 mL/minute or requiring hemodialysis.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Pediatric: Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure or pancreatitis, or other significant risk factors for development of pancreatitis.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CD4 count, HIV RNA plasma levels; serum creatinine, serum phosphorous (in patients with chronic kidney disease), urine glucose, urine protein, and estimated creatinine clearance (prior to initiation and as clinically indicated during therapy); hepatic function tests, bone density (patients with a history of bone fracture or have risk factors for bone loss); testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is recommended prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Patients with HIV and HBV coinfection should be monitored for several months following therapy discontinuation.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) Perinatal HIV Guidelines consider lamivudine in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate a preferred combination for females living with HIV who are not yet pregnant but are trying to conceive (HHS [perinatal] 2019).</p><p>Refer to individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>The Health and Human Services (HHS) Perinatal HIV Guidelines consider lamivudine in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to be one of the preferred NRTI backbone for initial therapy in antiretroviral-naive pregnant females. This combination is also preferred for pregnant females who have had antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the past but are restarting, or who require a new ART regimen (due to poor tolerance or poor virologic response of current regimen). Females who become pregnant while taking this combination may continue if viral suppression is effective and the regimen is well tolerated. The guidelines also consider lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to be a recommended dual NRTI backbone in regimens for HIV/HBV-coinfected pregnant females (HHS [perinatal] 2019).</p><p>Refer to individual monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat HIV infection.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
