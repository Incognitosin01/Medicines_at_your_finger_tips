It reduces parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and improves calcium and phosphate homeostasis by stimulating bone resorption of calcium and increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Decreased renal conversion of vitamin D to its primary active metabolite (1,25 hydroxyvitamin D) in chronic renal failure leads to reduced activation of vitamin D receptor, which subsequently removes inhibitory suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) release; increased serum PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism) reduces calcium excretion and enhances bone resorption.</p><h3>Absorption</h3><p>Oral: Rapid</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Primarily to calcitroic acid and a lactone metabolite</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Excretion: Feces (27%); urine (7%, unchanged in 24 hours)</p><p>Clearance: Children 1.8 to 16 years undergoing peritoneal dialysis: 15.3 mL/hour/kg </p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Oral: 2 hours; maximum effect: 10 hours</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Serum: Oral: 3 to 6 hours; Hemodialysis: 8 to 12 hours</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>Oral, IV: 3 to 5 days</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Children 1.8 to 16 years undergoing peritoneal dialysis: 27.4 hours; Healthy adults: 5 to 8 hours; Hemodialysis: 16 to 22 hours </p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>99.9%</p><h2>Special Populations: Renal Function Impairment</h2><p>The half-life is increased by at least 2-fold.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Hypoparathyroidism/pseudohypoparathyroidism:</b> Management of hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism (oral)</p><p><b>Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease:</b> Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis (oral) or in patients on dialysis (oral or IV). <b>Note:</b> Although the manufacturerâ€™s labeling states that calcitriol may be used specifically to treat hypocalcemia in dialysis patients, due to the risk of hypercalcemia, use should generally be reserved for patients with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism (KDIGO 2017).</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Hypophosphatemia, X-linked (ie, vitamin D-resistant rickets)</h3><p>Clinical experience suggests that calcitriol (in conjunction with phosphate replacement therapy) may be beneficial in select adult patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (eg, those with spontaneous insufficiency fractures or disabling lower extremity skeletal pain, planned/pending orthopedic procedures, biochemical evidence of osteomalacia). Goals of therapy include reduction of pain, improvement of fracture healing, hasten recovery and reduce the risk of prosthetic loosening following joint replacement surgery, and/or reduce the extent of osteomalacia (ie, abundance of unmineralized osteoid present in the skeleton).

Consider discontinuing therapy if clinical improvement is not observed within 9 to 12 months. <b>Note:</b> Calcitriol may be initiated ~1 week prior to initiating phosphate therapy to reduce the risk of exacerbating preexisting secondary hyperparathyroidism or causing it to develop (Carpenter 2011).</p><p><b>Secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD: Note:</b> KDIGO guidelines do not recommend routine use of calcitriol or other vitamin D analogs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages G3 to G5; it may be reasonable to reserve use for patients with CKD stages G4 or G5 and with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism.

KDIGO guidelines recommend initiating with low doses independent of initial PTH concentration and then titrating based on PTH response while avoiding hypercalcemia (KDIGO 2017); the manufacturer recommends an initial dose of 0.25 mcg/day, although lower doses (eg, 0.25 mcg 3 to 4 times weekly) have also been used (Shoben 2012); may increase to 0.5 mcg/day if needed.</p><p><b>Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1/pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets (PDDR) (off-label use):</b> Oral: Initial: 0.5 mcg twice daily; subsequent dosing adjusted to maintain normal serum calcium and PTH levels; median dose after 2 years: 0.25 mcg daily (range: 0.1 to 0.5 mcg daily) (Edouard 2011)</p><p><i><b>Discontinuation of therapy for hypercalcemia:</b></i> Discontinue therapy if hypercalcemia occurs; monitor calcium and phosphorous daily until levels normalize.

Withhold pharmacologic doses of vitamin D and its derivatives during therapy to avoid the potential for hypercalcemia to develop. In addition, several months may be required for ergocalciferol levels to return to baseline in patients switching from ergocalciferol therapy to calcitriol.</p><p>â€¢ Hypercalcemia: Monitor calcium levels closely with initiation of therapy and with dose adjustments; discontinue use promptly in patients who develop hypercalcemia. Avoid abrupt dietary modifications (eg, increased intake of dairy products) which may lead to hypercalcemia; adjust calcium intake if indicated and maintain adequate hydration. Chronic hypercalcemia can result in generalized vascular and soft tissue calcification, exacerbate nephrolithiasis, and has been associated with increased mortality in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (KDIGO 2017). Immobilized patients may be at a higher risk for hypercalcemia.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Malabsorption syndrome: Use oral calcitriol with caution in patients with malabsorption syndromes; efficacy may be limited and/or response may be unpredictable.</p><p>â€¢ Renal impairment: Use of calcitriol for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with CKD is not recommended in patients with rapidly worsening kidney function or in noncompliant patients. Increased serum phosphate levels in patients with renal failure may lead to ectopic calcification; the use of a non-aluminum-containing phosphate-lowering agent is recommended along with a low phosphate diet in patients undergoing dialysis.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Aluminum: The parenteral product may contain aluminum; toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or renal dysfunction. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of &gt;4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses (Federal Register 2002). See manufacturerâ€™s labeling.</p><p>â€¢ Coconut oil: Products may contain coconut oil (capsule).</p><p>â€¢ Palm seed oil: Products may contain palm seed oil (oral solution).</p><p>â€¢ Tartrazine: Some products may contain tartrazine.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>â€¢ Calcium: Adequate dietary (supplemental) calcium is necessary for clinical response to vitamin D.

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Maternal calcitriol may be detected in the fetal circulation. Mild hypercalcemia has been reported in a newborn following maternal use of calcitriol during pregnancy. Adverse effects on fetal development were not observed with use of calcitriol during pregnancy in women (N=9) with pseudovitamin D-dependent rickets. Doses were adjusted every 4 weeks to keep calcium concentrations within normal limits (Edouard 2011). If calcitriol is used for the management of hypoparathyroidism in pregnancy, dose adjustments may be needed as pregnancy progresses and again following delivery. Vitamin D and calcium levels should be monitored closely and kept in the lower normal range (Callies 1998).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>â€¢ It is used to control low blood calcium levels in certain patients.</p><p>â€¢ It is used to treat high parathyroid hormone levels in certain patients.</p><p>â€¢ It may be given to you for other reasons.
