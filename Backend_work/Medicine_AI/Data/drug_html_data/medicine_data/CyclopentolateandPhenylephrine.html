Similarly, Alpha1-Agonists may antagonize Alpha1-Blocker vasodilation.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>AtoMOXetine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. AtoMOXetine may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cannabinoid-Containing Products: May enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cocaine (Topical): May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Consider alternatives to use of this combination when possible. Monitor closely for substantially increased blood pressure or heart rate and for any evidence of myocardial ischemia with concurrent use.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Doxofylline: Sympathomimetics may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Doxofylline. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Ergot Derivatives: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha1-Agonists. Ergot Derivatives may enhance the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha1-Agonists.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Guanethidine: May enhance the arrhythmogenic effect of Sympathomimetics. Guanethidine may enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Iobenguane Radiopharmaceutical Products: Alpha1-Agonists may diminish the therapeutic effect of Iobenguane Radiopharmaceutical Products.  Management: Discontinue all drugs that may inhibit or interfere with catecholamine transport or uptake for at least 5 biological half-lives before iobenguane administration. Do not administer these drugs until at least 7 days after each iobenguane dose.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Linezolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Reduce initial doses of sympathomimetic agents, and closely monitor for enhanced pressor response, in patients receiving linezolid.  Specific dose adjustment recommendations are not presently available.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha1-Agonists. While linezolid is expected to interact via this mechanism, management recommendations differ from other monoamine oxidase inhibitors.  Refer to linezolid specific monographs for details.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Ozanimod: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Concomitant use of ozanimod with sympathomimetic agents is not recommended. If combined, monitor patients closely for the development of hypertension, including hypertensive crises.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Solriamfetol: Sympathomimetics may enhance the hypertensive effect of Solriamfetol. Sympathomimetics may enhance the tachycardic effect of Solriamfetol. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sympathomimetics: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tedizolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics.
