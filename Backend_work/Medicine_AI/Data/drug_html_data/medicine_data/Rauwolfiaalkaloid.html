</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for rauwolfia alkaloid</h2><p>Rauwolfia alkaloids belong to the general class of medicines called antihypertensives. They are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).</p><p>High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloids work by controlling nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, they act on the heart and blood vessels to lower blood pressure.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloids may also be used to treat other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>These medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using rauwolfia alkaloid</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of rauwolfia alkaloids in children with use in other age groups, rauwolfia alkaloids are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than they do in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of rauwolfia alkaloids in the elderly with use in other age groups, dizziness or drowsiness may be more likely to occur in the elderly, who are more sensitive to the effects of rauwolfia alkaloids.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Rauwolfia alkaloids have not been studied in pregnant women. However, too much use of rauwolfia alkaloids during pregnancy may cause unwanted effects (difficult breathing, low temperature, loss of appetite) in the baby. In rats, use of rauwolfia alkaloids during pregnancy causes birth defects and in guinea pigs decreases newborn survival rates. Before taking rauwolfia alkaloid, make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Rauwolfia alkaloids pass into breast milk and may cause unwanted effects (difficult breathing, low temperature, loss of appetite) in infants of mothers taking large doses of rauwolfia alkaloid. Be sure you have discussed this with your doctor before taking rauwolfia alkaloid.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of rauwolfia alkaloid</h2><p>For patients taking rauwolfia alkaloid <i>for high blood pressure</i>:</p><ul>
<li>In addition to the use of the medicine your doctor has prescribed, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and care in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium. Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.</li>
<li>Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.</li>
<li>Remember that rauwolfia alkaloid will not cure your high blood pressure but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease.</li>
</ul><p>To help you remember to take your medicine, try to get into the habit of taking it at the same time each day.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloid is sometimes given together with certain other medicines. If you are using a combination of drugs, make sure that you take each medicine at the proper time and do not mix them. Ask your health care professional to help you plan a way to remember to take your medicines at the right times.</p><p>If rauwolfia alkaloid upsets your stomach, it may be taken with meals or milk. If stomach upset (nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps or pain) continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients.

<li>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes over-the-counter (nonprescription) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, since they may tend to increase your blood pressure.</li>
</ul><p>Before having any kind of surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment, <i>tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are taking rauwolfia alkaloid</i>.</p><p>In some patients, rauwolfia alkaloid may cause mental depression. <i>Tell your doctor right away</i>:</p><ul>
<li>if you or anyone else notices unusual changes in your mood.</li>
<li>if you start having early-morning sleeplessness or unusually vivid dreams or nightmares.</li>
</ul><p>Rauwolfia alkaloid will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that slow down the nervous system, possibly causing drowsiness). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, other allergies, or colds; sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine; prescription pain medicine or narcotics; barbiturates; medicine for seizures; muscle relaxants; or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you are using rauwolfia alkaloid</i>.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloid may cause some people to become drowsy or less alert than they are normally. This is more likely to happen when you begin to take it or when you increase the amount of medicine you are taking. <i>Make sure you know how you react to rauwolfia alkaloid before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert</i>.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloid may cause dryness of the mouth. For temporary relief, use sugarless candy or gum, melt bits of ice in your mouth, or use a saliva substitute. However, if dry mouth continues for more than 2 weeks, check with your medical doctor or dentist. Continuing dryness of the mouth may increase the chance of dental disease, including tooth decay, gum disease, and fungus infections.</p><p>Rauwolfia alkaloid often causes stuffiness in the nose. However, do not use nasal decongestant medicines without first checking with your health care professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Rauwolfia alkaloid side effects</h2><p>Suggestions that rauwolfia alkaloids may increase the risk of breast cancer occurring later have not been proven.
