</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Mangimin</h2><p>Manganese supplements are used to prevent or treat manganese deficiency.</p><p>The body needs manganese for normal growth and health. For patients who are unable to get enough manganese in their regular diet or who have a need for more manganese, manganese supplements may be necessary. Manganese helps your body break down fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. It does so as part of several enzymes.</p><p>Manganese deficiency has not been reported in humans. Lack of manganese in animals has been found to cause improper formation of bone and cartilage, may decrease the body's ability to use sugar properly, and may cause growth problems.</p><p>Injectable manganese supplements are given by or under the supervision of a health care professional.</p><h2>Importance of Diet</h2><p>For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific dietary vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement.</p><p>Manganese is found in whole grains, cereal products, lettuce, dry beans, and peas.</p><p>The daily amount of manganese needed is defined in several different ways.</p><ul>For U.S.—
<li>Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy).</li>
<li>Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DV replaces the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs).</li>
</ul><ul>For Canada—
<li>Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease.</li>
</ul><p>Because a lack of manganese is rare, there is no RDA or RNI for it. The following daily intakes are thought to be plenty for most individuals:</p><ul>
<li>Infants and children—
<ul>
<li>Birth to 3 years of age: 0.3 to 1.5 milligrams (mg).</li>
<li>4 to 6 years of age: 1.5 to 2 mg.</li>
<li>7 to 10 years of age: 2 to 3 mg.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adolescents and adults—2 to 5 mg.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Birth to 3 years of age: 0.3 to 1.5 milligrams (mg).</li>
<li>4 to 6 years of age: 1.5 to 2 mg.</li>
<li>7 to 10 years of age: 2 to 3 mg.</li>

In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of dietary supplements in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
