Add ½ to 1 cup (4 to 8 ounces) of water, fruit juice, or diet soft drinks. Stir well and drink. It is normal for the contents to appear cloudy and fully not dissolved. Take colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension with meals. Do not take colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension in its dry form. Due to tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension is recommended for use in the pediatric population.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with:</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypertriglyceridemia and Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum TG concentrations. Hypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis.</p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride had effects on serum TG (median increase 5% compared to placebo) in trials of patients with primary hyperlipidemia.</p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Obtain lipid</span> parameters, including TG levels, before starting colesevelam hydrochloride and periodically thereafter. Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with TG levels &gt;500 mg/dL or patients with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Patients with TG levels greater than 300 mg/dL could have greater increases in serum TG levels with colesevelam hydrochloride and may require additional TG monitoring. Instruct patients to discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension and seek prompt medical attention if the symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur (e.g., severe abdominal pain with or without nausea and vomiting). Discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension if TG levels exceed 500 mg/dL <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Gastrointestinal Obstruction</h3><p class="First">Postmarketing cases of bowel obstruction have occurred with colesevelam hydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. Because of its constipating effects, colesevelam hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with gastroparesis, other gastrointestinal motility disorders, and in those who have had major gastrointestinal tract surgery and who may be at risk for bowel obstruction. Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with a history of bowel obstruction <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride and seek medical attention if severe abdominal pain or severe constipation occurs.</p><p>Because of the tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride tablets can cause dysphagia or esophageal obstruction. For patients with difficulty swallowing tablets, use colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension.</p><h3>Vitamin K or Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients with a susceptibility to deficiencies of vitamin K (e.g., patients on warfarin, patients with malabsorption syndromes) or other fat-soluble vitamins may be at increased risk when taking colesevelam hydrochloride.</p><p>Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs.

POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed systemically following oral administration, and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug. Limited available data on the use of colesevelam hydrochloride are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of either maternal or fetal toxicity was found in rats or rabbits exposed to colesevelam hydrochloride during the period of fetal organogenesis at 8 and 5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3.75 g/day, based on body surface area (mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). No adverse effects on offspring survival and development were observed in rats administered 5 times the MRHD <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> Colesevelam hydrochloride may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span> There are no data available on the effect of colesevelam hydrochloride on the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in pregnant women. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking colesevelam hydrochloride, the patient should be advised of the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of colesevelam hydrochloride use in pregnant women.

Advise patients to take oral contraceptives at least 4 hours prior to taking colesevelam hydrochloride <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of colesevelam hydrochloride as monotherapy or in combination with a statin were evaluated in children, 10 to 17 years of age, with HeFH <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>. The adverse reaction profile was similar to that of patients treated with placebo. In this limited controlled study, there were no significant effects on growth, sexual maturation, fat-soluble vitamin levels or clotting factors in the adolescent boys or girls relative to placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Due to tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension is recommended for use in the pediatric population. Dose adjustments are not required when colesevelam hydrochloride is administered to children 10 to 17 years of age.</p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride has not been studied in children younger than 10 years of age or in premenarchal girls.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary Hyperlipidemia</span></p><p>Of the 1350 patients enrolled in the hyperlipidemia clinical studies, 349 (26%) were ≥65 years old, and 58 (4%) were ≥75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed and the risk of systemic toxicity is low. Excessive doses of colesevelam hydrochloride may cause more severe local gastrointestinal effects (e.g., constipation).</p><h2>Colesevelam Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">Colesevelam hydrochloride is a non-absorbed, polymeric, lipid-lowering agent for oral administration. Colesevelam hydrochloride is a high-capacity bile acid-binding molecule.</p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride is poly(allylamine hydrochloride) cross-linked with epichlorohydrin and alkylated with 1-bromodecane and (6-bromohexyl)-trimethylammonium bromide. The chemical name (IUPAC) of colesevelam hydrochloride is allylamine polymer with 1-chloro-2,3-epoxypropane, [6-(allylamino)-hexyl]trimethylammonium chloride and N-allyldecylamine, hydrochloride. The chemical structure of colesevelam hydrochloride is represented by the following formula:</p><p>wherein (a) represents allyl amine monomer units that have not been alkylated by either of the 1-bromodecane or (6-bromohexyl)-trimethylammonium bromide alkylating agents or cross-linked by epichlorohydrin; (b) represents allyl amine units that have undergone cross-linking with epichlorohydrin; (c) represents allyl amine units that have been alkylated with a decyl group; (d) represents allyl amine units that have been alkylated with a (6-trimethylammonium) hexyl group, and m represents a number ≥ 100 to indicate an extended polymer network. A small amount of the amines are dialkylated and are not depicted in the formula above. No regular order of the groups is implied by the structure; cross-linking and alkylation are expected to occur randomly along the polymer chains. A large amount of the amines are protonated. The polymer is depicted in the hydrochloride form; a small amount of the halides are bromide. Colesevelam hydrochloride is hydrophilic and insoluble in water.</p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension is a citrus flavored off-white to yellow granular powder packaged in single-dose packets containing either 1.875 gram or 3.75 gram colesevelam hydrochloride. In addition, each packet contains the following inactive ingredients: hydrochloric acid, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, lemon flavor, magnesium trisilicate, mannitol, PB82 natural orange, simethicone emulsion 30%, sorbitol, and sucralose. Lemon flavor consists of flavoring agent and modified food starch. PB82 natural orange consists of flavoring agent and modified food starch.</p><h2>Colesevelam Oral Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Primary Hyperlipidemia:</span> Colesevelam hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension, is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme, cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, is upregulated, which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood, resulting in decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">A maximum therapeutic response to the lipid-lowering effects of colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long-term therapy.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride is a hydrophilic, water-insoluble polymer that is not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and is not absorbed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed, and therefore, its distribution is limited to the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride is not metabolized systemically and does not interfere with systemic drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>In 16 healthy volunteers, an average of 0.05% of administered radioactivity from a single <span class="Sup">14</span>C-labeled colesevelam hydrochloride dose was excreted in the urine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p>Drug interactions between colesevelam and concomitantly administered drugs were screened through <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies and confirmed in <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> studies. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrated that cephalexin, metformin, and ciprofloxacin had negligible binding to colesevelam hydrochloride.
