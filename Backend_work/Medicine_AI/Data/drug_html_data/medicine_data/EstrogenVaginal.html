</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for estrogen</h2><p>Estrogens are hormones produced by the body. Among other things, estrogens help develop and maintain female organs.</p><p>When your body is in short supply of this hormone, replacing it can ease the uncomfortable changes that occur in the vagina, vulva (female genitals), and urethra (part of the urinary system). Conditions that are treated with vaginal estrogens include a genital skin condition (vulvar atrophy), inflammation of the vagina (atrophic vaginitis), and inflammation of the urethra (atrophic urethritis).</p><p>Estrogens work partly by increasing a normal clear discharge from the vagina and making the vulva and urethra healthy. Using or applying an estrogen relieves or lessens:</p><ul>
<li>Dryness and soreness in the vagina</li>
<li>Itching, redness, or soreness of the vulva</li>
<li>Feeling an urge to urinate more often then is needed or experiencing pain while urinating</li>
<li>Pain during sexual intercourse</li>
</ul><p>When used vaginally or on the skin, most estrogens are absorbed into the bloodstream and cause some, but not all, of the same effects as when they are taken by mouth. Estrogens used vaginally at very low doses for treating local problems of the genitals and urinary system will not protect against osteoporosis or stop the hot flushes caused by menopause.</p><p>Estrogens for vaginal use are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using estrogen</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Estrogen vaginal cream is not indicated in children. Studies have not been conducted.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Elderly women greater than 65 years of age may have an increased risk of certain side effects during treatment, especially stroke, invasive breast cancer, and memory problems.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Estrogens should not be used during pregnancy, since an estrogen called diethylstilbestrol (DES) that is no longer taken for hormone replacement has caused serious birth defects in humans and animals.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Use of estrogen is not recommended in nursing mothers. Estrogens pass into the breast milk and may decrease the amount and quality of breast milk. Caution should be exercised in mothers who are using estrogen and breast-feeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of estrogen</h2><p>Vaginal estrogen products usually come with patient directions. <i>Read them carefully before using estrogen</i>.</p><p>Wash your hands before and after using the medicine. Also, keep the medicine out of your eyes. If estrogen does get into your eyes, wash them out immediately, but carefully, with large amounts of tap water. If your eyes still burn or are painful, check with your doctor.</p><p><i>Use estrogen only as directed. Do not use more of it and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered</i>. It can take up to 4 months to see the full effect of the estrogens. Your doctor may reconsider continuing your estrogen treatment or may lower your dose several times within the first one or two months, and every 3 to 6 months after that. Sometimes a switch to oral estrogens may be required for added benefits or for higher doses. When using the estradiol vaginal insert or ring, you will need to replace it every 3 months or remove it after 3 months.</p><p><i>For vaginal creams or suppositories</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Vaginal creams and some vaginal suppositories are inserted with a plastic applicator. Directions for using the applicator are supplied with your medicine. If you do not see your dose marked on the applicator, ask your health care professional for more information.</li>

Do not double doses.</p><p>When using the cream or suppositories more than several times a week: If you miss a dose of estrogen, use it as soon as possible if remembered within 12 hours of the missed dose. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using estrogen</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure estrogen does not cause unwanted effects</i>. Plan on going to see your doctor every year, but some doctors require visits more often.</p><p>It is not yet known whether the use of vaginal estrogens increases the risk of breast cancer in women. It is very important that you check your breasts on a regular basis for any unusual lumps or discharge. Report any problems to your doctor. You should also have a mammogram (x-ray picture of the breasts) done if your doctor recommends it.</p><p>It is important that you have a regular pelvic exam (pap smear). Your doctor will tell you how often this exam should be done.</p><p>Talk to your doctor if you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fats in the blood), or diabetes, use tobacco, or are overweight. You may have a higher risk for getting heart disease.</p><p>Although the chance is low, use of estrogen may increase your chance of getting cancer of the ovary or uterus (womb). Regular visits to your health professional can help identify these serious side effects early.</p><p><i>If you think that you may be pregnant, stop using the medicine immediately and check with your doctor</i>.</p><p>Tell the doctor in charge that you are using estrogen before having any laboratory test, because some test results may be affected.</p><p>For vaginal creams or suppositories:</p><ul>
<li>Avoid using latex condoms, diaphragms, or cervical caps for up to 72 hours after using estrogen vaginal creams. Certain estrogen products may contain oils in the creams that can weaken latex (rubber) products and cause condoms to break or leak, or cervical caps or diaphragms to wear out sooner. Check with your health care professional to make sure the vaginal estrogen product you are using can be used with latex devices.</li>
<li>Estrogen is often used at bedtime to increase effectiveness through better absorption.</li>
<li>Vaginal creams or suppositories will melt and leak out of the vagina. A minipad or sanitary napkin will protect your clothing. Do not use tampons (like those used for menstrual periods) since they may soak up the medicine and make the medicine less effective.</li>
<li>Avoid exposing your male sexual partner to your vaginal estrogen cream or suppository by not having sexual intercourse right after using these medicines. Your male partner might absorb the medicine through his penis if it comes in contact with the medicine.</li>
</ul><p>For estradiol vaginal inserts or rings:</p><ul>
<li>Contact your doctor if you have problems removing your vaginal insert.</li>
<li>It is not necessary to remove the vaginal insert for sexual intercourse unless you prefer to remove it.</li>
<li>If you do take it out, or if it accidentally slips or comes out of the vagina, you can replace the vaginal insert in the vagina after washing it with lukewarm water. Never use hot or boiling water.</li>
<li>If it slips down, gently push it upwards and back into place.</li>
<li>Replace the vaginal insert every 3 months.</li>
<li>Talk to your doctor on a regular basis about how long to use the vaginal insert.</li>
