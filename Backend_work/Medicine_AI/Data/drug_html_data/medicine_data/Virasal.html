The pharmacologic activity of Virasal is generally attributed to the keratolytic activity of salicylic acid which is incorporated into a polyacrylic, film-forming virucidal vehicle designed to cover the wart without the need for a bandage. The structural formula of salicylic acid is:</p><h3>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h3><p class="First">Although the exact mode of action for salicylic acid in the treatment of warts is unknown, its activity appears to be associated with its keratolytic action, which results in mechanical removal of epidermal cells infected with wart viruses.</p><p>The virucidal complex incorporated into Virasal’s proprietary vehicle is designed to help reduce risk of reinfection at the wart site, as well as prevent viral contamination of the product under normal usage.</p><h3>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h3><p class="First">Virasal is indicated for the topical treatment and removal of common warts and plantar warts.</p><h3>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h3><p class="First">Patients with diabetes or impaired blood circulation should not use Virasal. Virasal also should not be used on moles, birthmarks, and unusual warts with hair growing from them, or warts on the face.</p><h3>PRECAUTIONS</h3><p class="First">Virasal is for external use only. Do not permit Virasal to contact eyes or mucous membranes. If contact with eyes or mucous membranes occurs, immediately flush with water for 15 minutes. Virasal should not be allowed to contact normal skin surrounding wart, since localized irritation may occur. Treatment should be discontinued if excessive irritation occurs. Virasal is flammable. Keep away from fire or flame. Keep bottle tightly capped when not in use.</p><h3>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h3><p class="First">A localized irritant reaction may occur if Virasal is applied to the normal skin surrounding the wart. Any irritation may normally be controlled by temporarily discontinuing use and by applying the medication only to the wart site when treatment is resumed.</p><h3>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h3><p class="First">Prior to applying Virasal, soak wart in warm water for five minutes. Remove any loosened tissue by gently rubbing with a brush, wash cloth, or emery board. Dry wart site thoroughly. Using the brush applicator supplied, apply Virasal twice to entire wart surface, allowing the first application to dry before applying the second. Continue treatment once or twice a day as directed by physician. Be careful not to apply to surrounding skin.</p><p>Clinically visible improvement will normally occur during the first or second week of therapy. Maximum resolution may be expected after four to six weeks of Virasal use.</p><h3>HOW SUPPLIED</h3><p class="First">Virasal is supplied in 10ml amber bottles with a brush applicator (NDC 42783-312-10).</p><p>Store at controlled room temperature, 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F).</p><p>Manufactured for:<br/>
