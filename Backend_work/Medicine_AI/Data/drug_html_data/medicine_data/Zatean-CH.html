</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">R<span class="Sub">x</span> Only</span></p><p>The Zatean-CH brand name has been discontinued in the U.S. If generic versions of this product have been approved by the FDA, there may be generic equivalents available.</p><h2>Zatean-CH Description</h2><p class="First">Zatean™-CH is an orally administered prenatal prescription vitamin. Zatean™-CH is a purple, oblong soft gelatin capsule imprinted with "T583".</p><h3>Inactive Ingredients</h3><p class="First">Lecithin, Soybean Oil, Yellow Beeswax, Natural Creamy Orange Flavor, Gelatin, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, FD&amp;C Red #40, FD&amp;C Blue #1, Ethyl Vanillin, Purified Water, and other trace excipients.</p><h2>INDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Zatean™-CH is a multivitamin/mineral prescription drug indicated for use in improving the nutritional status of women prior to conception, throughout pregnancy, and in the postnatal period for both lactating and nonlactating mothers.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients, including fish or fish oil.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Daily ingestion of more than 3 g per day of omega-3 fatty acids (ALA, EPA, and DHA) from fish oils may have potential antithrombotic activities, or effects, and may increase bleeding times. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids - including DHA, should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diatheses, including those taking anticoagulants.</p><h3>WARNING</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">This product contains fish oil and soy products.</span></p><h2>CAUTION</h2><p class="First">Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Folates (including folic acid and reduced folates), when administered as a single agent in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure the detection of B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency (specifically, the administration of folic acid may reverse the hematological manifestations of B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency, including pernicious anemia, while not addressing the neurological manifestations). Reduced folates may be less likely than folic acid to mask vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency. Folate therapy alone is inadequate for the treatment of B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency.</p><h3>PATIENT INFORMATION</h3><p class="First">Zatean™-CH is a prescription prenatal vitamin for use only under medical supervision and direction.</p><h3>INTERACTIONS</h3><ul>
<li>First generation anticonvulsants: High dose folic acid may result in decreased serum levels for first generation anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, valproic acid, valproate). This may possibly reduce the effectiveness of first generation anticonvulsants and/or increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible patients. Caution should be used when prescribing folates among patients who are receiving treatment with first generation anticonvulsants.</li>
<li>Second-generation anticonvulsants: Information on the effect of second-generation anticonvulsants (including, but not limited to, lamotrigine) on folate levels is limited and cannot be ruled out.</li>
<li>Capecitabine: Folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) may increase the toxicity of capecitabine.</li>
<li>Cholestyramine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Colestipol: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Colchicine: Colchicine may decrease folate plasma levels.</li>
<li>L-dopa: L-dopa may decrease folate plasma levels.</li>
<li>Cycloserine: Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels.</li>
<li>Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitors (DHFRI): DHFRIs block the conversion of folic acid to its active forms, and lower plasma and red blood cell folate levels. DHFRIs include aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, triamterene, and trimethoprim. Caution should be exercised when using folate with folate antagonists. Patients, typically, should not be given folate simultaneously with a folate antagonist, for the purpose of reducing or preventing clinical toxicity, as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified.</li>
<li>Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine exerts a noncompetitive inhibition of the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate active transport in the intestine.</li>
<li>Isotretinoin: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking isotretinoin.</li>
<li>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit some folate dependent enzymes in laboratory experiments. NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and sulindac.</li>
<li>Oral Contraceptives: Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.</li>
<li>Methylprednisolone: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted after treatment with methylprednisolone.</li>
<li>Pancreatic Enzymes, including, but not limited to pancreatin and pancrelipase: Reduced folate levels have occurred in some patients taking pancreatic extracts.</li>
<li>Pentamidine: Reduced folate levels have been seen with prolonged intravenous pentamidine.</li>
<li>Smoking and Alcohol: Reduced serum folate levels have been noted.</li>
<li>Sulfasalazine: Inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid.</li>
<li>Metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes decreases serum folate.</li>
<li>Warfarin can produce significant impairment in folate status after a 6-month therapy.</li>
<li>Folate may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil.</li>
<li>Concurrent administration of chloramphenicol and folate in folate-deficient patients may result in antagonism of the haematopoietic response to folate.</li>
<li>Caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of folate and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection as it is associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study.</li>
</ul><p class="First">Pyridoxine hydrochloride should not be given to patients receiving the drug levodopa, because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine hydrochloride. However, pyridoxine hydrochloride may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid, as well as possibly the use of other forms of folates - including reduced folates.</p><h2>Zatean-CH Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">One capsule daily or as directed by a physician.</p><h2>How is Zatean-CH Supplied</h2><p class="First">Zatean™-CH is supplied in bottles of 30 capsules each.</p><p>NDC 13811-583-30</p><h3>STORAGE</h3><p class="First">Store at controlled room temperature 15°-30°C (59°-86°F).
