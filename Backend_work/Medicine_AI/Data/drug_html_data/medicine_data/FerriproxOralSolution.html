</ul><h2>Ferriprox Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Starting Dose</span></p><p>The recommended initial dose of FERRIPROX is 25 mg/kg actual body weight, orally, three times per day for a total of 75 mg/kg/day. Round dose to the nearest 2.5 mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dose Adjustments</span></p><p>Tailor dose adjustments to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals (maintenance or reduction of body iron burden). The maximum dose is 33 mg/kg actual body weight, three times per day for a total of 99 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Monitor serum ferritin concentration every two to three months to assess the effect of FERRIPROX on body iron stores. If the serum ferritin is consistently below 500 mcg/L, consider temporarily interrupting FERRIPROX therapy until serum ferritin rises above 500 mcg/L.</p><h3>Dosage Modification for Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Allow at least a 4-hour interval between administration of FERRIPROX and other drugs or supplements containing polyvalent cations such as iron, aluminum, or zinc <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Oral Solution: 100 mg/mL (50 g/500 mL), clear, reddish orange colored solution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">FERRIPROX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to deferiprone or to any of the excipients in the formulation. The following reactions have been reported in association with the administration of deferiprone: Henoch-Schönlein purpura; urticaria; and periorbital edema with skin rash <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Agranulocytosis and Neutropenia</h3><p class="First">Fatal agranulocytosis can occur with FERRIPROX use. FERRIPROX can also cause neutropenia, which may foreshadow agranulocytosis. Measure the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) before starting FERRIPROX therapy and monitor it weekly while on therapy.</p><p>Interrupt FERRIPROX therapy if neutropenia develops (ANC &lt; 1.5 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L).</p><p>Interrupt FERRIPROX if infection develops and monitor the ANC frequently.</p><p>Advise patients taking FERRIPROX to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative of infection.</p><p>In pooled clinical trials, the incidence of agranulocytosis was 1.7% of patients. The mechanism of FERRIPROX-associated agranulocytosis is unknown. Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon discontinuation of FERRIPROX, but there have been reports of agranulocytosis leading to death.</p><p>Implement a plan to monitor for and to manage agranulocytosis and neutropenia prior to initiating FERRIPROX treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">For agranulocytosis (ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L):</span></p><p>Consider hospitalization and other management as clinically appropriate.</p><p>Do not resume FERRIPROX in patients who have developed agranulocytosis unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks. Do not rechallenge patients who have developed neutropenia with FERRIPROX unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks.</p><p><span class="Bold">For neutropenia (ANC &lt; 1.5 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L and &gt; 0.5 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L):</span></p><p>Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue FERRIPROX and all other medications with a potential to cause neutropenia.</p><p>Obtain a complete blood cell (CBC) count, including a white blood cell (WBC) count corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and a platelet count daily until recovery (ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10<span class="Sup">9</span>/L).</p><h3>Liver Enzyme Elevations</h3><p class="First">In clinical studies, 7.5% of 642 patients treated with FERRIPROX developed increased ALT values. Four (0.62%) FERRIPROX-treated subjects discontinued the drug due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 (0.16%) due to an increase in both ALT and AST.</p><p>Monitor serum ALT values monthly during therapy with FERRIPROX and consider interruption of therapy if there is a persistent increase in the serum transaminase levels.</p><h3>Zinc Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Decreased plasma zinc concentrations have been observed on FERRIPROX therapy. Monitor plasma zinc, and supplement in the event of a deficiency.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and evidence of genotoxicity, FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The available data on the use of FERRIPROX in pregnant women are insufficient to inform risk. In animal studies, administration of deferiprone during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death and malformations at doses lower than equivalent human clinical doses. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p>Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least six months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least three months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Agranulocytosis and Neutropenia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Liver Enzyme Elevations <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Zinc Deficiency <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Adverse reaction information for FERRIPROX represents the pooled data collected from 642 patients who participated in single arm or active-controlled clinical trials.</p><p>The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical trials with FERRIPROX was agranulocytosis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, alanine aminotransferase increased, arthralgia and neutropenia.</p><p>The table below lists the adverse drug reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with FERRIPROX in clinical trials.</p><p>Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were the most frequent adverse reactions reported by patients participating in clinical trials and led to the discontinuation of FERRIPROX therapy in 1.6% of patients.</p><p>Chromaturia (reddish/brown discoloration of the urine) is a result of the excretion of iron in the urine.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving FERRIPROX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and lymphatic system disorders:</span> thrombocytosis, pancytopenia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiac disorders:</span> atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Congenital, familial and genetic disorders:</span> hypospadias.</p><p><span class="Italics">Eye disorders:</span> diplopia, papilledema, retinal toxicity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal disorders:</span> enterocolitis, rectal hemorrhage, gastric ulcer, pancreatitis, parotid gland enlargement.</p><p><span class="Italics">General disorders and administration site conditions:</span> chills, pyrexia, edema peripheral, multi-organ failure.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatobiliary disorders:</span> jaundice, hepatomegaly.</p><p><span class="Italics">Immune system disorders: a</span>naphylactic shock, hypersensitivity.</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and infestations:</span> cryptococcal cutaneous infection, enteroviral encephalitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, sepsis, furuncle, infectious hepatitis, rash pustular, subcutaneous abscess.</p><p><span class="Italics">Investigations:</span> blood bilirubin increased, blood creatinine phosphokinase increased.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and nutrition disorders:</span> metabolic acidosis, dehydration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:</span> myositis, chondropathy, trismus.</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous system disorders:</span> cerebellar syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, convulsion, gait disturbance, intracranial pressure increased, psychomotor skills impaired, pyramidal tract syndrome, somnolence.</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric disorders:</span>bruxism, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal disorders:</span>glycosuria, hemoglobinuria.</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders:</span> acute respiratory distress syndrome, epistaxis, hemoptysis, pulmonary embolism.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin, subcutaneous tissue disorders:</span>hyperhidrosis, periorbital edema, photosensitivity reaction, pruritis, urticaria, rash, Henoch-Schönlein purpura.</p><p><span class="Italics">Vascular disorders:</span>hypotension, hypertension.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs Associated with Neutropenia or Agranulocytosis</h3><p class="First">Avoid co-administration of FERRIPROX with other drugs known to be associated with neutropenia or agranulocytosis. If co-administration is unavoidable, closely monitor the absolute neutrophil count <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on FERRIPROX</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)</span></p><p>Avoid co-administration of FERRIPROX with a UGT1A6 inhibitor (e.g., diclofenac, probenecid, or silymarin (milk thistle)) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Polyvalent Cations</span></p><p>Deferiprone has the potential to bind polyvalent cations (e.g., iron, aluminum, and zinc); allow at least a 4-hour interval between administration of FERRIPROX and other medications (e.g., antacids) or supplements containing these polyvalent cations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of deferiprone to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 33% and 49%, respectively, of the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) resulted in structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal mortality and alterations to growth (see Data). The limited data from FERRIPROX use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage. Based on evidence of genotoxicity and developmental toxicity in animal studies, FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Post-marketing data available from 39 pregnancies of FERRIPROX-treated patients and 10 pregnancies of partners of FERRIPROX-treated patients are as follows:</p><p>Of the 39 pregnancies in FERRIPROX-treated patients, 23 resulted in healthy newborns, 6 ended in spontaneous abortion, 9 had unknown outcomes, and 1 infant was born with anal atresia, nephroptosis, ventricular septal defect, hemivertebra and urethral fistula.</p><p>Of the 10 pregnancies in partners of FERRIPROX-treated patients, 5 resulted in healthy newborns, 1 resulted in a healthy newborn with slight hypospadias, 1 was electively terminated, 1 resulted in the intrauterine death of twins, and 2 had unknown outcomes.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>During organogenesis, pregnant rats and rabbits received deferiprone at oral doses of 0, 30, 80 or 200 mg/kg/day, and 0, 10, 50, or 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. The daily dose was administered as two equal divided doses approximately 7 hours apart. Doses of 200 mg/kg/day in rats and 150 mg/kg/day in rabbits, approximately 33% and 49% of the MRHD, respectively, resulted in increased post-implantation loss and reduced fetal weights in the presence of maternal toxicity (reduced maternal body weight and body weight gain in both rats and rabbits; abnormal large placenta at low incidence in rats). The 200 mg/kg/day dose in rats resulted in external, visceral and skeletal fetal malformations, such as cranial malformations, cleft palate, limb malrotation, anal atresia, internal hydrocephaly, anophthalmia, and fused bones. The dose of 150 mg/kg/day in rabbits resulted in external fetal malformations (partially opened eyes) and minor blood vessel and skeletal variations.</p><p>In rats, malformations including micrognathia and persistent ductus arteriosus could be observed in the absence of maternal toxicity at doses equal to or greater than 30 and 80 mg/kg/day, approximately 5% and 13% of the MHRD, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of deferiprone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.</p><p>Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for deferiprone in animal studies, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with FERRIPROX, and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span></p><p>Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating FERRIPROX.</p><p><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Females</span></p><p>FERRIPROX can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least 6 months after the last dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Males</span></p><p>Based on genotoxicity findings, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least 3 months after the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of FERRIPROX in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of FERRIPROX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">No cases of acute overdose have been reported. There is no specific antidote to FERRIPROX overdose.</p><p>Neurological disorders such as cerebellar symptoms, diplopia, lateral nystagmus, psychomotor slowdown, hand movements and axial hypotonia have been observed in children treated with 2.5 to 3 times the recommended dose for more than one year. The neurological disorders progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation.</p><h2>Ferriprox Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">FERRIPROX (deferiprone) oral solution contains 100 mg/mL deferiprone (3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one), a synthetic, orally active, iron-chelating agent. The molecular formula for deferiprone is C<span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">9</span>NO<span class="Sub">2</span> and its molecular weight is 139.15 g/mol. Deferiprone has the following structural formula:</p><p> </p><p>Deferiprone is a white to pinkish-white powder. It is sparingly soluble in deionized water and has a melting point range of 272 °C - 278 °C.</p><p>Ferriprox Oral Solution is a clear, reddish orange colored solution. Each mL of oral solution contains 100 mg deferiprone and the following inactive ingredients: purified water, hydroxyethylcellulose, glycerin, hydrochloric acid, artificial cherry flavor, peppermint oil, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6, and sucralose.</p><h2>Ferriprox Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Deferiprone is a chelating agent that binds with ferric ions (iron III) to form neutral 3:1 (deferiprone:iron) complexes that are stable over a wide range of pH values. Deferiprone has a lower binding affinity for other metals (e.g., copper, aluminum and zinc) than for iron.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Deferiprone exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response are unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>At a dose 1.5 times the maximum approved recommended dosage, FERRIPROX does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of deferiprone was 20 mcg/mL and 50 mcg∙h/mL, respectively, in healthy subjects. The dose proportionality of deferiprone over the approved recommended dosage range is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Deferiprone appeared in the blood within 5 to 10 minutes after oral administration. Peak serum concentration of deferiprone was reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after a single dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone were observed following administration with food.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The elimination half-life of deferiprone is approximately 2 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Deferiprone is metabolized primarily by UGT1A6. The major metabolite of deferiprone is the 3-<span class="Italics">O</span>-glucuronide, which lacks iron binding capability.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Following oral administration, 75% to 90% of the administered dose was recovered in urine (primarily as metabolite) in the first 24 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone were observed based on sex, race/ethnicity, body weight, mild to severe (eGFR 15 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) renal impairment, or mild (Child Pugh Class A) to moderate (Child Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. The effect of age, including geriatric or pediatric populations, end stage renal disease, or severe (Child Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In Vitro Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">UGT1A6 Inhibitors:</span> Co-administration of deferiprone with phenylbutazone (UGT1A6 inhibitor) decreased glucuronidation of deferiprone by up to 78%.</p><p><span class="Italics">Polyvalent Cations:</span> Deferiprone has the potential to bind polyvalent cations (e.g., iron, aluminum, and zinc).</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with deferiprone. However, in view of the genotoxicity results, and the findings of mammary gland hyperplasia and mammary gland tumors in rats treated with deferiprone in the 52-week toxicology study, tumor formation in carcinogenicity studies must be regarded as likely.</p><p>Deferiprone was positive in a mouse lymphoma cell assay <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. Deferiprone was clastogenic in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosomal aberration test in mice and in a chromosomal aberration test in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Deferiprone given orally or intraperitoneally was clastogenic in a bone marrow micronucleus assay in non-iron-loaded mice. A micronucleus test was also positive when mice predosed with iron dextran were treated with deferiprone. Deferiprone was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation test.</p><p>A fertility and early embryonic development study of deferiprone was conducted in rats. Sperm counts, motility and morphology were unaffected by treatment with deferiprone. There were no effects observed on male or female fertility or reproductive function at the highest dose which was 25% of the MRHD.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Transfusional Iron Overload</span></p><p>In a prospective, planned, pooled analysis of patients from several studies, the efficacy of FERRIPROX was assessed in transfusion-dependent iron overload patients in whom previous iron chelation therapy had failed or was considered inadequate due to poor tolerance. The main criterion for chelation failure was serum ferritin &gt; 2,500 mcg/L before treatment with FERRIPROX. FERRIPROX therapy (35-99 mg/kg/day) was considered successful in individual patients who experienced a ≥ 20% decline in serum ferritin within one year of starting therapy.</p><p>Data from a total of 236 patients were analyzed. Of the 224 patients with thalassemia who received deferiprone monotherapy and were eligible for serum ferritin analysis, 105 (47%) were male and 119 (53%) were female. The mean age of these patients was 18.2 years.</p><p>For the patients in the analysis, the endpoint of at least a 20% reduction in serum ferritin was met in 50% (of 236 subjects), with a 95% confidence interval of 43% to 57%.</p><p>A small number of patients with thalassemia and iron overload were assessed by measuring the change in the number of milliseconds (ms) in the cardiac MRI T2* value before and after treatment with deferiprone for one year. There was an increase in cardiac MRI T2* from a mean at baseline of 11.8 ± 4.9 ms to a mean of 15.1 ± 7.0 ms after approximately one year of treatment. The clinical significance of this observation is not known.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">FERRIPROX<span class="Sup">®</span> (deferiprone) oral solution is provided in amber polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles with child resistant closures (polypropylene).

<li>Instruct patients and their caregivers that Ferriprox Oral Solution is light sensitive and to store Ferriprox Oral Solution in the originally supplied bottle and carton. Store at 20 °C to 25 °C (68 °F to 77 °F); excursions permitted to 15 °C to 30 °C (59 °F to 86 °F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Instruct patients and their caregivers to store FERRIPROX out of the reach and sight of children.</li>
<li>Inform patients of the risks of developing agranulocytosis and instruct them to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms of infection such as fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms.</li>
<li>Inform patients that their blood will be checked to monitor liver function and zinc levels. A zinc supplement may be prescribed if zinc levels are low.</li>
<li>Advise patients to use the measuring cup provided with FERRIPROX to measure the volume prescribed. Instruct patients to add about 10-15 mL of water to the measuring cup and swirl it around to mix the water with any remaining medicine in the cup and drink the mixture. The measuring cup should be hand-washed with water after use.</li>
<li>Advise patients to take the first dose of FERRIPROX in the morning, the second dose at midday, and the third dose in the evening. Clinical experience suggests that taking FERRIPROX with meals may reduce nausea. If a dose of this medicine has been missed, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not catch-up or double doses.</li>
<li>Advise patients to contact their physician in the event of overdose.</li>
<li>Inform patients that their urine might show a reddish/brown discoloration due to the excretion of iron. This is a very common sign of the desired effect of FERRIPROX, and it is not harmful.</li>

One type of white blood cell that is important for fighting infections is called a neutrophil. If your neutrophil count is low (neutropenia), you may be at risk of developing a serious infection that can lead to death. Neutropenia is common with FERRIPROX and can become severe in some people. Severe neutropenia is known as agranulocytosis. If you develop agranulocytosis, you will be at risk of developing serious infections that can lead to death.</p><p>Your healthcare provider should do a blood test before you start FERRIPROX and weekly during treatment to check your neutrophil count. If you develop neutropenia, your healthcare provider should check your blood counts every day until your white blood cell count improves. Your healthcare provider may temporarily stop treatment with FERRIPROX if you develop neutropenia or infection.</p><p>Stop taking FERRIPROX and get medical help right away if you develop any of these symptoms of infection:</p><ul class="Disk">
