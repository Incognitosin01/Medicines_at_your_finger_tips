You may also develop a serious condition called <b>lactic acidosis</b> if you take atazanavir and cobicistat with certain other HIV medicines during pregnancy. <b>Tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.</b> You may need to use a different antiviral medicine.</p><p>Use your medications properly to control your infection. HIV can be passed to your baby if the virus is not controlled during pregnancy. Your name may be listed on a registry to track any effects of antiviral medicine on the baby.</p><p>Atazanavir and cobicistat can make hormonal birth control less effective, including birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings. <b>To prevent pregnancy while using  atazanavir and cobicistat,</b> use a barrier form of birth control: condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breastfeed a baby.

Every person with HIV should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>Store in the original container at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.</p><p>Get your prescription refilled before you run out of medicine completely. Missing doses may increase the risk of your virus becoming resistant to medication.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking atazanavir and cobicistat?</h2><p>Using  atazanavir and cobicistat may not prevent your disease from spreading.
