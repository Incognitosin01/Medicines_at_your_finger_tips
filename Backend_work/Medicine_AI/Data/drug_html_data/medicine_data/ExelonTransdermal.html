</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Central Nervous System Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Cholinesterase Inhibitor, Centrally Acting</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Exelon</h2><p>Rivastigmine patch is used to treat dementia (memory loss) associated with mild, moderate, or severe Alzheimer's disease, or mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Rivastigmine will not cure these diseases and it will not stop these diseases from getting worse. However, rivastigmine can improve thinking ability in some patients with these diseases.</p><p>In Alzheimer's disease, many chemical changes take place in the brain. One of the earliest and biggest changes is that there is a decrease in a chemical called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh helps the brain to work properly. Rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It slows the breakdown of ACh, so it can build up and have a greater effect. However, as Alzheimer's disease gets worse, there will be less and less ACh, so rivastigmine may not work as well.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Exelon</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
