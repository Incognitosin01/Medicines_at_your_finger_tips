It is a local anesthetic.</p><p>Bupivacaine injection causes a loss of feeling and prevents pain by blocking signals at the nerve endings. It does not cause loss of consciousness.</p><p>Bupivacaine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using bupivacaine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For bupivacaine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to bupivacaine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of bupivacaine injection in the pediatric population. Use is not recommended in children younger than 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of bupivacaine injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have low blood pressure or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving bupivacaine injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving bupivacaine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using bupivacaine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of bupivacaine</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you bupivacaine in a hospital. It is sometimes given through a catheter placed into your lower back for an epidural or a spinal block.</p><p>Bupivacaine should cause numbness only to the area where it is injected. You may experience temporary loss of sensation or movement in the injected area. This type of numbing procedure is called local anesthesia. It is not meant to cause you to fall asleep or become unconscious.</p><p>You may experience temporary loss of sensation and movement, usually in the lower half of your body, if you receive bupivacaine into your lower back (epidural). It may be easier to hurt yourself while your treated body area is still numb. Be careful to avoid injury until you have regained all the feeling and are no longer numb.</p><p>To avoid injury after dental work, do not chew solid foods until normal feeling has returned to the area. Do not test the feeling in your mouth by biting or poking the treated area (up to 7 hours).</p><p>If you are receiving bupivacaine as an epidural <i>to ease labor pains</i>, it may take longer than normal for you to push your baby out. It is also possible that the baby may have unwanted effects after birth (including sleepiness, slow responses). Talk to your doctor if you have questions about how bupivacaine might affect your baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using bupivacaine</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress closely while receiving bupivacaine</i> to see if it is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for any unwanted effects.</p><p>Bupivacaine may cause a rare, but serious blood problem called methemoglobinemia. The risk may be increased in children younger than 6 months of age, elderly patients, or patients with certain inborn defects. It is more likely to occur in patients receiving too much of the medicine, but can also occur with small amounts. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child has the following symptoms after receiving bupivacaine: pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nails, confusion, headache, lightheadedness, fast heartbeat, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Bupivacaine may cause a bone or joint problem called chondrolysis. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have bone or joint pain or stiffness or an inability to move.</p><p>Bupivacaine may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). This is more likely in patients with blood vessel problems, including high blood pressure (hypertension) or a decrease in blood volume. Check with your doctor right away if you have confusion, dizziness, faintness, or lightheadedness when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting position, sweating, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Bupivacaine injection may also cause a dangerous increase in body temperature (hyperthermia). Check with your doctor if you or your child have fast shallow breathing, a fast, weak heartbeat, headache, muscle cramps, pale, clammy skin, or an extremely high fever or body temperature.</p><p>Bupivacaine may make you dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how bupivacaine affects you.</p><p>Check with your doctor before receiving bupivacaine with other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The use of other medicines that affect the CNS with bupivacaine injection may worsen the side effects of bupivacaine, such as dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, or muscle relaxants.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Bupivacaine side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
