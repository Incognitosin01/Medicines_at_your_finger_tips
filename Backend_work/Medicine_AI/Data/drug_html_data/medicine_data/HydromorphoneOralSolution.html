</ul><h2>Hydromorphone Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume.</p><p>Instruct patients to obtain a calibrated measuring cup/syringe for administering hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution to ensure that the dose is measured and administered accurately.</p><p>Do not use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, as using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon could lead to overdosage <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disk">
<li>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disk">
<li>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and adjust the dosage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.4</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h3>Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Initiating Treatment with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution</span></p><p>Initiate treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a dosing range of one-half (2.5 mL) to two teaspoonsful (10 mL), 2.5 mg to 10 mg, every 3 to 6 hours as needed for pain.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution</span></p><p>There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.</p><p>In general, it is safest to start hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 3 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. The dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.4</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to Extended-Release </span><span class="Bold">Hydromorphone Hydrochloride</span></p><p>The relative bioavailability of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution compared to extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution starting dose depending on the degree of impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.6</span><span class="Italics">), and Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution starting dose depending on the degree of impairment <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.7</span><span class="Italics">), and Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Individually titrate hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.</p><p>If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><p>For chronic pain, doses should be administered around-the-clock. A supplemental dose of 5 to 15% of the total daily usage may be administered every two hours on an as-needed basis.</p><h3>Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</p><p>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</p><p>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</p><p>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</p><p>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, USP is a clear, colorless liquid. It is available in: Bottles of 1 pint (473 mL).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">

Ensure that the dose is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. Given the inexactitude of the household spoon measure and the possibility of using a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, which could lead to overdosage, the enclosed measuring device should be used or a calibrated measuring device obtained from the pharmacist. Healthcare providers should recommend a calibrated device that can measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately, and instruct caregivers to use extreme caution in measuring the dosage<span class="Bold">.</span></p><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (</span><span class="Italics">9</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, and monitor all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)</h3><p class="First">To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Complete a <span class="Bold">REMS-compliant education program</span> offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disk">
<li>Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disk">
<li>Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disk">
<li>Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (</span><span class="Italics">10</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution is essential <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone.</p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">), Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined.  Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">), Patient Counseling Information (</span><span class="Italics">17</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:</span> Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.4</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:</span> Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and when hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.4</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (</span><span class="Italics">7</span><span class="Italics">)].</span> Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. In patients with circulatory shock, hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution therapy.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><p>Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery</h3><p class="First">Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and know how they will react to the medication.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections:</p><ul class="Disc">

The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.5</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported.</p><p>Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights). There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported.</p><p>In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area). The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity. No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day).</p><p>In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10). Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area. The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity.</p><p>Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively). Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Low levels of opioid analgesics have been detected in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydromorphone is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p>Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">), Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.2</span><span class="Italics">), Nonclinical Toxicology (</span><span class="Italics">13.1</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.7</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p>Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by hepatic impairment. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with hepatic impairment should be started at one-fourth to one-half the recommended starting dose depending on the degree of hepatic dysfunction and closely monitored during dose titration. The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. A further increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected and should be taken into consideration when selecting a starting dose <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone is affected by renal impairment. In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment, hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with a longer terminal elimination half-life. Start patients with renal impairment on one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose depending on the degree of impairment. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.3</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution contains hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution contains hydromorphone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, oxymorphone and tapentadol. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</span><span class="Italics">5.2</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful recordkeeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution</span></p><p>Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution is for oral use only. Abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution poses a risk of overdose and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.</p><p>Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</p><p>When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]</span>.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.1</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdose with hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (</span><span class="Italics">12.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydromorphone overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Hydromorphone Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Hydromorphone Hydrochloride, a hydrogenated ketone of morphine, is an opioid agonist.</p><p>Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is supplied as 5 mg/5 mL (1 mg/mL) viscous liquid.</p><p>The chemical name is 4,5α-epoxy-3-hydroxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-one hydrochloride. The molecular weight is 321.80. Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>·HCl, and it has the following chemical structure:</p><p>Hydromorphone hydrochloride is a white or almost white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in water, very slightly soluble in ethanol (96%), and practically insoluble in methylene chloride.</p><p>Each 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution contains 5 mg of hydromorphone hydrochloride. In addition, other ingredients include sucrose, glycerin, methylparaben, propylparaben, and purified water.</p><h2>Hydromorphone Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation.</p><p>Hydromorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Hydromorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (</span><span class="Italics">6.2</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Efficacy Relationships</span></p><p>The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of hydromorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.1</span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">2.5</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing hydromorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (</span><span class="Italics">2.2</span><span class="Italics">, <span class="Italics">2.3</span></span><span class="Italics">,</span> <span class="Italics">2.5</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span>) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg TABLET and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated.</p><p>After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within ½ to 1 hour.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mean (%cv)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Dosage Form</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C</span> <span class="Bold">max</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T</span> <span class="Bold">max</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">T <span class="Sub">½</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(ng)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(hrs)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(ng*hr/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">(hrs)</span></p><p class="First">8 mg Tablet</p><p class="First">5.5 (33%)</p><p class="First">0.74 (34%)</p><p class="First">23.7 (28%)</p><p class="First">2.6 (18%)</p><p class="First">8 mg Oral Liquid</p><p class="First">5.7 (31%)</p><p class="First">0.73 (71%)</p><p class="First">24.6 (29%)</p><p class="First">2.8 (20%)</p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effects</span></p><p>In a study conducted with a single 8 mg dose of hydromorphone (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), food lowered C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 25%, prolonged T<span class="Sub">max</span> by 0.8 hour, and increased AUC by 35%. The effects may not be clinically relevant.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>At therapeutic plasma levels, hydromorphone is approximately 8 to 19% bound to plasma proteins. After an intravenous bolus dose, the steady state of volume distribution [mean (% cv)] is 302.9 (32%) liters.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The systemic clearance is approximately 1.96 (20%) liters/minute. The terminal elimination half-life of hydromorphone after an intravenous dose is about 2.3 hours.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, with greater than 95% of the dose metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Only a small amount of the hydromorphone dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Most of the dose is excreted as hydromorphone-3-glucuronide along with minor amounts of 6-hydroxy reduction metabolites.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), mean exposure to hydromorphone (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC∞) is increased 4-fold in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Group B) hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.6</span><span class="Italics">)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>After oral administration of a single 4 mg dose (2 mg hydromorphone immediate-release tablets), exposure to hydromorphone (C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-48</span>) is increased in patients with impaired renal function by 2-fold in moderate (CLcr = 40 to 60 mL/min) and 3-fold in severe (CLcr &lt; 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared with normal subjects (CLcr &gt; 80 mL/min). In addition, in patients with severe renal impairment hydromorphone appeared to be more slowly eliminated with longer terminal elimination half-life (40 hr) compared to patients with normal renal function (15 hr). Patients with moderate renal impairment should be started on a lower dose. Starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment should be even lower. Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored during dose titration <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (</span><span class="Italics">8.7</span><span class="Italics">)].</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Age: Geriatric Population</span></p><p>In the geriatric population, age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone.</p><p><span class="Italics">Sex</span></p><p>Sex has little effect on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone. Females appear to have higher C<span class="Sub">max</span> (25%) than males with comparable AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> values.
