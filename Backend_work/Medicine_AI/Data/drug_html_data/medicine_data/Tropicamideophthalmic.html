This dilates (widens) the pupil so that it does not react (narrow) when your doctor shines an examination light into your eye.</p><p>Tropicamide ophthalmic (for the eyes) is used to dilate the pupil for an eye examination or other diagnostic procedure.</p><p>Tropicamide ophthalmic may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Protect your eyes from bright light while your pupils are dilated.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use tropicamide ophthalmic if you are allergic to it.</p><p>To make sure  tropicamide ophthalmic is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>glaucoma; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any drug allergies.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>glaucoma; or</p><p>any drug allergies.</p><p>It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant.</p><p>It is not known whether tropicamide ophthalmic passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>Do not give this medicine to a child without medical advice.</p><h2>How should I use tropicamide ophthalmic?</h2><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not use this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Tropicamide ophthalmic is most often used only in a doctor's office during an eye examination. Instructions are provided below for giving yourself the medicine if your doctor has prescribed it for home use.</p><p>Do not take by mouth. Tropicamide ophthalmic is for use only in the eyes.</p><p>Do not use this medicine while wearing contact lenses. Tropicamide ophthalmic may contain a preservative that can discolor soft contact lenses. It may be best to wait until your eyes are no longer dilated before putting in your contact lenses.</p><p>Wash your hands before and after using the eye drops. <b>Because a child might rub his or her eyes after the drops are given, wash the child's hands after use.</b></p><p>To apply the eye drops:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Tilt your head back slightly and pull down your lower eyelid to create a small pocket. Hold the dropper above the eye with the tip down. Look up and away from the dropper and squeeze out a drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eyes for 2 or 3 minutes with your head tipped down, without blinking or squinting. Gently press your finger to the inside corner of the eye for 1 to 3 minutes, to keep the liquid from draining into your tear duct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use only the number of drops your doctor has prescribed. If you use more than one drop, wait about 5 minutes between drops.</p>

Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since tropicamide ophthalmic is usually given only during an eye exam, it is not likely that you will be on a dosing schedule.</p><p>If you are on a schedule, apply the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of tropicamide ophthalmic is not expected to be dangerous.
