Flush Heparin Lock (Hep-Lock) through which Gammaked was administered with 5% dextrose in water (D5/W) or 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, and do not flush with Heparin. See table below.                           </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Do not mix with immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products from other manufacturers.</li>
<li>Do not use after expiration date.</li>
</ul><h3>PI</h3><p class="First">As there are significant differences in the half-life of IgG among patients with primary humoral immunodeficiencies, the ideal frequency and amount of immunoglobulin therapy may vary from patient to patient. The proper amount can be determined by monitoring clinical response.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Intravenous (IV)</span><br/>
<br/></span> The dose of Gammaked for patients with PI is 300 mg/kg to 600 mg/kg body weight (3 mL/kg to 6 mL/kg) administered every 3 to 4 weeks. The dosage may be adjusted over time to achieve the desired trough levels and clinical responses.</p><p>The recommended initial infusion rate is 1 mg/kg/min (0.01 mL/kg/min). If the infusion is well-tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/min (0.08 mL/kg/min). For patients judged to be at risk for renal dysfunction or thrombosis, administer Gammaked at the minimum infusion rate practicable. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2,5.4)]</span></p><p>If a patient routinely receives a dose of less than 400 mg/kg of Gammaked every 3 to 4 weeks (less than 4 mL/kg), and is at risk of measles exposure (i.e., traveling to a measles endemic area), administer a dose of at least 400 mg/kg (4 mL/kg) just prior to the expected measles exposure. If a patient has been exposed to measles, a dose of 400 mg/kg (4 mL/kg) should be administered as soon as possible after exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous (SC</span>)<br/></span><br/>
The dose should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical response to Gammaked therapy and serum IgG trough levels. Begin treatment with Gammaked one week after the patient’s last IGIV infusion. See below under "Initial Weekly Dose". Prior to switching treatment from IGIV to Gammaked, obtain the patient’s serum IgG trough level to guide subsequent dose adjustments. See below under "Dose Adjustment".</p><p>Establish the initial weekly dose of Gammaked by converting the monthly IGIV dose into a weekly equivalent and increasing it using a dose adjustment factor. The goal is to achieve a systemic serum IgG exposure (Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve [AUC]) not inferior to that of the previous IGIV treatment. If the patient has not been previously treated with IV Gammaked, convert the monthly IGIV dose (in grams) by multiplying by 1.37, then dividing this dose into weekly doses based on the patient’s previous IGIV treatment interval. Monitor the patient’s clinical response, and adjust dose accordingly.</p><p><span class="Bold">Initial Weekly Dose<br/></span> To calculate the initial weekly dose of subcutaneous administration of Gammaked, multiply the previous IGIV dose in grams by the dose adjustment factor of 1.37; then divide this by the number of weeks between doses during the patient’s IGIV treatment (i.e., 3 or 4).<br/>
<br/></p><p>          Initial SC dose (in grams) = <span class="Bold">1.37 × previous IGIV dose (in grams) <br/></span>                                                        Number of weeks between IGIV doses</p><p>To convert the Gammaked dose (in grams) to milliliters (mL), multiply the calculated Initial SC dose (in grams) by 10.</p><p><span class="Bold">Dose Adjustment <br/></span> Over time, the dose may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired clinical response and serum IgG trough level. To determine if a dose adjustment may be considered, measure the patient’s serum IgG trough level on IGIV and as early as 5 weeks after switching from IGIV to subcutaneous. The target serum IgG trough level on weekly SC treatment is projected to be the last IGIV trough level plus 340 mg/dL. To determine if further dose adjustments are necessary, monitor the patient’s IgG trough level every 2 to 3 months.</p><p>To adjust the dose based on trough levels, calculate the difference (in mg/dL) of the patient’s serum IgG trough level from the target IgG trough level (the last IGIV trough level + 340 mg/dL). Then find this difference in Table 1 and the corresponding amount (in mL) by which to increase or decrease the weekly dose based on the patient’s body weight. <span class="Bold">However, the patient’s clinical response should be the primary consideration in dose adjustment.</span></p><p>For example, if a patient with a body weight of 70 kg has an actual IgG trough level of 900 mg/dL and the target level is 1,000 mg/dL, this results in a difference of 100 mg/dL. Therefore, increase the weekly dose of subcutaneous dose by 12 mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Monitor the patient’s clinical response, and repeat the dose adjustment as needed.</span></p><p>Dosage requirements for patients switching to Gammaked from another Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (IGSC) product have not been studied. If a patient on Gammaked does not maintain an adequate clinical response or a serum IgG trough level equivalent to that of the previous IGSC treatment, adjust the dose accordingly. For such patients, Table 1 also provides guidance for dose adjustment to achieve a desired IGSC trough level.</p><h3>ITP</h3><p class="First"> <span class="Bold">      DO NOT ADMINISTER SUBCUTANEOUSLY <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span></span></p><p>Gammaked may be administered at a total dose of 2 g/kg, divided in two doses of 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) given on two consecutive days or into five doses of 0.4 g/kg (4 mL/kg) given on five consecutive days. If after administration of the first of two daily 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) doses, an adequate increase in the platelet count is observed at 24 hours, the second dose of 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) body weight may be withheld.</p><p>The high dose regimen (1 g/kg × 1-2 days) is not recommended for individuals with expanded fluid volumes or where fluid volume may be a concern. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Clinical Studies (14)]</span></p><p>The recommended initial infusion rate is 1 mg/kg/min (0.01 mL/kg/min). If the infusion is well-tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/min (0.08 mL/kg/min). For patients judged to be at risk for renal dysfunction or thrombosis, administer Gammaked at the minimum infusion rate practicable. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4)]</span> </p><h3>CIDP</h3><p class="First">Gammaked may be initially administered as a total loading dose of 2 g/kg (20 mL/kg) given in divided doses over two to four consecutive days. Gammaked may be administered as a maintenance infusion of 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg) administered over 1 day or divided into two doses of 0.5 g/kg (5 mL/kg) given on two consecutive days, every 3 weeks. Not all patients may require continued maintenance therapy beyond the initial 6 months of therapy in order to maintain their therapeutic response.</p><p>The recommended initial infusion rate is 2 mg/kg/min (0.02 mL/kg/min). If the infusion is well tolerated, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/min (0.08 mL/kg/min). For patients judged to be at risk for renal dysfunction or thrombosis, administer Gammaked at the minimum infusion rate practicable. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4)]</span></p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Administer intravenously for PI, ITP and CIDP.</span></p><p>Gammaked may also be administered subcutaneously for the treatment of PI.</p><ul>

Slow or stop infusion if adverse reactions occur. If symptoms subside promptly, the infusion may be resumed at a lower rate that is comfortable for the patient.</p><p>Certain severe adverse drug reactions may be related to the rate of infusion. Slowing or stopping the infusion usually allows the symptoms to disappear promptly.</p><p>Ensure that patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency are not volume depleted. For patients at risk of renal dysfunction or thrombosis, administer Gammaked at the minimum infusion rate practicable and discontinue Gammaked if renal function deteriorates.</p><p><span class="Bold">Subcutaneous for PI Only</span></p><p><span class="Bold">For PI</span>, it is recommended that Gammaked is infused at a rate of 20 mL per hour per infusion site for adults, and up to 8 infusion sites may be used (most patients used 4 infusion sites). Children and adolescents weighing ≥ 25 kg should start out at a slower infusion rate of 15 mL/hour/infusion site and increase their infusion rate up to 20 mL/hour/infusion site. For children and adolescents weighing &lt; 25 kg, a rate of 10 mL/hour/infusion site is recommended. In children up to 6 infusion sites simultaneously may be used. For patients of all ages ensure that the infusion sites are at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Gammaked is a sterile solution for injection supplied in 1 g protein (10 mL), 2.5 g protein (25 mL), 5 g protein (50 mL), 10 g protein (100 mL), or 20 g protein (200 mL) single use vials.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions to Immune Globulins</h3><p class="First">Gammaked is contraindicated in patients who have had an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to the administration of human immune globulin.</p><h3>IgA Sensitive Patients with History of Hypersensitivity Reaction</h3><p class="First">Gammaked is contraindicated in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and history of hypersensitivity.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur with IGIV products, including Gammaked. In case of hypersensitivity, discontinue Gammaked infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment. Have medications such as epinephrine available for immediate treatment of acute hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p>Gammaked contains trace amounts of IgA (average 46 micrograms/mL). Patients with known antibodies to IgA may have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. It is contraindicated in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and history of hypersensitivity reaction. <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span></p><h3>Renal Failure</h3><p class="First">Acute renal dysfunction/failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy, osmotic nephrosis and death may occur upon use of IGIV products, especially those containing sucrose.(7,8) Gammaked does not contain sucrose. Ensure that patients are not volume depleted prior to the initiation of the infusion of Gammaked. Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential increased risk for developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/serum creatinine, prior to the initial infusion of Gammaked and again at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function deteriorates, consider discontinuation of Gammaked. <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]  </span>For patients judged to be at risk for developing renal dysfunction, including patients with any degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs, administer Gammaked at the minimum infusion rate practicable [less than 8 mg/kg/min (0.08 mL/kg/min)]. <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span></p><h3>Hyperproteinemia, Increased Serum Viscosity, and Hyponatremia</h3><p class="First">Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV treatment, including Gammaked. It is clinically critical to distinguish true hyponatremia from a pseudohyponatremia that is associated with concomitant decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap, because treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion, a further increase in serum viscosity and a possible predisposition to thrombosis.(9)</p><h3>Thrombosis</h3><p class="First">Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immune globulin products, including Gammaked.(10-12) Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors.</p><p>Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer Gammaked at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.5), Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span></p><h3>Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)</h3><p class="First">AMS may occur infrequently with IGIV treatment, including Gammaked. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.  The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment. AMS is characterized by the following symptoms and signs:  severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cu mm, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and with elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. AMS may occur more frequently in association with high doses (2 g/kg) and/or rapid infusion of IGIV.</p><h3>Hemolysis</h3><p class="First">Gammaked may contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBCs) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and hemolysis.(13-16) Delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration, and acute hemolysis consistent with intravascular hemolysis, has been reported. <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span></p><p>The following risk factors may be related to the development of hemolysis: high doses (e.g., ≥ 2 grams/kg, single administration or divided over several days) and non-O blood group.(17) Underlying inflammatory state in an individual patient may increase the risk of hemolysis, but its role is uncertain.(18)</p><p>Closely monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span>, particularly patients with risk factors noted above and those with pre-existing anemia and/or cardiovascular or pulmonary compromise. Consider appropriate laboratory testing in higher risk patients, including measurement of hemoglobin or hematocrit prior to infusion and within approximately 36 hours and again 7 to 10 days post infusion. If clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis or a significant drop in hemoglobin or hematocrit have been observed, perform additional confirmatory laboratory testing. If transfusion is indicated for patients who develop hemolysis with clinically compromising anemia after receiving IGIV, perform adequate cross-matching to avoid exacerbating on-going hemolysis.</p><h3>Transfusion-related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)</h3><p class="First">Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following treatment with IGIV products, including Gammaked.(19) TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically occur within 1 to 6 hours after treatment.</p><p>Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span> If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and patient serum. TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.</p><h3>Volume Overload</h3><p class="First">The high dose regimen (1g/kg x 1-2 days) is not recommended for individuals with expanded fluid volumes or where fluid volume may be a concern.</p><h3>Transmission of Infectious Agents</h3><p class="First">Because Gammaked is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. No cases of transmission of viral diseases, vCJD or CJD have ever been identified for Gammaked. ALL infections suspected by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Grifols Therapeutics LLC [1-800-520-2807].</p><h3>Hematoma Formation</h3><p class="First">Do not administer Gammaked subcutaneously in patients with ITP because of the risk of hematoma formation.</p><h3>Monitoring: Laboratory Tests</h3><ul>
<li>Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of BUN and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of Gammaked and at appropriate intervals thereafter.</li>
<li>Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies, because of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis.</li>
<li>If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after an infusion of Gammaked, perform appropriate laboratory testing for confirmation.</li>
<li>If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and patient’s serum.</li>
</ul><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">After infusion of IgG, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient’s blood may yield positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g., A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) test.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">PI: Intravenous: The most common adverse reactions observed at a rate ≥ 5% in subjects with intravenous treatment in the clinical trials were cough increased, rhinitis, pharyngitis, headache, asthma, nausea, fever, diarrhea, and sinusitis.</p><p>PI: Subcutaneous: The most common adverse reactions observed at a rate ≥ 5% of subjects with subcutaneous treatment in the clinical trials were local infusion site reactions, fatigue, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, diarrhea, nausea, sinusitis, bronchitis, depression, allergic dermatitis, erythema, migraine, myalgia, viral infection, and pyrexia.</p><p>ITP: The most common adverse reactions observed at a rate ≥ 5% in subjects in the clinical trials were headache, ecchymosis, vomiting, fever, nausea, rash, abdominal pain, back pain and dyspepsia.</p><p>CIDP: The most common adverse reactions observed at a rate ≥ 5% in subjects in the clinical trial were headache, pyrexia, hypertension, chills, rash, nausea, arthralgia, and asthenia.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of one drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">PI: Intravenous Administration</span></span></p><p>The most serious adverse event observed in clinical study subjects receiving Gammaked IV for PI was an exacerbation of autoimmune pure red cell aplasia in one subject.</p><p>In four different clinical trials to study PI, out of 157 subjects treated with Gammaked, 4 subjects discontinued due to the following adverse events: Coombs negative hypochromic anemia, autoimmune pure red cell aplasia, arthralgia/hyperhidrosis/fatigue/myalgia/nausea and migraine.</p><p>In a study of 87 subjects, 9 subjects in each treatment group were pretreated with non-steroidal medication prior to infusion, such as diphenhydramine and acetaminophen.</p><p>Table 2 lists the adverse reactions reported by at least 5% of subjects during the 9-month treatment.</p><p>Table 3 lists the frequency of adverse reactions (as defined for Table 2), which were reported by at least 5% of subjects.</p><p>The mean number of adverse reactions per infusion that occurred during or within 72 hours of the end of product infusion was 0.33 for the Gammaked and 0.39 for the GAMIMUNE<span class="Sup">®</span> N, 10% [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10%] treatment group.</p><p>In all three trials in primary humoral immunodeficiencies, the maximum infusion rate was 0.08 mL/kg/min (8 mg/kg/min). The infusion rate was reduced for 11 of 222 exposed subjects (7 Gammaked, 4 GAMIMUNE N, 10%) at 17 occasions. In most instances, mild to moderate hives/urticaria, itching, pain or reaction at infusion site, anxiety or headache was the main reason. There was one case of severe chills. There were no anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions to Gammaked or GAMIMUNE N, 10% in clinical trials.</p><p>In the IV efficacy and safety study, serum samples were drawn to monitor the virus safety at baseline and one week after the first infusion of IGIV (for parvovirus B19), eight weeks after first and fifth infusion of IGIV (for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV-1), 16 weeks after the first and fifth infusion of IGIV (for hepatitis C) and at any time of premature discontinuation of the study (for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV-1, and parvovirus B19). Viral markers of hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV-1, and parvovirus B19 were monitored by nucleic acid testing (NAT, Polymerase Chain Reaction [PCR]) and serological testing.  There were no treatment related emergent findings of virus transmission for either Gammaked or GAMIMUNE N, 10%.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">PI: Subcutaneous Administration (PK and Safety Studies)</span></span></p><p>Adverse reactions were divided into 2 types: 1) Local infusion site reactions, and 2) Non-infusion site adverse reactions. Table 4 lists those adverse reactions (as defined for Table 2) occurring in ≥ 2% of infusions during the SC phase of two pharmacokinetic (PK) crossover and safety trials, one in adults and adolescents and the other in children and adolescents. <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span></p><p>Table 5 lists the adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects and the frequency of adverse reactions (as defined for Table 2) per infusion.</p><p>There were no serious bacterial infections in the SC phase of the PK and safety trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Local Infusion Site Reactions</span></p><p>Local infusion site reactions with SC Gammaked consisted of erythema, pain and swelling. One child discontinued due to infusion site pain. The majority of local infusion site reactions resolved within 3 days. The number of subjects experiencing an infusion site reaction and the number of infusion site reactions decreased over time as subjects received continued weekly SC infusions. At the beginning of the SC phase (week 1) in the adult and adolescent trial, a rate of approximately 1 infusion site reaction per infusion was reported, whereas at the end of the study (week 24) this rate was reduced to 0.5 infusion site reactions per infusion, a reduction of 50%. In the children and adolescent trial, the rate of local infusion site reactions decreased from week 1 for all age groups by the end of the study.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">ITP</span></span></p><p>In two different clinical trials to study ITP, out of 76 subjects treated with Gammaked, 2 subjects discontinued due to the following adverse reactions: Hives and Headache/Fever/Vomiting.</p><p>One subject, a 10-year-old boy, died suddenly from myocarditis 50 days after his second infusion of Gammaked.

Clinical studies of Gammaked did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">With intravenous administration, overdose of Gammaked may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity. Patients at risk of complications of fluid overload and hyperviscosity include elderly patients and those with cardiac renal impairment.</p><h2>Gammaked Description</h2><p class="First">Gammaked is a ready-to-use sterile, non-pyrogenic solution of human immune globulin protein for intravenous and subcutaneous (PI indication only) administration. Gammaked is clear to opalescent, and colorless to pale yellow. Gammaked consists of 9%–11% protein in 0.16–0.24 M glycine. Not less than 98% of the protein has the electrophoretic mobility of gamma globulin. The main component of Gammaked is IgG (≥ 98%) with a sub-class distribution of IgG<span class="Sub">1</span>, IgG<span class="Sub">2</span>, IgG<span class="Sub">3</span> and IgG<span class="Sub">4</span> of approximately 62.8%, 29.7%, 4.8% and 2.7% respectively. The distribution of IgG subclasses is similar to that found in normal serum.</p><p>Gammaked contains trace levels of fragments, IgA (average 0.046 mg/mL), and IgM. Gammaked doses of 1 g/kg correspond to a glycine dose of 0.15 g/kg. While toxic effects of glycine administration have been reported, the doses and rates of administration were 3–4 fold greater than those for Gammaked. In another study it was demonstrated that intravenous bolus doses of 0.44 g/kg glycine were not associated with serious adverse effects.(21) Caprylate is a saturated medium-chain (C8) fatty acid of plant origin. Medium chain fatty acids are considered to be essentially non-toxic. Human subjects receiving medium chain fatty acids parenterally have tolerated doses of 3.0 to 9.0 g/kg/day for periods of several months without adverse effects.(22) Residual caprylate concentrations in the final container are no more than 0.216 g/L (1.3 mmol/L). The measured buffer capacity is 35 mEq/L (0.35 mEq/g protein) and the osmolality is 258 mOsmol/kg solvent, which is close to physiological osmolality (285-295 mOsmol/kg). A dose of 1 g/kg body weight therefore represents an acid load of 0.35 mEq/kg body weight. The total buffering capacity of whole blood in a normal individual is 45–50 mEq/L of blood, or 3.6 mEq/kg body weight. Thus, the acid load delivered with a dose of 1 g/kg of Gammaked would be neutralized by the buffering capacity of whole blood alone, even if the dose was infused instantaneously. The pH of Gammaked is 4.0–4.5. Gammaked contains no preservative. Gammaked is not made with natural rubber latex.</p><p>Gammaked is made from large pools of human plasma by a combination of cold ethanol fractionation, caprylate precipitation and filtration, and anion-exchange chromatography. Isotonicity is achieved by the addition of glycine. Gammaked is incubated in the final container (at the low pH of 4.0–4.3). The product is intended for intravenous administration and may be administered subcutaneously in treatment of PI.</p><p>The capacity of the manufacturing process to remove and/or inactivate enveloped and non-enveloped viruses has been validated by laboratory spiking studies on a scaled down process model, using the following enveloped and non-enveloped viruses: human immunodeficiency virus, type I (HIV-1) as the relevant virus for HIV-1 and HIV–2; bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) as a model for hepatitis C virus; pseudorabies virus (PRV) as a model for large enveloped DNA viruses (e.g., herpes viruses); Reovirus type 3 (Reo) as a model for non-enveloped viruses and for its resistance to physical and chemical inactivation; hepatitis A virus (HAV) as relevant non-enveloped virus, and porcine parvovirus (PPV) as a model for human parvovirus B19.(23)</p><p>Overall virus reduction was calculated only from steps that were mechanistically independent from each other and truly additive. In addition, each step was verified to provide robust virus reduction across the production range for key operating parameters.</p><p>Additionally, the manufacturing process was investigated for its capacity to decrease the infectivity of an experimental agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), considered as a model for the vCJD and CJD agents.(23)</p><p>Several of the individual production steps in the Gammaked manufacturing process have been shown to decrease TSE infectivity of that experimental model agent. TSE reduction steps include two depth filtrations (in sequence, a total of ≥ 6.6 log<span class="Sub">10</span>).  These studies provide reasonable assurance that low levels of CJD/vCJD agent infectivity, if present in the starting material, would be removed.</p><h2>Gammaked - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">PI</span></span></p><p>Gammaked supplies a broad spectrum of opsonic and neutralizing IgG antibodies against bacterial, viral, parasitic, and mycoplasmal agents, and their toxins.

In the first study, a single sequence, open-label, crossover trial in adults and adolescents, the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of SC administered Gammaked in subjects with PI were evaluated.(24) A total of 32 and 26 subjects received Gammaked as IV or SC for PK study, respectively, of whom 3 were adolescents.  Subjects received Gammaked 200-600 mg/kg IV every 3-4 weeks for at least 3 months, at which time they entered the IV phase of the study. Subjects were crossed over to weekly SC infusions. The weekly SC dose was determined by multiplying the total IV dose by 1.37 and dividing the resultant new total dose by 3 or 4 depending on the previous IV interval.</p><p>In the second study, a single sequence, open-label, crossover trial, the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of SC administered Gammaked were evaluated in children and adolescents.  The design of the study was essentially the same as above. A total of 11 subjects received Gammaked as IV and 10 received Gammaked as SC for PK analysis. Age groups were as follows: age 2 to 5 years, [N = 1 both phases]; 6 to 11 years, [N = 5 completing IV phase, N = 4 evaluated in SC phase]; 12-16 years: [N = 5 both phases].</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Intravenous Administration</span></span></p><p>The pharmacokinetic parameters of Gammaked, measured as total IgG for intravenous administration are shown in Table 10.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">PI: Subcutaneous Administration</span></span></p><p>The PK parameter (AUC of total IgG) following IV and SC administration is summarized in Table 11 for subcutaneous vs intravenous administration in the two pharmacokinetic trials. In the adult and adolescent trial, the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean ratio of AUC (SC vs. IV) was 0.861, therefore, meeting the pre-specified non-inferiority margin between the two modes of administration. The PK analysis results in children and adolescents are consistent to those in the adult and adolescent trial, demonstrating the appropriateness of the conversion factor of 1.37 applied to calculating the SC dose from the IV dose of Gammaked in pediatric populations.</p><p class="First">AUC<span class="Sub">0-τ,IV</span><br/>

Twenty-four percent of the subjects were less than or equal to 16 years of age.(26)</p><p>Gammaked was demonstrated to be at least as effective as GAMIMUNE N, 10% in the treatment of adults and children with acute or chronic ITP.</p><p>A trial was conducted to evaluate the clinical response to rapid infusion of Gammaked in patients with ITP. The study involved 28 chronic ITP subjects, wherein the subjects received 1 g/kg Gammaked on three occasions for treatment of relapses. The infusion rate was randomly assigned to 0.08, 0.11, or 0.14 mL/kg/min (8, 11 or 14 mg/kg/min). Pre-medication with corticosteroids to alleviate infusion-related intolerability was not permitted. Pre-treatment with antihistamines, anti-pyretics and analgesics was permitted.  The average dose was approximately 1 g/kg body weight at all three prescribed rates of infusion (0.08, 0.11 and 0.14 mL/kg/min).  All patients were administered each of the three planned infusions except seven subjects. Based on 21 patients per treatment group, the a posteriori power to detect twice as many drug-related adverse events between groups was 23%. Of the seven subjects that did not complete the study, five did not require additional treatment, one withdrew because he refused to participate without concomitant medication (prednisone) and one experienced an adverse event (hives); however, this was at the lowest dose rate level (0.08 mL/kg/min).</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">CIDP</span></span></p><p>A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, Placebo-controlled trial (The Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% Caprylate/Chromatography Purified CIDP Efficacy or ICE study) was conducted with Gammaked.(27) This study included two separately randomized periods to assess whether Gammaked was more effective than Placebo for the treatment of CIDP (assessed in the Efficacy Period for up to 24 weeks) and whether long-term administration of Gammaked could maintain long-term benefit (assessed in the 24 week Randomized Withdrawal Period).</p><p>In the Efficacy Period, there was a requirement for Rescue (crossover) to the alternate study drug if the subject did not improve and maintain this improvement until the end of the 24 week treatment period. Subjects entering the Rescue phase followed the same dosing and schedule as in the Efficacy period. Any subject who was rescued (crossed over) and did not improve and maintain this improvement was withdrawn from the study.</p><p>Subjects who completed 24 weeks treatment in the Efficacy period or Rescue phase and responded to therapy were eligible for entry into a double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period. Eligible subjects were re-randomized to Gammaked or Placebo. Any subject who relapsed was withdrawn from the study.</p><p>The Efficacy Period and the Rescue treatment started with a loading dose of 2 g/kg body weight of Gammaked or equal volume of Placebo given over 2-4 consecutive days. All other infusions (including the first infusion of the Randomized Withdrawal Period) were given as maintenance doses of 1 g/kg body weight (or equivalent volume of Placebo) every three weeks.</p><p>The Responder rates of the Gammaked and Placebo treatment groups were measured by the INCAT score. The INCAT (Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment) scale is used to assess functional disability of both upper and lower extremities in demyelinating polyneuropathy. The INCAT scale has upper and lower extremity components (maximum of 5 points for upper (arm disability) and maximum of 5 points for lower (leg disability)) that add up to a maximum of 10-points (0 is normal and 10 is severely incapacitated).(28) At the start of the efficacy portion of the study, the INCAT scores were as follows: Upper Extremity mean was 2.2 ± 1.0, and median was 2.0 with a range of 0 to 5; Lower Extremity mean was 1.9 ± 0.9, and median was 2.0 with a range of 1 to 5; Total Overall Score mean was 4.2 ± 1.4, and median was 4.0 with a range of 2 to 9. A Responder was defined as a subject with at least 1-point improvement from baseline in the adjusted INCAT score that was maintained through 24 weeks.</p><p>More subjects with CIDP responded to Gammaked: 28 of 59 subjects (47.5%) responded to Gammaked compared with 13 of 58 subjects (22.4%) administered Placebo (25% difference; 95% CI 7%-43%; <span class="Bold">p=0.006</span>). The study included both subjects who were IGIV naïve and subjects who had previous IGIV experience.  The outcome was influenced by the group of subjects who experienced prior therapy with IGIV, as shown by the outcomes table, below.</p><p>Time to relapse for the subset of 57 subjects who previously responded to Gammaked was evaluated: 31 were randomly reassigned to continue to receive Gammaked and 26 subjects were randomly reassigned to Placebo in the Randomized Withdrawal Period. Subjects who continued to receive Gammaked experienced a longer time to relapse versus subjects treated with Placebo (<span class="Bold">p=0.011</span>).

Please read this information about Gammaked carefully before using this medicine. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare professional, and it does not include all of the important information about Gammaked. If you have any questions after reading this, contact your healthcare professional.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about Gammaked?<br/></span><br/>
Gammaked should be infused under your skin (in the subcutaneous tissue). DO NOT inject Gammaked into a blood vessel or directly into a muscle.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is Gammaked?<br/>
<br/></span> Gammaked (găm´-ə-kĕd) is an immunoglobulin used to treat primary immune deficiency (PI). Immunoglobulin is another name for the purified antibodies from human plasma that defend the body against infections such as viruses and bacteria. People with PI lack the healthy antibodies needed to fight off these infections. Gammaked provides those healthy antibodies and will help lower the number and severity of infections you could get.</p><p><span class="Bold">Who should <span class="Bold">NOT</span> take Gammaked?<br/></span><br/>
Do not take Gammaked if you have known severe allergic reactions or a severe response to Immune Globulin (Human). Tell your doctor if you have had a serious reaction to other medicines that contain immune globulin. Also tell your doctor if you have an immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency.</p><p><span class="Bold">How should I take Gammaked?<br/></span> <br/>
You will take Gammaked through infusions given just below the skin (in the subcutaneous tissue). As directed by your physician, one or more injection sites on your body will be selected. The number and location of the injection sites depends on the amount you need to receive. Typically, adults may use 1 to 4 needles in different locations at one time. You may use up to 8 needles as directed by your doctor. For children, use up to 6 infusion sites simultaneously. For patients of all ages ensure that the infusion sites are at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart. The needles are attached with a tube to the pump. You will need to have infusions once a week.</p><p>Instructions for administering Gammaked are at the end of this patient Instructions for Use <span class="Italics">[see "Steps for Administration"].</span> Only use Gammaked by yourself after you have been instructed by your doctor or healthcare professional.</p><p><span class="Bold">What should I avoid while taking Gammaked?<br/></span><br/>
Certain types of vaccines (ones containing a live virus) may not work as well for you if you are also receiving immunoglobulin products like Gammaked. The antibodies in Gammaked may prevent the vaccine from working. Before you get a vaccine, tell the doctor or nurse that you are taking Gammaked.</p><p>Tell your doctor or healthcare professional if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or if you are nursing.</p><p><span class="Bold">What are possible side effects of Gammaked?<br/></span><br/>
The most common side effects with Gammaked when given under the skin (subcutaneously) are:</p><ul>
<li>Redness, swelling, and itching at the injection site</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Pain (including pain in the joints, arms, legs)</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Migraine</li>
<li>Fever</li>
</ul><p>Tell your doctor right away or go to the emergency room if you have hives, trouble breathing, wheezing, dizziness, or fainting.

</ul><p>Tell your doctor about any side effects that concern you. You can ask your doctor to give you the full prescribing information available to healthcare professionals.</p><p><span class="Bold">Steps for Administration<br/></span> Infuse Gammaked only after you have been trained by your doctor or healthcare professional. Below are step-by-step instructions to help you remember how to use Gammaked. Ask your doctor or healthcare professional about any instructions you do not understand.</p><p><span class="Bold">Before Using Gammaked</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Gammaked comes in single-use vials. </li>
<li>Keep it refrigerated. <span class="Bold">Do not let it freeze.</span></li>
<li>Keep the vial in the carton to protect from light.</li>
<li>Gammaked can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 months but you must use it within that time or you must throw it away.<br/></li>
<li>Do not shake the vials.</li>
<li>Prior to use, allow the solution to come to room temperature (68-77°F or 20-25°C). This can take 60 minutes or longer.</li>
<li>Do not use the vial if:
<ul class="Disc">
<li>the solution is cloudy, discolored or contains particles. The solution should be clear to opalescent, and colorless to pale yellow.</li>
<li>the protective cap or plastic shrink band around the cap is missing, or there is any evidence of tampering. Tell your healthcare provider immediately.</li>
<li>the expiration date has passed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sanitize your infusion set-up area by preparing a clean, flat, non-porous surface such as a kitchen counter. Avoid using porous surfaces such as wood. Clean the surface with an alcohol wipe using a circular motion from the center outward.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>the solution is cloudy, discolored or contains particles. The solution should be clear to opalescent, and colorless to pale yellow.</li>
<li>the protective cap or plastic shrink band around the cap is missing, or there is any evidence of tampering. Tell your healthcare provider immediately.</li>
<li>the expiration date has passed.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Step 1:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before administering Gammaked</span></p><ul>
<li>Your healthcare provider may recommend that you use antibacterial soap or that you wear gloves.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><span class="Bold">Step 2:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Remove the protective cap and sanitize the stopper</span> </p><ul>
<li>Remove the protective cap from the vial to expose the central portion of the stopper.</li>
<li>Wipe the stopper with alcohol and allow to dry.</li>
</ul><p>  </p><p><span class="Bold">Step 3:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Use aseptic technique when preparing and administering Gammaked</span></p><ul>
<li>Do not allow your fingers or other objects to touch the inner stem of the plunger, the syringe tip, or other areas that will come in contact with your Gammaked solution. This is called aseptic technique and is designed to prevent transmission of germs.</li>
<li>Using aseptic technique, attach each needle to the syringe tip.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><span class="Bold">Step 4:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Prepare the syringe and draw Gammaked solution into syringe</span></p><ul>
<li>Remove cap from needle.</li>
<li>Pull the syringe plunger back to the level matching the amount of Gammaked to be withdrawn from the vial.</li>
<li>Place the Gammaked vial on a clean flat surface and insert the needle into the center of the vial stopper.</li>
<li>Inject air into the vial. The amount of air should match the amount of Gammaked to be withdrawn.</li>
<li>Turn the vial upside down and withdraw the correct amount of Gammaked. If multiple vials are required to achieve the correct dose, repeat Step 4.</li>
</ul><p></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 5:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Fill the pump reservoir and prepare the infusion pump</span></p><ul>
<li>Follow the pump manufacturer’s instructions for filling the pump reservoir and preparing the infusion pump, administration tubing and Y-site connection tubing, if needed.</li>
<li>Be sure to prime the administration tubing to ensure that no air is left in the tubing or needle by filling the tubing/needle with Gammaked. To prime, hold the syringe in one hand and the administration tubing’s capped needle in the other. Gently squeeze on the plunger until you see a drop of Gammaked exit from the needle.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Example Equipment</span></p><p></p><p><span class="Bold">Step 6:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Select the number and location of infusion sites</span></p><ul>
<li>Select one or more infusion sites as directed by your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>The number and location of injection sites depends on the volume of the total dose.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><span class="Bold">Step 7:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Prepare the infusion site</span></p><ul>
<li>Cleanse the infusion site(s) with antiseptic solution using a circular motion working from the center of the site and moving to the outside.</li>
<li>Sites should be clean, dry, and at least 2 inches apart.</li>
</ul><p>  </p><p><span class="Bold">Step 8:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Insert the needle</span></p><ul>
<li>Grasp the skin between two fingers and insert the needle into the subcutaneous tissue.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><span class="Bold">Step 9:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Do not inject Gammaked into a blood vessel</span></p><ul>
<li>After inserting each needle into tissue (and before your infusion), make sure that a blood vessel has not been accidentally entered. To do this, attach a sterile syringe to the end of the primed administration tubing. Pull back on the syringe plunger and watch for any blood flowing back into administration tubing.</li>
<li>If you see any blood, remove and discard the needle and administration tubing.</li>
</ul><p> </p><ul>
<li>Repeat priming and needle insertion steps using a new needle, administration tubing and a new infusion site.</li>
<li>Secure the needle in place by applying sterile gauze or transparent dressing over the site.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><span class="Bold">Step 10:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Repeat for other sites, as needed</span></p><ul>
<li>If using multiple, simultaneous infusion sites, use Y-site connection tubing and secure to the administration tubing.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Step 11:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Infuse Gammaked following the pump manufacturer’s instructions for the infusion pump</span></p><p> </p><p><span class="Bold">Step 12:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">After infusion, turn off pump and dispose of used supplies</span></p><ul>
<li>Follow manufacturer’s instructions to turn off pump.</li>
<li>Undo and discard any dressing or tape.</li>
<li>Gently remove the inserted needle(s) or catheter(s).</li>
<li>Discard any unused solution in an appropriate waste container as instructed.</li>
<li>Discard any used administration equipment in an appropriate waste container.</li>
<li>Store your supplies in a safe place.</li>
<li>Follow manufacturer's instructions to care for the infusion pump.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">Step 13:<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Record each infusion</span></p><ul>
<li>Remove the peel-off label with the product lot number from the Gammaked vial and use this to complete the patient record.</li>
<li>Remember to bring your journal with you when you visit your physician or healthcare provider.</li>
</ul><p>Be sure to tell your doctor about any problems you have doing your infusions. Your doctor may ask to see your journal, so be sure to take it with you each time you visit the doctor’s office.</p><p>Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You can also report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><p>Distributed by:<br/>
