This medication helps your pancreas produce insulin more efficiently. Byetta is a short-acting form of exenatide.</p><p>Byetta is used together with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Byetta is not for treating type 1 diabetes.</p><p>This medication guide provides information about the Byetta, an immediate-release brand of exenatide. Bydureon is an extended-release brand of exenatide that is not covered in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Byetta if you have severe kidney disease (or you are on dialysis), or if you have slowed digestion or diabetic ketoacidosis.</p><p>You should not use this medicine if Byetta has ever caused you to have low platelet levels in your blood.</p><p>Stop using this medicine and call your doctor at once if you have nausea and vomiting with severe pain in your upper stomach spreading to your back.</p><p>You should not use Byetta together with fast-acting or short-acting insulins.

Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.</p><p>Byetta is injected under the skin. A healthcare provider may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand all instructions.</p><p>Prepare your injection only when you are ready to give it. You must give the injection right away after mixing.</p><p>Byetta is usually injected twice a day, before the morning and evening meals. Do not use after eating a meal. You must use Byetta within 60 minutes (1 hour) before eating. Your injections should be given at least 6 hours apart.</p><p>You may have low blood sugar <b>(hypoglycemia)</b> and feel very hungry, dizzy, irritable, confused, anxious, or shaky. To quickly treat hypoglycemia, eat or drink a fast-acting source of sugar (fruit juice, hard candy, crackers, raisins, or non-diet soda).</p><p>Your doctor may prescribe a glucagon injection kit in case you have severe hypoglycemia. Be sure your family or close friends know how to give you this injection in an emergency.</p><p>Also watch for signs of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) such as increased thirst or urination.</p><p>Blood sugar levels can be affected by stress, illness, surgery, exercise, alcohol use, or skipping meals. <b>Ask your doctor before changing your dose or medication schedule.</b></p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Never share an injection pen or syringe with another person, even if the needle has been changed. Sharing these devices can allow infections or disease to pass from one person to another.</p><p>Exenatide can lower your platelet counts for up to 10 weeks after you stop using Byetta. You may need frequent medical tests while using this medicine and for a short time after you stop.</p><p>Byetta is only part of a complete treatment program that may also include diet, exercise, weight control, regular blood sugar testing, and special medical care. Follow your doctor's instructions very closely.</p><p><b>Storing unopened (not in use) pens:</b> Keep the medicine in its original container. Refrigerate and use until expiration date.
