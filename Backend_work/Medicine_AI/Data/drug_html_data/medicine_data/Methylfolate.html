Folate is necessary for formation of numerous coenzymes in many metabolic systems, particularly for purine, pyrimidine, and nucleoprotein synthesis, and maintenance in erythropoiesis; stimulates WBC and platelet production in folate deficiency anemia. </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p>Medical food for the nutritional requirements of patients with suboptimal L-methylfolate and who have major depressive disorder or schizophrenia</p><p><b>Note:</b> A medical food is formulated to be administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements are established by medical evaluation.
