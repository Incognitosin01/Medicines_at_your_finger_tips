Hypertension and nephrotoxicity can occur at recommended dosages, and the risk increases with increasing dose and duration of cycloSPORINE therapy.

It belongs to a group of medicines known as immunosuppressive agents.</p><p>When a patient receives an organ transplant, the body's white blood cells will try to get rid of (reject) the transplanted organ. Cyclosporine works by suppressing the immune system to prevent the white blood cells from trying to get rid of the transplanted organ.</p><p>Cyclosporine is also used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed treatment with methotrexate. This medicine is also used to treat adults with severe plaque psoriasis after other treatments (eg, PUVA, retinoids, methotrexate) failed.</p><p>Cyclosporine is a very strong medicine. It can cause side effects that can be very serious, such as kidney problems. It may also decrease the body's ability to fight infections. <i>You and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it</i>.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Neoral</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

However, no pediatric-specific problems have been documented to date.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of cyclosporine in children with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of cyclosporine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have high blood pressure or age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving cyclosporine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.

In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella.

Check with your medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums.</p><p>This medicine may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and can increase your risk of having skin cancer.
