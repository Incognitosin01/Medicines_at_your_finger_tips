</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before Using Vaccinia</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (human), the following should be considered:</p><p><strong>Allergies:</strong> Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (human) or other human immunoglobulins.
