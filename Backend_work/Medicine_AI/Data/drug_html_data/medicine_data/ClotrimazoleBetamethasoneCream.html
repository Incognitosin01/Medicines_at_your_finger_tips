</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Clotrimazole Betamethasone Cream</h2><p class="First">Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream is a combination of an azole antifungal and corticosteroid and is indicated for the topical treatment of symptomatic inflammatory tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis due to <span class="Italics">Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes,</span> and <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum</span> in patients 17 years and older.</p><h2>Clotrimazole Betamethasone Cream Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Treatment of tinea corporis or tinea cruris:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Apply a thin film of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream into the affected skin areas twice a day for one week.</li>
<li>Do not use more than 45 grams per week. Do not use with occlusive dressings.</li>
<li>If a patient shows no clinical improvement after 1 week of treatment with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream, the diagnosis should be reviewed.</li>
<li>Do not use longer than 2 weeks.</li>
</ul><p>Treatment of tinea pedis:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>Gently massage a sufficient amount of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream into the affected skin areas twice a day for two weeks.</li>
<li>Do not use more than 45 grams per week. Do not use with occlusive dressings.</li>
<li>If a patient shows no clinical improvement after 2 weeks of treatment with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream, the diagnosis should be reviewed.</li>
<li>Do not use longer than 4 weeks.</li>
</ul><p>Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream is for topical use only. It is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><p>Avoid contact with eyes. Wash hands after each application.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Cream, 1%/0.05% (base). Each gram of Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream USP contains<br/>
10 mg of clotrimazole, USP and 0.64 mg of betamethasone dipropionate, USP (equivalent to 0.5 mg of betamethasone) in a white to off-white hydrophilic cream.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Effects on Endocrine System</h3><p class="First">Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Cushingâ€™s syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effect of corticosteroids while on treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressing, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.</p><p>Because of the potential for systemic corticosteroid effects, patients may need to be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test.</p><p>In a small trial, clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied using large dosages, 7 g daily for 14 days (BID) to the crural area of normal adult subjects. Three of the 8 normal subjects on whom clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied exhibited low morning plasma cortisol levels during treatment. One of these subjects had an abnormal cosyntropin test. The effect on morning plasma cortisol was transient and subjects recovered 1 week after discontinuing dosing. In addition, 2 separate trials in pediatric subjects demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p>If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.</p><p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin-surface-to-body mass ratios <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>Diaper Dermatitis</h3><p class="First">The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the treatment of diaper dermatitis is not recommended.</p><h3>Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products, including topical betamethasone products <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Avoid contact of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In clinical trials common adverse reaction reported for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was paresthesia in 1.9% of patients. Adverse reactions reported at a frequency less than 1% included rash, edema, and secondary infection.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids: itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, skin atrophy, striae, miliaria, capillary fragility (ecchymoses), telangiectasia, and sensitization (local reactions upon repeated application of product).</p><p>Ophthalmic adverse reactions of blurred vision, cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and central serous chorioretinopathy have been reported with the use of topical corticosteroids, including topical betamethasone products.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported with the use of clotrimazole are: erythema, stinging, blistering, peeling, edema, pruritus, urticaria, and general irritation of the skin.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on topical betamethasone dipropionate or clotrimazole use in pregnant women to identify a clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.</p><p>Observational studies suggest an increased risk of low birthweight infants with the use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroid during pregnancy<span class="Italics">.</span> Advise pregnant women that clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream may increase the risk of having a low birthweight infant and to use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible.</p><p>There have been no reproduction studies performed in animals or humans with the combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate. In an animal reproduction study, betamethasone dipropionate caused malformations (i.e., umbilical hernias, cephalocele, and cleft palate) in pregnant rabbits when given by the intramuscular route during organogenesis <span class="Italics">[see Data].</span> The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of clotrimazole and/or betamethasone dipropionate observed in the animal studies to the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Clotrimazole</p><p>Studies in pregnant rats treated during organogenesis with intravaginal doses up to 100 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of fetotoxicity due to clotrimazole exposure.</p><p>No increase in fetal malformations was noted in pregnant rats receiving oral (gastric tube) clotrimazole doses up to 100 mg/kg/day during gestation Days 6 to 15. However, clotrimazole dosed at 100 mg/kg/day was embryotoxic (increased resorptions), fetotoxic (reduced fetal weights), and maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) to rats. Clotrimazole dosed at 200 mg/kg/day was maternally lethal, and therefore, fetuses were not evaluated in this group. Also in this study, doses up to 50 mg/kg/day had no adverse effects on dams or fetuses. However, in the combined fertility, embryofetal development, and postnatal development study conducted in rats, 50 mg/kg/day clotrimazole was associated with reduced maternal weight gain and reduced numbers of offspring reared to 4 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><p>Oral clotrimazole doses of 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day did not cause malformations in pregnant mice. No evidence of maternal toxicity or embryotoxicity was seen in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis with 60, 120, or 180 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Betamethasone Dipropionate</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate caused malformations when given to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis by the intramuscular route at doses of 0.05 mg/kg/day. The abnormalities observed included umbilical hernias, cephalocele, and cleft palates.<br/></p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data regarding the excretion of betamethasone dipropionate or clotrimazole into breast milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production after topical application to women who are breastfeeding.</p><p>It is possible that topical administration of betamethasone dipropionate could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the motherâ€™s clinical need for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in patients under 17 years of age is not recommended.</p><p>Adverse events consistent with corticosteroid use have been observed in pediatric patients treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream. In open-label trials, 17 of 43 (39.5%) evaluable pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 16 years old) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for treatment of tinea pedis demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing. In another open-label trial, 8 of 17 (47.1%) evaluable pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 16 years old) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for treatment of tinea cruris demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing.</p><p>Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are, therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to skin atrophy, including striae, when they are treated with topical corticosteroids.</p><p>HPA axis suppression, Cushingâ€™s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p>Avoid use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the treatment of diaper dermatitis.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream under occlusion, such as in diaper dermatitis, is not recommended.</p><p>Postmarket adverse event reporting for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in patients aged 65 and above includes reports of skin atrophy and rare reports of skin ulceration. Caution should be exercised with the use of these corticosteroid-containing topical products on thinning skin.</p><h2>Clotrimazole Betamethasone Cream Description</h2><p class="First">Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream USP, 1%/0.05% (base), contains combinations of clotrimazole, USP, an azole antifungal, and betamethasone dipropionate, USP, a corticosteroid, for topical use.</p><p>Chemically, clotrimazole, USP is 1-(<span class="Italics">o</span>-Chloro-Î±,Î±-diphenylbenzyl)imidazole, with the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">17</span>ClN<span class="Sub">2</span>, a molecular weight of 344.84, and the following structural formula:</p><p> </p><p>Clotrimazole, USP is an odorless, white crystalline powder, insoluble in water and soluble in ethanol.</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate, USP has 9-Fluoro-11Î²,17,21-trihydroxy-16Î²-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17,21-dipropionate, with the molecular formula C<span class="Sub">28</span>H<span class="Sub">37</span>FO<span class="Sub">7</span>, a molecular weight of 504.59, and the following structural formula:</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate, USP is a white to creamy-white, odorless crystalline powder, insoluble in water.</p><p>Each gram of Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream USP contains 10 mg clotrimazole, USP and 0.64 mg betamethasone dipropionate, USP (equivalent to 0.5 mg betamethasone), in a white to off-white hydrophilic cream. Inactive ingredients: Ceteareth-30, cetyl alcohol, mineral oil, propylene glycol, purified water, sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, stearyl alcohol and white petrolatum; benzyl alcohol as preservative.</p><h2>Clotrimazole Betamethasone Cream - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Clotrimazole is an azole antifungal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].</span></p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action for the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris and tinea corporis is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vasoconstrictor Assay</span></p><p>Studies performed with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream indicate that these topical combination antifungal/corticosteroids may have vasoconstrictor potencies in a range that is comparable to high-potency topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate following topical application of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream has not been studied.</p><p>The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><p>Once absorbed through the skin, the pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroids are similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Clotrimazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits 14-Î±-demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. This leads to the accumulation of 14-Î±-methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol, a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane. The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system, thereby inhibiting growth of fungi.</p><p><span class="Bold">Activity <span class="Italics">In Vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">In Vivo</span></span></p><p>Clotrimazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following dermatophytes, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections, <span class="Italics">Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes,</span> and <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum</span> <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Resistance</span></p><p>Strains of dermatophytes having a natural resistance to clotrimazole have not been reported. Resistance to azoles, including clotrimazole, has been reported in some <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species.</p><p>No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of <span class="Italics">Trichophyton mentagrophytes.</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate or either component individually.</p><p>Betamethasone was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity assay (<span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>) and in the mammalian cell mutagenicity assay (CHO/HGPRT). It was positive in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, and equivocal in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p>Reproductive studies with betamethasone dipropionate conducted in rabbits at doses of 1.0 mg/kg/day by the intramuscular route and in mice up to 33 mg/kg/day by the intramuscular route indicated no impairment of fertility except for dose-related increases in fetal resorption rates in both species.</p><p>In a combined study of the effects of clotrimazole on fertility, embryofetal development, and postnatal development, male and female rats were dosed orally (diet admixture) with dose levels of 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day from 10 weeks prior to mating until 4 weeks postpartum. No adverse effects on the duration of estrous cycle, fertility, or duration of pregnancy were noted.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In clinical trials of tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis, subjects treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream showed a better clinical response at the first return visit than subjects treated with clotrimazole cream. In tinea corporis and tinea cruris, the subject returned 3 to 5 days after starting treatment, and in tinea pedis, after 1 week. Mycological cure rates observed in subjects treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream were as good as, or better than, in those subjects treated with clotrimazole cream. In these same clinical studies, patients treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream showed better clinical responses and mycological cure rates when compared with subjects treated with betamethasone dipropionate cream.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream USP is available as follows:</p><p>15 gram tube in a carton (NDC 0472-0379-15)</p><p>45 gram tube in a carton (NDC 0472-0379-45)</p><p>Store at 20Â° to 25Â°C (68Â° to 77Â°F); excursions permitted to 15Â° to 30Â°C (59Â° to 86Â°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-Approved patient labeling (Patient Information).</p><p>Inform the patient of the following:</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p><p>Advise pregnant women that clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream may increase the risk of having a low birthweight infant and to use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Lactation</span></p><p>Advise a woman to use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding.
