<html><head></head><body><h1>Mitomycin (Intravenous)</h1><p class="drug-subtitle"><b>Generic Name:</b> mitomycin (mye-toe-MYE-sin)</p><p>Mitomycin should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which may contribute to overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of mitomycin. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a serious complication of chemotherapy consisting primarily of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and irreversible renal failure, has been reported in patients receiving systemic mitomycin. The syndrome may occur at any time during systemic therapy with mitomycin as a single agent or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs; however, most cases occur at doses greater than or equal to 60 mg of mitomycin. Blood product transfusion may exacerbate the symptoms associated with this syndrome. The incidence of the syndrome has not been defined .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It is used to treat some kinds of cancer.</p><p>Mitomycin interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by mitomycin, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur for months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with mitomycin, you and your doctor should talk about the good mitomycin will do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>Mitomycin is to be administered only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using mitomycin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For mitomycin, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to mitomycin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Although there is no specific information comparing use of mitomycin in children with use in other age groups, it is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of mitomycin in the elderly with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking mitomycin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using mitomycin with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of mitomycin. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Bleeding problems</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Chickenpox (including recent exposure) or</li>
<li>Herpes zoster (shingles)—Risk of severe disease affecting other parts of the body</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Infection—Mitomycin may decrease your body's ability to fight infection</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Kidney disease—May be worsened</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of mitomycin</h2><p>Mitomycin is usually given together with certain other medicines. If you are using a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your health care professional to help you plan a way to remember to take them at the right times.</p><p>Mitomycin often causes nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your health care professional for ways to lessen these effects.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of mitomycin will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of mitomycin. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using mitomycin</h2><p>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that mitomycin is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>While you are being treated with mitomycin, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Mitomycin may lower your body's resistance and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, other persons living in your household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to you. Also, avoid persons who have taken oral polio vaccine. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you cannot take these precautions, you should consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the nose and mouth.</p><p>Mitomycin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising; black, tarry stools; blood in urine or stools; or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>If mitomycin accidentally seeps out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage the skin and cause scarring. In some patients, this may occur weeks or even months after mitomycin is given. Tell the doctor or nurse right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the place of injection or anywhere else on your skin.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Mitomycin side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p>Also, because of the way cancer medicines act on the body, there is a chance that they might cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used. These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer. Discuss these possible effects with your doctor.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor immediately</i> if any of the following side effects occur:</p><p><i>Less common</i></p><ul>
