If you do not understand these directions, ask your pharmacist, nurse, or doctor to explain them to you.</p><p>Misuse of testosterone can cause dangerous or irreversible effects, such as enlarged breasts, small testicles, infertility, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, liver disease, bone growth problems, addiction, and mental effects such as aggression and violence.</p><p>Do not share this medicine with another person.</p><p>To use Striant buccal system:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Hold one buccal system with the flat side on your fingertip. Place the curved side onto your gum, as high as possible above the left or right incisor tooth. Hold your finger on the outside of your lip over the system for 30 seconds to ensure the system is attached to the gum. If the system sticks to the cheek and not the gum, this is acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Striant buccal system should remain in place for 12 hours. To remove the system, move it slightly toward the back or front of the mouth then slide it toward the teeth from removal. With each new application, rotate to alternate sides of the mouth. This avoids scratching the gum. Check to see that the system is in place after eating, drinking, brushing the teeth, or using mouthwash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the Striant buccal system absorbs moisture from the mouth, it will begin to soften and will mold to the shape of the gum. The system does not dissolve completely, but will remain in place. It will not move until you remove it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a buccal system falls off before 8 hours of use, remove it and replace it with a new system in the same place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the buccal system and alternate sides of the mouth 12 hours after application of the original system. If a buccal system falls off after 8 hours but before 12 hours of use, remove the system and replace it with a new system above the opposite incisor. This will serve as the second dose for the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not chew or swallow Striant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regularly inspect the gum where the Striant buccal system is applied. Promptly report any changes to your doctor or dentist.</p>
