Progesterone is a female hormone important for ovulation and menstruation. Progesterone causes changes in the lining of your uterus, making it easier for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus at the beginning of pregnancy. Progesterone then helps your body maintain the pregnancy.</p><p>Endometrin is used in fertility treatment as part of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) for women unable to get pregnant due to a lack of natural progesterone in the body.</p><p>Endometrin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not use Endometrin if you have: a history of stroke or blood clot, circulation problems, liver disease, breast or uterine cancer, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or if you have recently had a tubal pregnancy or an incomplete abortion.</p><p>When used as part of fertility treatment, Endometrin may be given for up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy.
