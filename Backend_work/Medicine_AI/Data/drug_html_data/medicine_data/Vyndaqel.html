Transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) is a condition in which abnormal deposits of TTR protein build-up in many parts of the body, interfering with normal function. A build-up of TTR in the heart can lead to heart failure.</p><p>People with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis have a DNA mutation that can be passed from one generation to the next. People with wild-type ATTR amyloidosis do not have abnormal DNA and cannot pass on the condition.</p><p>Vyndaqel is used in adults with hereditary or wild type ATTR to treat cardiomyopathy (damage of the heart muscle) caused by a build-up of TTR.</p><p>Vyndaqel may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Follow all directions on your medicine label and package.
