In clinical studies, this dose rate provided an average of 3.8 mg of lincomycin per pound of body weight per day.</p><h3>Treatment Period</h3><p class="First">The drug should be administered for a minimum of 5 consecutive days beyond the disappearance of symptoms (bloody stools) up to a maximum of 10 consecutive days. If water treatment is discontinued prior to this time, a lincomycin treatment program may be continued with lincomycin premix at 100 grams lincomycin per ton of complete feed as the sole ration according to label directions.</p><h3>Administration</h3><p class="First">This bottle will medicate 768 gallons of drinking water providing 250 mg/gallon. A dose of 3.8 mg lincomycin per pound of body weight may be maintained by medicating the drinking water at a concentration of 250 mg per gallon of drinking water when pigs are consuming 1.5 gallons per 100 lbs of body weight per day. Under these circumstances the concentration of lincomycin required in medicated water may be adjusted to compensate for variations in age and weight of animals, the nature and severity of disease symptoms, environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water consumption.</p><p>For use in automatic water proportioners, prepare the stock solution by dissolving <span class="Italics">one</span> bottle in <span class="Italics">six</span> gallons of water: then adjust the proportioner to deliver 1 ounce of stock solution per gallon of drinking water.</p><p>NOTE: After a treatment program is discontinued, a control program for swine dysentery may be followed by feeding lincomycin premix at 40 grams lincomycin per ton of complete feed as the sole ration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">BROILER CHICKENS: Directions for Use</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Lincomix</h2><p class="First">Lincomix Soluble Powder is indicated for the control of necrotic enteritis caused by <span class="Italics">Clostridium perfringens</span> susceptible to lincomycin.</p><h2>Lincomix Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First">Administer at a dose rate of 64 mg of lincomycin per gallon of drinking water.</p><h3>Treatment Period</h3><p class="First">Start medication as soon as the diagnosis of necrotic enteritis is determined.

Discard medicated drinking water if not used within 2 days. Fresh stock solution should be prepared daily. 2. If clinical signs of bloody scours (watery, mucoid or bloody stools) have not improved during the first 6 days of medication, discontinue treatment and redetermine the diagnosis. 3. Occasionally, swine fed lincomycin may within the first two days after the onset of treatment develop diarrhea and/or swelling of the anus. On rare occasions, some pigs may show reddening of the skin and irritable behavior. These conditions have been self-correcting within five to eight days without discontinuing the lincomycin treatment. 4. The safety of lincomycin has not been demonstrated for pregnant swine or swine intended for breeding. 5. Do not allow rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, horses, or ruminants access to water containing lincomycin. Ingestion by these species may result in severe gastrointestinal effects. 6. Do not use the water treatment and the feed treatment simultaneously. 7. Not for use in layer and breeder chickens.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Store at Controlled Room Temperature 20° to 25° C (68 ° to 77° F).</p><p class="First">Restricted Drug (California)-Use Only as Directed</p><p>Made in China<br/>
