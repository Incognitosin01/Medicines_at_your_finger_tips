The oral dispenser is graduated in 0.5 mL increments. A 50 mg dose is equivalent to 1 mL. If the calculated dose exceeds 900 mg, a maximum dose of 900 mg should be administered. Valganciclovir for oral solution is the preferred formulation since it provides the ability to administer a dose calculated according to the formula above; however, valganciclovir tablets may be used if the calculated doses are within 10% of available tablet strength (450 mg). For example, if the calculated dose is between 405 mg and 495 mg, one 450 mg tablet may be taken. Before prescribing valganciclovir tablets, pediatric patients should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets.</p><h3>Preparation of Valganciclovir for Oral Solution</h3><p class="First">Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the bottle/cap and the table after reconstitution. Prior to dispensing to the patient, valganciclovir for oral solution must be prepared by the pharmacist as follows <span class="Italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]</span>:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Measure 91 mL of purified water in a graduated cylinder.</li>
<li>Shake the valganciclovir for oral solution bottle to loosen the powder. Remove the child resistant bottle cap and add approximately half the total amount of water for constitution to the bottle and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute. Add the remainder of water and shake the closed bottle well for about 1 minute. This prepared solution contains 50 mg of valganciclovir free base per 1 mL.</li>
<li>Remove the child resistant bottle cap and push the bottle adapter into the neck of the bottle.</li>
<li>Close bottle with child resistant bottle cap tightly. This will assure the proper seating of the bottle adapter in the bottle and child resistant status of the cap.</li>
<li>Store constituted oral solution under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no longer than 49 days. Do not freeze.</li>
<li>Write the discard date of the constituted oral solution on the bottle label.</li>
</ul><p>The patient package insert, which includes the dosing instructions for patients, and 2 oral dispensers should be dispensed to the patient <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Recommendation for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Serum creatinine levels or estimated creatinine clearance should be monitored regularly during treatment. Dosage recommendations for adult patients with reduced renal function are provided in Table 2. For adult patients on hemodialysis (CrCl less than 10 mL/min), a dose recommendation for valganciclovir tablets cannot be given <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p>                            (140 – age [years]) x (body weight [kg])</p><p>For males =     ——————————————————</p><p>                                 (72) x (serum creatinine [mg/dL])</p><p>For females = 0.85 x male value</p><p>Dosing in pediatric patients with renal impairment can be done using the recommended equations because CrCl is a component in the calculation <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Handling and Disposal</h3><p class="First">Caution should be exercised in the handling of valganciclovir tablets and valganciclovir for oral solution.  Tablets should not be broken or crushed. Because valganciclovir is considered a potential teratogen and carcinogen in humans, caution should be observed in handling broken tablets, the powder for oral solution, and the constituted oral solution <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5)]</span>. Avoid direct contact with broken or crushed tablets, the powder for oral solution, and the constituted oral solution with skin or mucous membranes. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water, and rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water.</p><p>Handle and dispose valganciclovir according to guidelines for antineoplastic drugs because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity).<span class="Sup">2</span></p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Valganciclovir for oral solution: 50 mg per mL, supplied as a white to slightly yellow powder for constitution, forming a colorless to brownish yellow fruity flavored solution. Available in glass bottles containing approximately 100 mL of solution after constitution.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Valganciclovir for oral solution is contraindicated in patients who have had a demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to valganciclovir, ganciclovir, or any component of the formulation <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hematologic Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and bone marrow failure including aplastic anemia have been reported in patients treated with valganciclovir or ganciclovir. Valganciclovir should be avoided if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/μL, the platelet count is less than 25,000/μL, or the hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL. Valganciclovir should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Cytopenia may occur at any time during treatment and may worsen with continued dosing. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 days to 7 days after discontinuing drug. In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, treatment with hematopoietic growth factors may be considered.</p><p>Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving valganciclovir <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>, complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in infants, in patients with renal impairment, and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1,000 cells/μL at the beginning of treatment. Increased monitoring for cytopenias may be warranted if therapy with oral ganciclovir is changed to valganciclovirbecause of increased plasma concentrations of ganciclovir after valganciclovir administration <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Acute Renal Failure</h3><p class="First">Acute renal failure may occur in:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering valganciclovir to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]</span>.</li>
<li>Patients receiving potential nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering valganciclovir to patients receiving potential nephrotoxic drugs.</li>
<li>Patients without adequate hydration. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients.</li>
</ul><h3>Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Based on animal data and limited human data, valganciclovir at the recommended human doses may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with use of valganciclovir<span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Ganciclovir may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. When given to pregnant rabbits at dosages resulting in 2 times the human exposure (based on AUC), ganciclovir caused malformations in multiple organs of the fetuses. Maternal and fetal toxicity were also observed in pregnant mice and rabbits. Therefore, valganciclovirhas the potential to cause birth defects. Pregnancy should be avoided in female patients taking valganciclovir and in females with male partners taking valganciclovir . Females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with valganciclovir because of the potential risk to the fetus. Similarly, males should be advised to use condoms during and for at least 90 days following treatment with valganciclovir <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis</h3><p class="First">Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Valganciclovir should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">

The most common reported adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in greater than or equal to 20% of pediatric solid organ transplant recipients treated with valganciclovir for oral solution or tablets are diarrhea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, and headache.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice.</p><p>Valganciclovir, a prodrug of ganciclovir, is rapidly converted to ganciclovir after oral administration. Adverse reactions known to be associated with ganciclovir usage can therefore be expected to occur with valganciclovir.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions in Adults:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Treatment of CMV Retinitis in AIDS Patients:</span> In a clinical study for the treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected patients, the adverse reactions reported by patients receiving valganciclovir tablets (n=79) or intravenous ganciclovir (n=79) for 28 days of randomized therapy (21 days induction dose and 7 days maintenance dose), respectively, included diarrhea (16%, 10%), nausea (8%, 14%), and headache (9%, 5%). The incidence of adverse reactions was similar between the group who received valganciclovir tablets and the group who received intravenous ganciclovir. The frequencies of neutropenia (ANC less than 500/μL) were 11% for patients receiving valganciclovir tablets compared with 13% for patients receiving intravenous ganciclovir. Anemia (Hgb less than 8 g/dL) occurred in 8% of patients in each group. Other laboratory abnormalities occurred with similar frequencies in the two groups.</p><p>Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities are available for 370 patients who received maintenance therapy with valganciclovir tablets 900 mg once daily in two open-label clinical trials.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients) in pediatric kidney transplant patients treated with valganciclovir until Day 200 post-transplant were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, leukopenia, neutropenia, headache, abdominal pain, tremor, pyrexia, anemia, blood creatinine increased, vomiting, and hematuria.</p><p>In general, the safety profile was similar in pediatric patients compared to that observed in adult patients.

There were no differences in the incidence of severe (Grade 4) anemia or thrombocytopenia in patients treated 100 days or 200 days with valganciclovir.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of valganciclovir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. As valganciclovir is rapidly and extensively converted to ganciclovir, any adverse reactions associated with ganciclovir might also occur with valganciclovir.</p><p>-   Anaphylactic reaction<br/>
-   Agranulocytosis<br/>
-   Granulocytopenia</p><p>In general, the adverse reactions reported during the postmarketing use of valganciclovir were similar to those identified during the clinical trials.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">In vivo drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted with valganciclovir. However, because valganciclovir is rapidly and extensively converted to ganciclovir, drug-drug interactions associated with ganciclovir will be expected for valganciclovir. Drug-drug interaction studies with ganciclovir were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Following concomitant administration of valganciclovir and other renally excreted drugs, patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug.</p><p>Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 9.</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 9:   Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with Ganciclovir</span></p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>After oral administration, valganciclovir (prodrug) is converted to ganciclovir (active drug) and, therefore, valganciclovir is expected to have reproductive toxicity effects similar to ganciclovir. In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two-times the human exposure. There are no available human data on use of valganciclovir or ganciclovir in pregnant women to establish the presence or absence of drug-associated risk. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and the risk of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS) CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in these infants is about 10% and approximately 50% to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Doses resulting in two-times the human exposure of ganciclovir (based on the human AUC following a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg per kg of ganciclovir) resulted in maternal and embryo-fetal toxicity in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in the rabbits. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice.

Valganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, valganciclovir should be administered with consideration of their renal status.

After oral administration, both diastereomers are rapidly converted to ganciclovir by intestinal and hepatic esterases. Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo.</p><p>In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly (half-life 18 hours). As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54 by ganciclovir triphosphate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity:</span> The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC<span class="Sub">50</span>), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus, the reported EC<span class="Sub">50</span> values of ganciclovir that inhibit human CMV replication in cell culture (laboratory and clinical isolates) have ranged from 0.08 μM to 22.94 μM (0.02 mcg/mL to 5.75 mcg/mL).

Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1x the AUC of the recommended human intravenous dose. Valganciclovir caused similar effects on spermatogenesis in mice, rats, and dogs. These effects were reversible at lower doses but irreversible at higher doses.
