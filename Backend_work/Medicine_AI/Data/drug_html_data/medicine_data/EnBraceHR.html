Vitamin B9 stimulates specifically the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in persons suffering from certain megaloblastic anemias.</p><p>Folic acid, folinic acid and l-methylfolate metabolism results in the creation of tetrahydrofolic acid by different pathways. Both folinic acid and levomefolic acid do not require dihydrofolate reductase (DHR), however folic acid does.</p><p>[Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>]</p><p>Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia, GI lesions, and neurological damage that begins with an inability to produce myelin and is followed by gradual degeneration of the axon and nerve head. Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the anti-anemia factor in purified liver extract.</p><p>Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) - such as methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), may also inhibit cobalamin intracellular conversion due to impaired ability to metabolize folic acid.</p><h2>iNDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">EnBrace® HR</span> is indicated in the treatment of folate-induced macrocytic anemias before, during or after pregnancy including megaloblastic anemias, and the prevention of cobalamin deficiency.</p><p><span class="Italics">Requirements of vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> and/or vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> in excess of normal (due to pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be met with oral supplementation.</span></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS​:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">GENERAL:</span></p><p>0.1 mg or more of folic acid daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that the hematological remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The safe tolerable limit for folic acid (in preparations) is 1 mg [emphasis added].</p><p>Folic acid is not a substitute for vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> - although it may improve vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-deficient megaloblastic anemia. Exclusive use of folic acid in treating vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>-deficient megaloblastic anemia could result in progressive and irreversible neurologic damage. Specifically, <span class="Bold">vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> deficiency allowed to progress over 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord</span> - as observed when folate therapy is used as the only hematopoietic agent.</p><p>Doses of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.</p><p>A dietary deficiency of only vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is rare; multiple vitamin deficiency is expected in any dietary deficiency. No single regimen fits all cases, and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">DRUG INTERACTIONS:</span></p><p>Colchicine, para-aminosalicylic acid, and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY:</span></p><p>There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> or folate is carcinogenic. Pernicious anemia is associated with increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">PREGNANCY, NURSING MOTHERS, PEDIATRIC USE:</span></p><p>Vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> and vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> are essential vitamins and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> and vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science - National Research Council for lactating women should be consumed during pregnancy.</p><p>Vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> and vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> appear in the milk of nursing mothers in concentrations which approximate the mother’s vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> and vitamin B<span class="Sub">9</span> blood level. Amounts of vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academies of Science - National Research Council for lactating women should be consumed during lactation.</p><p>Intake in pediatric patients should be in the amount recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science - National Research Council.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of entire body may occur with administration of vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span>.</span></p><p>Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION​:</h2><p class="First">The adult dose is one capsule daily <span class="Italics">preferably on an empty stomach</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">As a general rule reticulocyte plasma count, folate and vitamin B12 status must be obtained prior to treatment.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dose.
