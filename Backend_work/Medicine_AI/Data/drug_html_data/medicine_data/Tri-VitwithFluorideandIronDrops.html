</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Active ingredient for caries prophylaxis:<br/></span> Each 1 mL contains 0.25 mg fluoride as sodium fluoride.</p><h3>Other ingredients:</h3><p class="First">ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), caramel color, cholecalciferol (Vitamin D<span class="Sub">3</span>), ferrous sulfate, flavor, glycerin, polysorbate 80, purified water, vitamin A palmitate</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Hydroxyapatite is the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the <span class="Italics">hydroxyapatite</span> in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal, <span class="Italics">fluorapatite</span>. Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished:<span class="Sup">1</span> 1) Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2) After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3) After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from water, food, supplementary fluoride, and smaller amounts from saliva.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">Supplementation of the diet with vitamins A, D, C, and iron. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxsis. TRI-VIT with FLUORIDE 0.25 mg and IRON (vitamins A, D, C, iron and fluoride) drops provide fluoride in drop form for infants and young children from 6 months to 3 years of age in areas where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride and for children ages 3 to 6 years in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride.<span class="Sup">2,3</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a</span> <span class="Bold">leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a</span> <span class="Bold">doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">The suggested dose should not be exceeded since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. When prescribing TRI-VIT with FLUORIDE 0.25 mg and IRON drops: 1) Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2) Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3) Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis.</p><p>TRI-VIT with FLUORIDE 0.25 mg and IRON drops should be dispensed in the original plastic container, since contact with glass leads to instability and precipitation. (The amount of sodium fluoride in the 50-mL size is well below the maximum to be dispensed at one time according to recommendations of the American Dental Association.)</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">1 mL daily, or as prescribed. May be dropped directly into mouth with dropper, or mixed with fruit juice, cereal or other food. <span class="Bold">USE FULL DOSAGE</span></p><p><span class="Bold">DISPENSE</span> in original container</p><p class="First">Occasional deepening of color has no significant effect on vitamin potency.</p><p>While taking drops with iron, a slight darkening of the teeth may occur. Brushing will minimize this temporary condition.</p><p>After opening, store away from direct light.</p><p><span class="Bold">Your doctor or dentist is the best</span> <span class="Bold">source of counsel and guidance in your childâ€™s fluoride supplementation.</span></p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">Manufactured for:<br/>
