These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For onabotulinumtoxina, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to onabotulinumtoxina or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of onabotulinumtoxinA in children. However, safety and effectiveness have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age for <i>upper limb spasticity and lower limb spasticity (except spasms caused by cerebral palsy</i>), in children younger than 12 years of age for <i>blepharospasm or strabismus</i>, in children younger than 16 years of age for <i>cervical dystonia</i>, or in children younger than 18 years of age for <i>chronic migraine, hyperhidrosis, or overactive bladder</i>. Use of onabotulinumtoxinA to treat glabellar lines, forehead lines, and lateral canthal lines is not recommended in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of onabotulinumtoxinA in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of onabotulinumtoxina.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of onabotulinumtoxina</h2><p>Your doctor will give you onabotulinumtoxina in a medical facility. It is given as a shot under your skin or into one of your muscles.</p><p>You may be given medicine to numb the area where the shot will be injected. If you receive the medicine around your eyes, you may be given eye drops or ointment to numb the area. After your injection, you may need to wear a protective contact lens or eye patch.</p><p>If you are treated for <i>excessive sweating</i>, shave your underarms but do not use deodorant for 24 hours before your injection. Avoid exercise, hot foods or liquids, or anything else that could make you sweat for 30 minutes before your injection.</p><p>Onabotulinumtoxina works slowly. For <i>neck disorders</i>, you should have improvement within 2 to 6 weeks after your injection. For <i>upper arm stiffness</i>, you should have improvement within 4 to 6 weeks after your injection. <i>Eyelid disorders</i> should improve within 3 days to 2 weeks after your injection. <i>Strabismus</i> should improve within 1 or 2 days after the injection, and the improvement should last for 2 to 6 weeks. Once your condition has improved, the medicine will last about 3 months, then the effects of the medicine will slowly go away. You might need more injections when the effects of the medicine wear off. The recommended re-treatment schedule for <i>chronic migraine</i> is every 12 weeks.</p><p>Onabotulinumtoxina should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Your doctor will only use onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox® or Botox® Cosmetic) to treat your condition. Other botulinum toxin products may not work the same way and require a different dose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using onabotulinumtoxina</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits</i>. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to receive it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Serious muscle reactions have occurred within hours to weeks after receiving onabotulinumtoxina. If you start to have muscle weakness, loss of bladder control, or trouble with swallowing, talking, or breathing, call your doctor right away. In some patients, these problems could be life-threatening and may require an immediate treatment in a hospital or clinic.</p><p>Onabotulinumtoxina may make your muscles weak and cause vision problems (eg, bleeding inside the eye). <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how onabotulinumtoxina affects you</i>.</p><p>Onabotulinumtoxina may reduce blinking of the eye which can lead to an increased risk of eye problems (eg, corneal exposure and ulcers). Tell your doctor right away if you have a reduced blinking of the eye.</p><p>Onabotulinumtoxina may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are receiving onabotulinumtoxina.</p><p>After you have received onabotulinumtoxina and your vision or muscle spasms are better, you may find that you are a lot more active than you were before. You should slowly increase your activities to allow time for your body to get stronger. Also, before you start an exercise program, check with your doctor.</p><p>Onabotulinumtoxina may increase your chances of having bronchitis or upper respiratory tract infections when given for upper limb spasticity. Tell your doctor right away if you have trouble breathing, sneezing, sore throat, coughing, or a fever.</p><p>Onabotulinumtoxina may cause a condition called autonomic dysreflexia in patients with nervous system disorders (eg, spinal cord injury). It can be a life-threatening condition and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have headache, increased sweating, slow heartbeat, warmth or redness in your face, neck, or arm, or have problems in urinating while using onabotulinumtoxina.</p><p>Onabotulinumtoxina is made from donated human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted viruses to people who have received them, although the risk is low. Human donors and donated blood are both tested for viruses to keep the transmission risk low. Talk with your doctor about this risk if you are concerned.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have difficulty urinating or a burning sensation while urinating after receiving onabotulinumtoxina.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Onabotulinumtoxina side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
