It is unique in its ability to stimulate respiration at dosages considerably below those required to evoke cerebral cortical stimulation. In nonanesthetized animals the dose required to produce convulsions is some 70 to 75 times the dose required to produce respiratory stimulation. In anesthetized subjects, doxapram also exerts a marked arousal effect. Thus, by promoting the restoration of normal ventilation and producing early arousal following general anesthesia, doxapram minimizes or prevents the undesirable effects of post-anesthetic respiratory depression or hypoventilation and hastens recovery.</p><h2>Chemistry1</h2><p class="First">The chemical name of doxapram hydrochloride is 1-ethyl-4-(2-morpholinoethyl)-3,3-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinone hydrochloride hydrate.</p><p>The material is prepared as a clear, colorless, 2% aqueous solution with a pH of 3.5 to 5 and is stable at room temperature. Stability studies of 24 months’ duration have shown doxapram to have excellent stability characteristics. The preservative is benzyl alcohol, 0.9% and sterilization is accomplished by aseptic filtration technique. Doxapram is compatible with 5% and 10% dextrose in water or normal saline, but is physically incompatible with alkaline solutions, such as 2.5% thiopental sodium.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Species Variation<span class="Sup">2,5</span></span><br/>
The dog responds more dramatically to doxapram than other species. For example, arousal was not observed in the rat, and the cat responded poorly in comparison with the dog. Respiratory stimulation was slight in the rat, moderate in the cat and marked in the dog and horse.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect on EEG<span class="Sup">3</span></span><br/>
Studies show that while the drug acted selectively on respiratory centers of the brain, higher doses stimulated other parts of the neuraxis. The cortex appeared to be the most resistant part of the central nervous system to the action of the drug.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect on Cerebral Blood Flow<span class="Sup">4</span></span><br/>
The effect of doxapram on cerebral blood flow in anesthetized dogs was determined. Initially, the drug caused a transient increase in blood flow concomitant with rising femoral arterial blood pressure. Flow then diminished while the blood pressure remained elevated. The decreased flow appeared to coincide with marked respiratory stimulation; its occurrence, therefore, is consistent with the known vasoconstrictor effect of hypocapnia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effect on Pituitary-Adrenal Axis<span class="Sup">5</span></span><br/>
Intravenous administration of doxapram (20 mg/kg) to anesthetized dogs resulted in a marked rise in the adrenal venous blood level of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. The peak response occurred at 5–7 minutes in most animals. Hypophysectomy prevented this effect of doxapram.</p><p><span class="Bold">Site and Mechanism of Action<span class="Sup">2,3,4,7</span></span><br/>
Doxapram appeared to stimulate respirations primarily by an effect on the brain stem, since sectioning of reflex pathways did not abolish its action. The detection of increased electrical activity in both the inspiratory and expiratory centers of the medulla, at doses as low as 0.2 mg/kg, constituted confirmation of this site of action. Only after higher doses were other parts of the brain and spinal cord stimulated. Also, cross circulation experiments have shown that doxapram acts mainly through direct stimulation of central respiratory centers.</p><p>The pressor response to doxapram appears to be primarily due to stimulation of brain stem vasomotor areas and it is mediated through the sympathoadrenal system. Adrenalectomy and/or drugs which inhibit transmission at sympathetic ganglia or at sympathetic neuroeffector sites were capable of reducing the pressor response to doxapram. Spinal section at C2 abolished the pressor effect.</p><p>Intravenous infusion of doxapram to dogs resulted in a prompt and marked increase in total blood and urinary catecholamines.</p><p><span class="Bold">Therapeutic Ratio<span class="Sup">2</span></span><br/>
Doxapram did not produce convulsions as readily as did other respiratory stimulants. In unanesthetized animals the ratios between convulsant and respiratory stimulant doses of several such drugs were as follows: doxapram, 70; ethamivan, 35; bemegride, 15; pentylenetetrazol, 4; and picrotoxin, 2.3. In animals anesthetized with barbiturates, it was not possible to establish this ratio for doxapram because convulsions could not be produced.</p><p><span class="Bold">Interaction with Other Drugs<span class="Sup">2,5,10,11,13</span></span><br/>
The respiratory stimulant effects of doxapram in dogs were not blocked by anesthetic doses of the following: phenobarbital sodium, pentobarbital sodium, thiopental sodium, secobarbital sodium, halothane and methoxyflurane. In dogs and cats, doxapram stimulated respiration that was severely depressed with morphine or meperidine. However, convulsions occurred in cats, a species in which morphine is known to be convulsant.</p><p>The respiratory stimulant effects of doxapram in horses were not blocked by anesthetic doses of the following: chloral hydrate, chloral hydrate plus magnesium sulfate and pentobarbital sodium.</p><p>Nialamide potentiated the respiratory stimulant action of doxapram in dogs and reserpine suppressed this action. In curarized dogs, the respiratory response varied inversely with the degree of muscle relaxation existing at the time doxapram was administered.</p><p>Doxapram antagonized the depressant effects of chlorpromazine, mephenesin and methocarbamol on spinal reflexes in unanesthetized cats.</p><p>Various combinations of analeptics in acute barbiturate narcosis in dogs have been compared, including metaraminol and phenylephrine, methetharimide and amphetamine, methetharimide and phenylephrine, pentylenetetrazol and phenylephrine, pentylenetetrazol and amphetamine, doxapram and phenylephrine, and doxapram alone. While most combinations improved respiratory minute volume quickly, doxapram gave the best response of all. In a similar study comparing the effects of doxapram and various analeptic combinations in dogs, only doxapram was conspicuously effective in increasing ventilation and in shortening sleeping time.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption, Distribution and Fate<span class="Sup">5,8</span></span><br/>
Respiratory stimulation was observed in the anesthetized dog after administration by the following routes: intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, oral, sublingual and subcutaneous.</p><p>Spectrophotometric methods were applied to the determination of blood levels and urinary excretion in dogs given doxapram, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, intravenously. Blood concentrations of doxapram and/or its metabolites were at peak levels immediately after injection and declined rapidly in the first hour. The concentration then further decreased slowly, and an appreciable amount was still present at the end of 24 hours. One dog was given doxapram labeled with radioactive carbon in the 2-position of the pyrrolidinone ring. Blood levels were slightly higher and urinary excretion was slightly lower by isotope assay than by chemical assay. The feces contained 29% of the administered radioactivity after 48 hours and an additional 9% in the following 24 hours.</p><h2>Animal Toxicology5,9</h2><p class="First">Oral toxicity studies were carried out in nine dogs and sixty rats for 30 days. Dogs were given doxapram orally by capsule at doses of 20, 50 and 125 mg/kg/day, and one group received the drug intravenously at 20 mg/kg/day. Rats received the drug by stomach tube at 40, 80 and 160 mg/kg/day, with one group receiving 20 mg/kg intravenously daily. Four dogs died, three while receiving the high dose of 125 mg/kg and one at 50 mg/kg. At each dosage level signs of tremor, lacrimation, excessive salivation, occasional vomiting, diarrhea, stiffness of the extremities and respiratory stimulation were observed in all dogs. The hemogram, urinalysis and blood chemistry showed no changes which were considered attributable to the drug.</p><p>Histologically, the central nervous system in both species showed congestion, perivascular hemorrhages and petechial hemorrhages. These changes were interpreted as resembling hypoxic changes. The experiments were repeated in dogs at 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day and no such lesions were seen.</p><p>The acute LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of doxapram appears to be in the same dose range for various species of animals including mice, rats, adult dogs, newborn dogs and cats. The intravenous LD<span class="Sub">50</span> was approximately 75 mg/kg while the oral and subcutaneous LD<span class="Sub">50</span>’s were three to four times greater and the intraperitoneal LD<span class="Sub">50</span> about twice as great.</p><p>No significant irritation was produced when a saline solution of doxapram at a pH of 4.3 was administered intramuscularly to rabbits at concentrations of 1, 2 and 4%. On the other hand, aqueous solutions of the same concentrations caused tissue irritation in rabbits when given subcutaneously.</p><p><span class="Bold">Safety Margin for the Various Species<span class="Sup">2,9</span></span></p><p>The acute LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of doxapram HCl in unanesthetized animals appears to be in the same dose range for various species of animals including mice, rats, adult and neonatal dogs and cats. Intravenously, the LD<span class="Sub">50</span> was determined to be approximately 75 mg/kg. The oral and subcutaneous LD<span class="Sub">50</span> was three to four times the intravenous LD<span class="Sub">50</span> whereas the intraperitoneal LD<span class="Sub">50</span> was about twice as great.<span class="Sup">2,9</span></p><p>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of doxapram HCl in unanesthetized animals appears to be in the same dose range for various species of animals including mice, rats, adult and neonatal dogs and cats. Intravenously, the highest MTD tested was determined to be approximately 40 mg/kg. The oral and subcutaneous MTD was three or four times the intravenous MTD whereas the intraperitoneal MTD was about twice as great.</p><p>The highest dose given intravenously to horses was 66 mg per 100 lbs with chloral hydrate anesthesia, and 60 mg per 100 lbs with gas anesthesia. All animals responded normally and no toxic symptoms were observed.</p><h2>Clinical Studies5,12,14</h2><p class="First">The clinical use of doxapram in lightly and deeply anesthetized animals has confirmed the respiratory stimulant and arousal effects previously demonstrated in the laboratory. In one study with 48 dogs and 18 cats subjected to various surgical procedures using pentobarbital sodium as the anesthetic, marked increases in ventilation occurred within one minute following a single intravenous injection of 5 mg doxapram per kg of body weight (2.5 mg/lb). The most dramatic improvement occurred in lightly anesthetized dogs pretreated with either promazine or fentanyl-droperidol and atropine. Doxapram accelerated the return of pedal reflexes in all animals.</p><p>Doxapram consistently sustained an increased heart rate beginning one minute after injection. A second injection generally failed to further increase heart rate. EKG disturbances of T-wave polarity and magnitude occurred with the use of doxapram but tended to abate with time. Second injections of doxapram generally did not aggravate the EKG distortions.</p><p>Ten animals had pre-existing EKG signs of cardiac damage and tolerated doxapram well.</p><p>In another study with 73 dogs subjected to various surgical procedures using methoxy-flurane or halothane as the anesthetic, the arousal time was materially shortened, and respiratory minute volume and rate were increased following a single intravenous injection ranging from 0.08 to 1.95 mg/lb with an average dose of 0.44 mg/lb.</p><p>Doxapram was effective in intravenous dosages of 1 mg/kg or less in increasing ventilation and reducing arousal time, especially following methoxyflurane. Tidal volume and respiratory rates were increased; the response normally occurred in 10–20 seconds following injection. No side effects were observed. There were 35 dogs under halothane and 33 dogs under methoxyflurane anesthesia in this study.</p><p>In 20 horses subjected to various surgical procedures using intravenous injections of chloral hydrate, chloral hydrate and magnesium sulfate, or pentobarbital as the anesthetic, marked increases in ventilation occurred within 30 seconds following intravenous injection of doxapram in doses ranging from 0.20 to 0.66 mg/lb with an average of 0.28 mg/lb for chloral hydrate and 0.20 to 0.25 mg/lb for the barbiturate. The arousal time was materially shortened, and respiratory minute volume and rate were increased.</p><p>In another study involving 34 horses anesthetized with halothane or methoxyflurane, marked increases in ventilation occurred within 30 seconds following intravenous injection of doxapram in doses ranging from 0.08 to 0.50 mg/lb, with an average dose of 0.21 mg/lb. The average recovery time was shortened by one-third or more.</p><p>In a series of clinical studies involving 80 neonatal canine patients, suffering respiratory crisis following dystocia or caesarean section, doxapram administered either subcutaneously, sublingually or via umbilical vein in doses from 1–5 drops (1–5 mg) resulted in a marked increase in ventilation and survival of all patients.</p><p>In a series of clinical studies involving 16 neonatal feline patients, suffering respiratory crisis following caesarean section or dystocia, doxapram administered either subcutaneously or sublingually (topically) in doses of 1 to 2 drops (1–2 mg) resulted in a marked increase in ventilation and survival of all patients.</p><h2>Indications</h2><p class="First">For Dogs, Cats and Horses:<br/>
