Meningococcal bacteria can infect the spinal cord and brain, causing meningitis that can be fatal. Meningococcal disease can also lead to permanent and disabling medical problems.</p><p>Meningococcal disease can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The bacteria can also be passed through contact with objects the infected person has touched, such as a door handle or other surface. The bacteria can also be passed through kissing, or sharing a drinking glass or eating utensil with an infected person.</p><p>Meningococcal disease is more likely to occur in babies younger than 1 year, in young people ages 16 to 23 years, in anyone with a weak immune system, and in anyone exposed to an outbreak of the disease.</p><p>Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is used to prevent infection caused by meningococcal bacteria. The vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes your body to develop immunity to the disease. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine contains four of the most common types of meningococcal bacteria (serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135).</p><p>This vaccine will not treat an active meningococcal infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>The Menactra brand of this vaccine is for use in children and adults between the ages of 9 months and 55 years old. Menveo is for children and adults between the ages of 2 months and 55 years old.</p><p>Like any vaccine, meningococcal conjugate vaccine may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a meningococcal or diphtheria vaccine.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive a meningococcal conjugate vaccine if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a meningococcal or a diphtheria vaccine.</p><p>If you have any of these other conditions, your vaccine may need to be postponed or not given at all:</p><ul>

Younger children will need to receive 2 to 4 doses. You may need a booster dose if you have a high risk of meningococcal infection and it has been at least 4 years since you last received this vaccine.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control recommends that all teens ages 11 to 12 years be vaccinated with a single dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine. A booster dose should be given at age 16 for continued protection when teens are at highest risk of meningococcal disease.</p><p>Your booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by your local health department.</p><p>Be sure to receive all recommended doses of this vaccine or you may not be fully protected against disease.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Contact your doctor if you miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is not likely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after receiving this vaccine?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">This vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; dizziness, weakness; fast heartbeats; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>Becoming infected with meningococcal disease and developing meningitis (infection of the spinal cord and lining of the brain) is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine.
