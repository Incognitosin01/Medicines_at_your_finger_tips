Monitor patients receiving anti-inhibitor coagulant complex for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions (including severe and systemic reactions [eg, anaphylaxis with urticaria and angioedema, bronchospasm, circulatory shock]) have been observed following administration. Discontinue immediately with signs/symptoms of severe hypersensitivity reactions and provide appropriate supportive care.</p><p>• Infusion reactions: Infusion reactions (eg, chills, pyrexia, hypertension) have been reported.</p><p>• Thromboembolic events: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Thromboembolic events (including venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, MI, and stroke) have been reported following administration of anti-inhibitor coagulant complex, particularly with administration of high doses and/or in patients with thrombotic risk factors. Monitor patients receiving anti-inhibitor coagulant complex for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events,</b> especially if more than 200 units/kg/day is administered. Use with caution in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), advanced atherosclerotic disease, crush injury, septicemia, or concomitant treatment with factor VIIa. Weigh the potential benefit of treatment against the potential risk of these thromboembolic events. Monitor patients receiving &gt;100 units/kg for the development of DIC, acute coronary ischemia, and signs/symptoms of other thromboembolic events. If clinical signs/symptoms occur, discontinue use. In an emicizumab clinical trial where patients were also administered anti-inhibitor coagulant complex for breakthrough bleeding, there were reported cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA has not been reported in clinical studies of anti-inhibitor coagulant complex. Use with caution and monitor closely if anti-inhibitor coagulant complex is used in patients receiving emicizumab.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Factor VIII: Product contains minute amounts of factor VIII which may cause an anamnestic response; anamnestic rises were not associated with reduced efficacy.</p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents that could transmit disease. During the manufacturing process, screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer and/or to FDA MedWatch. Patients with signs/symptoms of infection (eg, fever, chills, drowsiness) should be encouraged to consult health care provider.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Not indicated for the treatment of bleeding episodes resulting from coagulation factor deficiencies in the absence of inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX. Use of antifibrinolytics within ~6 to 12 hours after the administration of anti-inhibitor coagulant complex is not recommended.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Monitor for control of bleeding; signs/symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute coronary ischemia, and thromboembolic events, especially if &gt;100 units/kg is administered; hemoglobin and hematocrit; hypotension; signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. <b>Note:</b> Tests used to monitor hemostatic efficacy, such as aPTT and TEG, are <b>not</b> useful for monitoring responses with anti-inhibitor coagulant complex (Hoffman 2012). Dosing to normalize these values may result in DIC.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Limited outcome information is available from a pregnancy registry following use of anti-inhibitor coagulant complex (human) in pregnant women with acquired hemophilia A (Tengborn 2012). Other products are preferred for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding events in pregnant patients with known hemophilia (NHF 2017; WFH [Srivastava 2013]; RCOG [Pavord 2017]). However, the use of anti-inhibitor coagulant complex (human) may be considered in select patients with bleeding associated with postpartum acquired hemophilia A (a recombinant product may be preferred) (Huth-Kuhne 2009; Kruse-Jarres 2017; Windyga 2019).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat hemophilia.</p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent bleeding.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
