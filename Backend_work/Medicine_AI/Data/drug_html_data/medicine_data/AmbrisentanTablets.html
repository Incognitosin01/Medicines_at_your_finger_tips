</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not administer ambrisentan to a pregnant female because it may cause fetal harm. Ambrisentan is very likely to produce serious birth defects if used by pregnant females, as this effect has been seen consistently when it is administered to animals <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span> .</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Exclude pregnancy before the initiation of treatment with ambrisentan. Females of reproductive potential must use acceptable methods of contraception during treatment with ambrisentan and for one month after treatment. Obtain monthly pregnancy tests during treatment and 1 month after discontinuation of treatment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]</span> .</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity, females can only receive ambrisentan through a restricted program called the Ambrisentan REMS program <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> .</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ambrisentan Tablets</h2><p class="First">Ambrisentan Tablets are indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1):</p><ul>
<li>To improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening.</li>
<li>In combination with tadalafil to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH, and to improve exercise ability [ <span class="Italics">see Clinical Studies (14.2)</span>].</li>
</ul><p>Studies establishing effectiveness included predominantly patients with WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (60%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (34%).</p><h2>Ambrisentan Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>2.1. Adult Dosage</h3><p class="First">Initiate treatment at 5 mg once daily, with or without tadalafil 20 mg once daily. At 4-week intervals, either the dose of ambrisentan or tadalafil can be increased, as needed and tolerated, to Ambrisentan Tablets, 10 mg or tadalafil 40 mg.</p><p>Do not split, crush, or chew tablets.</p><h3>2.2. Pregnancy Testing in Females of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Initiate treatment with ambrisentan in females of reproductive potential only after a negative pregnancy test.

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>4.1. Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Ambrisentan may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Ambrisentan is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Ambrisentan was consistently shown to have teratogenic effects when administered to animals. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span> .</p><h3>4.2. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</h3><p class="First">Ambrisentan is contraindicated in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), including IPF patients with pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group 3) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.4)]</span> .</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>5.1. Embryo-fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Ambrisentan may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and is contraindicated for use in females who are pregnant. In females of reproductive potential, exclude pregnancy prior to initiation of therapy, ensure use of acceptable contraceptive methods, and obtain monthly pregnancy tests <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.3)]</span> .</p><p>Ambrisentan is only available for females through a restricted program under a REMS <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span> .</p><h3>5.2. Ambrisentan REMS Program</h3><p class="First">For all females, ambrisentan is available only through a restricted program called the Ambrisentan REMS, because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span> .</p><p>Notable requirements of the Ambrisentan REMS program include the following:</p><ul>
<li>Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training.</li>
<li>All females, regardless of reproductive potential, must enroll in the Ambrisentan REMS program prior to initiating ambrisentan. Male patients are not enrolled in the REMS.
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Females of reproductive potential must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pharmacies that dispense ambrisentan must be certified with the program and must dispense to female patients who are authorized to receive ambrisentan.</li>

Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Peripheral edema is a known class effect of endothelin receptor antagonists, and is also a clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH. In the placebo-controlled studies, there was an increased incidence of peripheral edema in patients treated with doses of 5 or 10 mg ambrisentan compared to placebo <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> . Most edema was mild to moderate in severity.</p><p>In addition, there have been postmarketing reports of fluid retention in patients with pulmonary hypertension, occurring within weeks after starting ambrisentan. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or, in some cases, hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.</p><p>If clinically significant fluid retention develops, with or without associated weight gain, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause, such as ambrisentan or underlying heart failure, and the possible need for specific treatment or discontinuation of ambrisentan therapy.</p><p>Peripheral edema/fluid retention is more common with ambrisentan plus tadalafil than with ambrisentan or tadalafil alone.</p><h3>5.4. Pulmonary Edema with Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease (PVOD)</h3><p class="First">If patients develop acute pulmonary edema during initiation of therapy with vasodilating agents such as ambrisentan, the possibility of PVOD should be considered, and if confirmed ambrisentan should be discontinued.</p><h3>5.5. Decreased Sperm Counts</h3><p class="First">Decreased sperm counts have been observed in human and animal studies with another endothelin receptor antagonist and in animal fertility studies with ambrisentan. Ambrisentan may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis. Counsel patients about potential effects on fertility <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span> .</p><h3>5.6. Hematological Changes</h3><p class="First">Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have followed administration of other endothelin receptor antagonists and were observed in clinical studies with ambrisentan. These decreases were observed within the first few weeks of treatment with ambrisentan, and stabilized thereafter. The mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to end of treatment for those patients receiving ambrisentan in the 12-week placebo-controlled studies was 0.8 g/dL.</p><p>Marked decreases in hemoglobin (&gt;15% decrease from baseline resulting in a value below the lower limit of normal) were observed in 7% of all patients receiving ambrisentan (and 10% of patients receiving 10 mg) compared to 4% of patients receiving placebo. The cause of the decrease in hemoglobin is unknown, but it does not appear to result from hemorrhage or hemolysis.</p><p>In the long-term open-label extension of the two pivotal clinical studies, mean decreases from baseline (ranging from 0.9 to 1.2 g/dL) in hemoglobin concentrations persisted for up to 4 years of treatment.</p><p>There have been postmarketing reports of decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit that have resulted in anemia requiring transfusion.</p><p>Measure hemoglobin prior to initiation of ambrisentan, at one month, and periodically thereafter. Initiation of ambrisentan therapy is not recommended for patients with clinically significant anemia. If a clinically significant decrease in hemoglobin is observed and other causes have been excluded, consider discontinuing ambrisentan.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include:</p><ul>

</ul><h3>6.1. Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Safety data for ambrisentan are presented from two 12-week, placebo-controlled studies (ARIES-1 and ARIES-2) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and one randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in 605 patients with PAH (AMBITION) comparing ambrisentan plus tadalafil to ambrisentan or tadalafil alone. The exposure to ambrisentan in these studies ranged from 1 day to 4 years (N=357 for at least 6 months and N=279 for at least 1 year).</p><p>In ARIES-1 and ARIES-2, a total of 261 patients received ambrisentan at doses of 2.5, 5, or 10 mg once daily and 132 patients received placebo. The adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;3% more patients receiving ambrisentan than receiving placebo are shown in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Placebo</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N = 132)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ambrisentan</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N = 261)</span></p><p>Most adverse drug reactions were mild to moderate and only nasal congestion was dose-dependent.</p><p>Few notable differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed for patients by age or sex. Peripheral edema was similar in younger patients (&lt;65 years) receiving ambrisentan (14%; 29/205) or placebo (13%; 13/104), and was greater in elderly patients (≥65 years) receiving ambrisentan (29%; 16/56) compared to placebo (4%; 1/28). The results of such subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.</p><p>The incidence of treatment discontinuations due to adverse events other than those related to PAH during the clinical trials in patients with PAH was similar for ambrisentan (2%; 5/261 patients) and placebo (2%; 3/132 patients). The incidence of patients with serious adverse events other than those related to PAH during the clinical trials in patients with PAH was similar for placebo (7%; 9/132 patients) and for ambrisentan (5%; 13/261 patients).</p><p>During 12-week controlled clinical trials, the incidence of aminotransferase elevations &gt;3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) were 0% on ambrisentan and 2.3% on placebo. In practice, cases of hepatic injury should be carefully evaluated for cause.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Combination Use with Tadalafil</span></span></p><p>The mean exposure to ambrisentan + tadalafil in the AMBITION study was 78.7 weeks. The adverse reactions that occurred in &gt;5% more patients receiving ambrisentan + tadalafil than receiving ambrisentan or tadalafil monotherapy in AMBITION are shown in Table 2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ambrisentan +</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Tadalafil Combination</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Therapy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=302)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Ambrisentan</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Monotherapy</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=152)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tadalafil</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Monotherapy </span></p><p><span class="Bold">(N=151)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">n (%)</span></p><p>Peripheral edema was more frequent on combination therapy; however, there was no notable difference observed in the incidence of peripheral edema in elderly patients (≥65 years) versus younger patients (&lt;65 years) on combination therapy (44% vs. 45%) or ambrisentan monotherapy (37% vs. 39%) in AMBITION.</p><p>Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events while on randomized treatment were similar across treatment groups: 16% for ambrisentan + tadalafil, 14% for ambrisentan alone, and 13% for tadalafil alone.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Use in Patients with Prior Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (ERA) Related Serum Liver Enzyme Abnormalities</span></span></p><p>In an uncontrolled, open-label study, 36 patients who had previously discontinued endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs: bosentan, an investigational drug, or both) due to aminotransferase elevations &gt;3 x ULN were treated with ambrisentan. Prior elevations were predominantly moderate, with 64% of the ALT elevations &lt;5 x ULN, but 9 patients had elevations &gt;8 x ULN. Eight patients had been re-challenged with bosentan and/or the investigational ERA and all eight had a recurrence of aminotransferase abnormalities that required discontinuation of ERA therapy. All patients had to have normal aminotransferase levels on entry to this study. Twenty-five of the 36 patients were also receiving prostanoid and/or phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor therapy. Two patients discontinued early (including one of the patients with a prior 8 x ULN elevation). Of the remaining 34 patients, one patient experienced a mild aminotransferase elevation at 12 weeks on ambrisentan 5 mg that resolved with decreasing the dosage to 2.5 mg, and that did not recur with later escalations to 10 mg. With a median follow-up of 13 months and with 50% of patients increasing the dose of ambrisentan to 10 mg, no patients were discontinued for aminotransferase elevations. While the uncontrolled study design does not provide information about what would have occurred with re-administration of previously used ERAs or show that ambrisentan led to fewer aminotransferase elevations than would have been seen with those drugs, the study indicates that ambrisentan may be tried in patients who have experienced asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations on other ERAs after aminotransferase levels have returned to normal.</p><h3>6.2. Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions were identified during post-approval use of ambrisentan. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate reliably the frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: anemia requiring transfusion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>  heart failure (associated with fluid retention), symptomatic hypotension, and hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, rash).</p><p>Elevations of liver aminotransferases (ALT, AST) have been reported with ambrisentan use; in most cases alternative causes of the liver injury could be identified (heart failure, hepatic congestion, hepatitis, alcohol use, hepatotoxic medications). Other endothelin receptor antagonists have been associated with elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and cases of liver failure <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span> .</p><p>To report  <span class="Bold">SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>, contact Sigmapharm Laboratories, LLC, Pharmacovigilance at 1-855-332-0731 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Multiple dose coadministration of ambrisentan and cyclosporine resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in ambrisentan exposure in healthy volunteers; therefore, limit the dose of ambrisentan to 5 mg once daily when coadministered with cyclosporine <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> .</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1. Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Ambrisentan Tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated during pregnancy. There are limited data on Ambrisentan Tablets use in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, Ambrisentan Tablets were teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses which resulted in exposures of 3.5 and 1.7 times, respectively, the human dose of 10 mg per day <span class="Italics">[see Animal Data]</span>. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, advise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span> .</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Ambrisentan was teratogenic at oral dosages of ≥15 mg/kg/day (AUC 51.7 h•μg/mL) in rats and ≥7 mg/kg/day (24.7 h•μg/mL) in rabbits; it was not studied at lower dosages. These dosages are of 3.5 and 1.7 times, respectively, the human dose of 10 mg per day (14.8 h•μg/mL) based on AUC. In both species, there were abnormalities of the lower jaw and hard and soft palate, malformation of the heart and great vessels, and failure of formation of the thymus and thyroid.</p><p>A preclinical study in rats has shown decreased survival of newborn pups (mid and high dosages) and effects on testicle size and fertility of pups (high dosage) following maternal treatment with ambrisentan from late gestation through weaning. The mid and high dosages were 51 x, and 170 x (on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> body surface area basis) the maximum oral human dose of 10 mg and an average adult body weight of 70 kg. These effects were absent at a maternal dosage 17 x the human dose based on mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><h3>8.2. Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>It is not known whether ambrisentan is present in human milk. Because many drugs are present in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from ambrisentan, a decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue ambrisentan, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>8.3. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Testing</span></p><p>Female patients of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to initiation of treatment, monthly pregnancy test during treatment, and pregnancy test 1 month after stopping treatment with ambrisentan. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant. Perform a pregnancy test if pregnancy is suspected for any reason. For positive pregnancy tests, counsel patient on the potential risk to the fetus and patient options <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span> .</p><p><span class="Bold">Contraception</span></p><p>Female patients of reproductive potential must use acceptable methods of contraception during treatment with ambrisentan and for 1 month after stopping treatment with ambrisentan. Patients may choose one highly effective form of contraception (intrauterine device [IUD], contraceptive implant, or tubal sterilization) or a combination of methods (hormone method with a barrier method or two barrier methods). If a partner’s vasectomy is the chosen method of contraception, a hormone or barrier method must be used along with this method. Counsel patients on pregnancy planning and prevention, including emergency contraception, or designate counseling by another healthcare provider trained in contraceptive counseling <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span> .</p><p><span class="Bold">Infertility</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Males</span></p><p>In a 6-month study of another endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, 25 male patients with WHO functional class III and IV PAH and normal baseline sperm count were evaluated for effects on testicular function. There was a decline in sperm count of at least 50% in 25% of the patients after 3 or 6 months of treatment with bosentan. One patient developed marked oligospermia at 3 months, and the sperm count remained low with 2 follow-up measurements over the subsequent 6 weeks. Bosentan was discontinued and after 2 months the sperm count had returned to baseline levels. In 22 patients who completed 6 months of treatment, sperm count remained within the normal range and no changes in sperm morphology, sperm motility, or hormone levels were observed. Based on these findings and preclinical data <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span> from endothelin receptor antagonists, it cannot be excluded that endothelin receptor antagonists such as ambrisentan have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis. Counsel patients about the potential effects on fertility <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]</span> .</p><h3>8.4. Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of ambrisentan in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Juvenile Animal Data</span></p><p>In juvenile rats administered ambrisentan orally once daily during postnatal day 7 to 26, 36, or 62, a decrease in brain weight (-3% to -8%) with no morphologic or neurobehavioral changes occurred after breathing sounds, apnea, and hypoxia were observed, at exposures approximately 1.8 to 7.0 times human pediatric exposures at 10 mg, based on AUC.</p><h3>8.5. Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In the two placebo-controlled clinical studies of ambrisentan, 21% of patients were ≥65 years old and 5% were ≥75 years old. The elderly (age ≥65 years) showed less improvement in walk distances with ambrisentan than younger patients did, but the results of such subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously. Peripheral edema was more common in the elderly than in younger patients.</p><h3>8.6. Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan has been examined using a population pharmacokinetic approach in PAH patients with creatinine clearances ranging between 20 and 150 mL/min. There was no significant impact of mild or moderate renal impairment on exposure to ambrisentan <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . Dose adjustment of ambrisentan in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is therefore not required. There is no information on the exposure to ambrisentan in patients with severe renal impairment.</p><p>The impact of hemodialysis on the disposition of ambrisentan has not been investigated.</p><h3>8.7. Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The influence of pre-existing hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan has not been evaluated. Because there is in vitro and in vivo evidence of significant metabolic and biliary contribution to the elimination of ambrisentan, hepatic impairment might be expected to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span> . Ambrisentan is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. There is no information on the use of ambrisentan in patients with mild pre-existing impaired liver function; however, exposure to ambrisentan may be increased in these patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elevation of Liver Transaminases</span></p><p>Other endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been associated with aminotransferase (AST, ALT) elevations, hepatotoxicity, and cases of liver failure <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span> . In patients who develop hepatic impairment after ambrisentan initiation, the cause of liver injury should be fully investigated. Discontinue ambrisentan if elevations of liver aminotransferases are &gt;5 x ULN or if elevations are accompanied by bilirubin &gt;2 x ULN, or by signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction and other causes are excluded.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no experience with overdosage of ambrisentan. The highest single dose of ambrisentan administered to healthy volunteers was 100 mg, and the highest daily dose administered to patients with PAH was 10 mg once daily. In healthy volunteers, single doses of 50 mg and 100 mg (5 to 10 times the maximum recommended dose) were associated with headache, flushing, dizziness, nausea, and nasal congestion. Massive overdosage could potentially result in hypotension that may require intervention.</p><h2>Ambrisentan Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Ambrisentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist that is selective for the endothelin type-A (ET <span class="Sub">A</span>) receptor. The chemical name of ambrisentan is (+)-(2 <span class="Italics">S</span>)-2-[(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)oxy]-3-methoxy-3,3-diphenylpropanoic acid. It has a molecular formula of C <span class="Sub">22</span>H <span class="Sub">22</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>O <span class="Sub">4</span> and a molecular weight of 378.42. It contains a single chiral center determined to be the ( <span class="Italics">S</span>) configuration and has the following structural formula:</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 1 Ambrisentan Structural Formula</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><p>Ambrisentan is a white to off-white, crystalline solid. It is a carboxylic acid with a pKa of 4.0. Ambrisentan is practically insoluble in water and in aqueous solutions at low pH. Solubility increases in aqueous solutions at higher pH. In the solid state ambrisentan is very stable, is not hygroscopic, and is not light sensitive.</p><p>Ambrisentan Tablets are available as 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets for once daily oral administration. The tablets include the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. The tablets are film-coated with a coating material containing FD&amp;C Red #40 aluminum lake, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide. Ambrisentan Tablets, 5 mg tablets also contain FD&amp;C Blue #2. Each square shaped, light pink ambrisentan tablet contains 5 mg of ambrisentan. Each oval shaped, dark pink ambrisentan tablet contains 10 mg of ambrisentan. Ambrisentan Tablets are unscored.</p><h2>Ambrisentan Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>12.1. Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent autocrine and paracrine peptide. Two receptor subtypes, ET <span class="Sub">A</span> and ET <span class="Sub">B</span>, mediate the effects of ET-1 in the vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. The primary actions of ET <span class="Sub">A</span> are vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, while the predominant actions of ET <span class="Sub">B</span> are vasodilation, antiproliferation, and ET-1 clearance.</p><p>In patients with PAH, plasma ET-1 concentrations are increased as much as 10-fold and correlate with increased mean right atrial pressure and disease severity. ET-1 and ET-1 mRNA concentrations are increased as much as 9-fold in the lung tissue of patients with PAH, primarily in the endothelium of pulmonary arteries. These findings suggest that ET-1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH.</p><p>Ambrisentan is a high-affinity (K <span class="Sub">i</span>=0.011 nM) ET <span class="Sub">A</span> receptor antagonist with a high selectivity for the ET <span class="Sub">A</span> versus ET <span class="Sub">B</span> receptor (&gt;4000-fold). The clinical impact of high selectivity for ET <span class="Sub">A</span> is not known.</p><h3>12.2. Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>In a randomized, positive- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, healthy subjects received either ambrisentan 10 mg daily followed by a single dose of 40 mg, placebo followed by a single dose of moxifloxacin 400 mg, or placebo alone. Ambrisentan 10 mg daily had no significant effect on the QTc interval. The 40 mg dose of ambrisentan increased mean QTc at t <span class="Sub">max</span> by 5 ms with an upper 95% confidence limit of 9 ms. For patients receiving ambrisentan 5–10 mg daily and not taking metabolic inhibitors, no significant QT prolongation is expected.</p><p><span class="Bold">N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)</span></p><p>In AMBITION <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span> , the decrease in NT-proBNP in patients on ambrisentan plus tadalafil was observed early (Week 4) and was sustained, with a reduction of 63% on ambrisentan plus tadalafil, 50% on ambrisentan alone, and 41% on tadalafil alone at Week 24.</p><h3>12.3. Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan (S-ambrisentan) in healthy subjects is dose proportional. The absolute bioavailability of ambrisentan is not known. Ambrisentan is absorbed with peak concentrations occurring approximately 2 hours after oral administration in healthy subjects and PAH patients. Food does not affect its bioavailability. In vitro studies indicate that ambrisentan is a substrate of P-gp. Ambrisentan is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%). The elimination of ambrisentan is predominantly by non-renal pathways, but the relative contributions of metabolism and biliary elimination have not been well characterized. In plasma, the AUC of 4-hydroxymethyl ambrisentan accounts for approximately 4% relative to parent ambrisentan AUC. The in vivo inversion of S-ambrisentan to R-ambrisentan is negligible. The mean oral clearance of ambrisentan is 38 mL/min and 19 mL/min in healthy subjects and in PAH patients, respectively. Although ambrisentan has a 15-hour terminal half-life, the mean trough concentration of ambrisentan at steady-state is about 15% of the mean peak concentration and the accumulation factor is about 1.2 after long-term daily dosing, indicating that the effective half-life of ambrisentan is about 9 hours.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In Vitro Studies</span></p><p>Studies with human liver tissue indicate that ambrisentan is metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2C19, and uridine 5’-diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A9S, 2B7S, and 1A3S. In vitro studies suggest that ambrisentan is a substrate of the Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Drug interactions might be expected because of these factors; however, a clinically relevant interaction has been demonstrated only with cyclosporine <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span> . In vitro studies found ambrisentan to have little to no inhibition of human hepatic transporters. Ambrisentan demonstrated weak dose-dependent inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and NTCP (IC <span class="Sub">50</span> of 47 μM, 45 μM, and approximately 100 μM, respectively) and no transporter-specific inhibition of BSEP, BRCP, P-gp, or MRP2. Ambrisentan does not inhibit or induce drug metabolizing enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations.</p><p><span class="Italics">In Vivo Studies</span></p><p>The effects of other drugs on ambrisentan pharmacokinetics and the effects of ambrisentan on the exposure to other drugs are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 2 Effects of Other Drugs on Ambrisentan Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><p>* Omeprazole: based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in PAH patients</p><p>** Rifampin: AUC and C <span class="Sub">max</span> were measured at steady-state.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Oral carcinogenicity studies of up to two years duration were conducted at starting doses of 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day in rats (8 to 48 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] on a mg/m <span class="Sup">2</span> basis) and at 50, 150, and 250 mg/kg/day in mice (28 to 140 times the MRHD). In the rat study, the high- and mid-dose male and female groups had their doses lowered to 40 and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively, in week 51 because of effects on survival. The high-dose males and females were taken off drug completely in weeks 69 and 93, respectively. The only evidence of ambrisentan-related carcinogenicity was a positive trend in male rats, for the combined incidence of benign basal cell tumor and basal cell carcinoma of skin/subcutis in the mid-dose group (high-dose group excluded from analysis), and the occurrence of mammary fibroadenomas in males in the high-dose group. In the mouse study, high-dose male and female groups had their doses lowered to 150 mg/kg/day in week 39 and were taken off drug completely in week 96 (males) or week 76 (females). In mice, ambrisentan was not associated with excess tumors in any dosed group.</p><p>Positive findings of clastogenicity were detected, at drug concentrations producing moderate to high toxicity, in the chromosome aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes. There was no evidence for genetic toxicity of ambrisentan when tested in vitro in bacteria (Ames test) or in vivo in rats (micronucleus assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay).</p><p>The development of testicular tubular atrophy and impaired fertility has been linked to the chronic administration of endothelin receptor antagonists in rodents. Testicular tubular degeneration was observed in rats treated with ambrisentan for two years at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day (8-fold MRHD). Increased incidences of testicular findings were also observed in mice treated for two years at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day (28-fold MRHD). Effects on sperm count, sperm morphology, mating performance, and fertility were observed in fertility studies in which male rats were treated with ambrisentan at oral doses of 300 mg/kg/day (236-fold MRHD). At doses of ≥10 mg/kg/day, observations of testicular histopathology in the absence of fertility and sperm effects were also present.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>14.1. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)</h3><p class="First">Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies were conducted in 393 patients with PAH (WHO Group 1). The two studies were identical in design except for the doses of ambrisentan and the geographic region of the investigational sites. ARIES-1 compared once-daily doses of 5 mg and 10 mg ambrisentan to placebo, while ARIES-2 compared once-daily doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg ambrisentan to placebo. In both studies, ambrisentan or placebo was added to current therapy, which could have included a combination of anticoagulants, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin, but not epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, bosentan, or sildenafil. The primary study endpoint was 6-minute walk distance. In addition, clinical worsening, WHO functional class, dyspnea, and SF-36 <span class="Sup">®</span> Health Survey were assessed.</p><p>Patients had idiopathic or heritable PAH (64%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (32%), HIV infection (3%), or anorexigen use (1%).

An increase in 6-minute walk distance was observed after 4 weeks of treatment with ambrisentan, with a dose-response observed after 12 weeks of treatment. Improvements in walk distance with ambrisentan were smaller for elderly patients (age ≥65) than younger patients and for patients with secondary PAH than for patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH. The results of such subgroup analyses must be interpreted cautiously.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Worsening</span></p><p>Time to clinical worsening of PAH was defined as the first occurrence of death, lung transplantation, hospitalization for PAH, atrial septostomy, study withdrawal due to the addition of other PAH therapeutic agents, or study withdrawal due to early escape. Early escape was defined as meeting two or more of the following criteria: a 20% decrease in the 6-minute walk distance; an increase in WHO functional class; worsening right ventricular failure; rapidly progressing cardiogenic, hepatic, or renal failure; or refractory systolic hypotension.

Combination Treatment of PAH</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial (AMBITION), 605 patients with WHO Functional Class II or III PAH were randomized 2:1:1 to once daily ambrisentan plus tadalafil or to ambrisentan or tadalafil alone. Treatment was initiated with Ambrisentan Tablets 5 mg and tadalafil 20 mg. If tolerated, tadalafil was increased to 40 mg at 4 weeks and ambrisentan was increased to 10 mg at 8 weeks.</p><p>The primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of (a) death, (b) hospitalization for worsening PAH, (c) &gt;15% decrease from baseline in 6MWD combined with WHO Functional Class III or IV symptoms sustained over 14 days (short term clinical worsening), or (d) reduction in 6MWD sustained over 14 days combined with WHO Functional Class III or IV symptoms sustained over 6 months (inadequate long term clinical response).</p><p>Patients had idiopathic PAH (55%), heritable PAH (3%), or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases, congenital heart disease, stable HIV infection, or drugs or toxins (APAH, 43%). Median time from diagnosis to first study drug administration was 25 days. Approximately 32% and 68% of patients were in WHO Functional Class II and III, respectively. The mean patient age was 55.7 years (34% were ≥65 years old). Most patients were white (90%) and female (76%); 45% were North American.</p><p>Principal results are shown in Figures 6 and 7.</p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 6 Time to Primary Endpoint Event (AMBITION)</span></p><p><span class="Bold"></span></p><p><span class="Bold">Figure 7 Primary Endpoint Events and First Occurrences of Each Component at Any Time (AMBITION)</span></p><p></p><p>The treatment effect of ambrisentan plus tadalafil compared with individual monotherapy on time to first primary endpoint event was consistent across subgroups.

Long-term Treatment of PAH</h3><p class="First">In long-term follow-up of patients who were treated with ambrisentan (2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg once daily) in the two pivotal studies and their open-label extension (N=383), Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 1, 2, and 3 years were 93%, 85%, and 79%, respectively. Of the patients who remained on ambrisentan for up to 3 years, the majority received no other treatment for PAH. These uncontrolled observations do not allow comparison with a group not given ambrisentan and cannot be used to determine the long-term effect of ambrisentan on mortality.</p><h3>14.4. Adverse Effects in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)</h3><p class="First">A randomized controlled study in patients with IPF, with or without pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group 3), compared ambrisentan (N = 329) to placebo (N = 163). The study was terminated after 34 weeks for lack of efficacy, and was found to demonstrate a greater risk of disease progression or death on ambrisentan. More patients taking ambrisentan died (8% vs. 4%), had a respiratory hospitalization (13% vs. 6%), and had a decrease in FVC/DLCO (17% vs. 12%) <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4.2)]</span> .</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Ambrisentan film-coated tablets are supplied as follows:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Package</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Configuration</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Description of Tablet;</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Debossed on Tablet;</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Size</span></p><p class="First">Square shaped; light pink;</p><p>“∑” on one side and “51” on the other side;</p><p>6.6 mm Square</p><p class="First">Oval shaped; dark pink;</p><p>“∑” on one side and “52” on the other side;</p><p>9.8 mm x 4.9 mm Oval</p><p>Store at 25° C (77° F); excursions permitted to 15–30° C (59–86° F) <span class="Italics">[see USP controlled room temperature]</span>.
