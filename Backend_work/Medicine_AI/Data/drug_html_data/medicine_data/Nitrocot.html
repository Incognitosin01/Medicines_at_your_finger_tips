This medicine is also used to relieve an angina attack that is already occurring.</p><p>Nitroglycerin belongs to the group of medicines called nitrates. It works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its work load. When used regularly on a long-term basis, or just before exercise or a stressful event, this helps prevent angina attacks from occurring.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Nitrocot</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of nitroglycerin in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nitroglycerin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving nitroglycerin.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Nitrocot</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain nitroglycerin.  It may not be specific to Nitrocot. Please read with care.</b></p><p><i>Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>This medicine comes with a patient information insert. Read and follow the instructions in the insert carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Nitroglycerin is available as two types of products that are used for different reasons. The <i>extended-release capsules</i> are used every day on a specific schedule to prevent angina attacks. The <i>oral spray</i>, <i>sublingual powder</i>, and <i>sublingual tablets</i> work quickly to stop an angina attack that has already started or they can be used to prevent angina if you plan to exercise or expect a stressful event.</p><p>When you begin to feel an attack of angina starting (chest pains, tightness or squeezing in the chest), sit down. Then place a <i>sublingual powder or tablet</i> in your mouth or under your tongue. If you use the <i>oral spray</i>, you should spray it on or under the tongue. You may become dizzy, lightheaded, or faint soon after using a tablet or spray, so it is safer to sit rather than stand while the medicine is working. If you become dizzy or faint while sitting, take several deep breaths and bend forward with your head between your knees. Remain calm and you should feel better in a few minutes.</p><p>If you are taking the nitroglycerin <i>sublingual powder</i>: Empty the contents of a packet under your tongue. Close your mouth and breathe normally. Allow powder to dissolve without swallowing. Do not rinse or spit for 5 minutes after taking this medicine. Do not take more than 3 packets in 15 minutes. If you still have pain after you take a total of 3 packets, <i>this is an emergency</i>. <i>Call 911</i>. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.</p><p>Nitroglycerin <i>sublingual tablets</i> should not be chewed, crushed, or swallowed. They work much faster when absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Place the tablet under the tongue or between the cheek and gum, and let it dissolve. Do not eat, drink, smoke, or use chewing tobacco while a tablet is dissolving.</p><p>Nitroglycerin <i>sublingual tablets</i> usually give relief in 1 to 5 minutes. However, if the pain is not relieved, you may use a second tablet 5 minutes after you take the first tablet. If the pain continues for another 5 minutes, a third tablet may be used. If you still have chest pain after a total of 3 tablets, <i>contact your doctor or go to a hospital emergency room right away</i>. Do not drive yourself and <i>call 911</i>, if necessary.</p><p>You may administer 1 or 2 sprays of Nitroglycerin <i>oral spray</i> at the onset of chest pain. If the pain continues after 5 minutes, a third spray may be used. You must wait 5 minutes after the first 1 or 2 sprays before using a third spray. If you still have chest pain after a total of 3 sprays, contact your doctor or go to a hospital emergency room right away. Do not drive yourself and call 911 if necessary. Do not use more than 3 sprays in a 15-minute period.</p><p>Swallow the <i>extended-release capsule</i> whole. Do not split, crush, or chew it.</p><p>You should take the <i>extended-release capsule</i> first thing in the morning and follow the same schedule each day. This medicine works best if you have a "drug-free" period of time every day when you do not take it. Your doctor will schedule your doses during the day to allow for a drug-free time. Follow the schedule of dosing carefully so the medicine will work properly.</p><p><i>To use the oral spray</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Remove the plastic cap.</li>
<li>Do not shake the container.</li>
<li>If this is a new bottle or container, prime the pump before use by releasing a test spray. This must be done 5 or 10 times into the air away from your face and other people.</li>
<li>If this is an old bottle and you have not used it for more than 6 weeks, you must prime it again with 1 or 2 test sprays. If it is not been used within 3 months, prime it up to 5 sprays.</li>
<li>Hold the container upright with your forefinger on top of the grooved button. Open your mouth and bring the container as close to it as possible.</li>
<li>Press the button firmly with the forefinger to release the spray 1 or 2 times onto or under the tongue. Do not inhale or breathe in the spray.</li>
<li>Release the button and close your mouth, but do not swallow right away. Do not spit out the spray or rinse your mouth for at least 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>If you need a third spray, you must wait 5 minutes after the second spray. Use exactly the same steps you used for the first spray. No more than 3 sprays should be given within 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Replace the cover after using the medicine.</li>
<li>Always place the spray bottle in an upright position if not in use. Also, check the fluid level of Nitromist® container regularly. If the fluid reaches the top or middle of the hole on the side of container, this is an indicator that you must get a refill.</li>
<li>Do not use the spray near heat, an open flame, or while smoking.</li>
