It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.</p><p>Etodolac is used to treat mild to moderate pain, osteoarthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Etodolac may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Etodolac can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, especially if you use it long term or take high doses, or if you have heart disease. Do not use this medicine just before or after heart bypass surgery (coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG).</p><p>Etodolac may also cause stomach or intestinal bleeding, which can be fatal. These conditions can occur without warning while you are using etodolac, especially in older adults.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have symptoms of bleeding in your stomach or intestines. This includes black, bloody, or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.</p><p>Do not use any other over-the-counter cold, allergy, or pain medication without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Many medicines available over the counter contain aspirin or other medicines similar to etodolac (such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, or naproxen). If you take certain products together you may accidentally take too much of this type of medication. Read the label of any other medicine you are using to see if it contains aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, or naproxen. Do not drink alcohol while taking this medicine. Alcohol can increase the risk of stomach bleeding caused by etodolac. Avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays (sunlamps or tanning beds). This medicine can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and sunburn may result.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Etodolac can increase your risk of fatal heart attack or stroke, even if you don't have any risk factors.
