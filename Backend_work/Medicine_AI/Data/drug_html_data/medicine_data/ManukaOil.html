Its size ranges from a creeping plant to a small tree (of 8 m in height) and it is widely distributed in various climatic and altitudinal zones in New Zealand. The physical characteristics, such as flower and leaf color, leaf size and shape, branching habit, and foliage density vary considerably among populations. Manuka oil should not be confused with Melaleuca alternifolia (see Tea Tree Oil monograph).Melching 1997, Porter 2001, Porter 1999, USDA 2017</p><h2>History</h2><p>Early New Zealand records indicate that the plant's bark, leaves, sap, and seed capsules were used in beverages and medicinal preparations.Porter 1999 The plant was valued for its medicinal properties and wood by the indigenous Maori people; the wood was utilized for gardening tools, fishing, housing structures, and weapons.Porter 2001, Riley 1994</p><p>Captain James Cook used the leaves of the plant as a tea to combat scurvy during long explorations of the southern hemisphere; early European settlers of New Zealand adopted Captain Cook's use of the plant as a tea.Porter 2001</p><p>Commercial development of the essential oils has led to a range of OTC products marketed in New Zealand and exported to European and Asian markets. These products are used for topical treatment of various conditions including the following: Fungal and bacterial skin infections; inflammation from sunburn, insect bites, or joint pain; eczema or psoriasis. The oils also are used in perfumes and soaps.Porter 2001</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>The L. scoparium populations of New Zealand are highly variable in oil chemical composition and activity.Perry 1997, Priest 2002 Standardized steam distillation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the essential oils of 15 New Zealand L. scoparium populations identified the following in various quantities per species: alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene, rho-cymene, 1,8-cineole, linalol, methylcinnamate, alpha-farnesine, isoleptospermone, leptospermone, sesquiterpenes such as cadina-3,5-diene and delta-amorphene, and triketones.Melching 1997, Porter 1999, Perry 1997</p><p>Triterpenoids and flavonoids (including methylated and methoxylated flavonoids such as 5,7-dimethoxyflavone, 5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-methylflavone, and 5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6,8-dimethylflavan-3-one) have been identified in a dichloromethane extract of L. scoparium.Häberlein 1994, Häberlein 1998 Oligosaccharide components include maltose (the major component), isomaltose (or maltulose), kojibiose, turanose (or gentiobiose), and nigerose.Weston 1999</p><p>The average content of total flavonoids in New Zealand manuka (L. scoparium) honey was 3.06 mg per 100 g honey; the main flavonoids consisted of quercetin, isorhamnetin, chrysin, and luteolin.Yao 2003 The potentially active methylglyoxal, derived from the precursor dihydroxyacetone, has been identified in the flowers of certain species of <i>Leptospermum </i>native to New Zealand and Australia, and is found in Manuka honey.Carter 2016, White 2016</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Antimicrobial</h3><p>Manuka oil has selective antibacterial activity against gram positive organismsHarkenthal 1999 such as Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus.Rhee 1997 Manuka oil has little to no activity against gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus vulgaris.Harkenthal 1999, Kim 1999, Rhee 1997</p><p>Some studies document the activity of L. scoparium against fungi and yeast;Harkenthal 1999, Kim 1999 however, there are limited data to support these claims for L. scoparium as compared with other species of Myrtaceae (eg, kanuka or Kunzea ericoides ).Lis-Balchin 2000</p><p>Studies have been conducted on wound healing in animals, especially in horses.Carter 2016</p><p>Studies have evaluated the efficacy of Manuka honey in healing infected wounds. In neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers, Manuka honey-impregnated dressings increased healing rates and reduced the need for antibiotics in a clinical study of 63 patients versus saline dressings. However, the percentage of healed ulcers was not affected.Kamaratos 2014 While the role of honey as an anti-infective agent has been described, the additive efficacy of Manuka in the honey has not been established in robust clinical trials.Carter 2016, White 2016</p><h3>Anti-inflammatory effects</h3><h3>Animal data</h3><p>Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects have been described in published reviews.White 2016</p><h3>Clinical data</h3><p>A small clinical trial (n=19) evaluated Manuka with Kanuka essential oils as a gargle for benefit on radiotherapy-induced mucositis and symptoms. Mucositis reportedly developed significantly later in patients with the active gargle. The small sample size of most variables prevented further statistical comparisons. Mean pain scores gradually increased over treatment time with fewer patients in the active gargle group experiencing scores of 3 or higher and going the longest until that level of pain was reached; this was also reflected in the use of daily analgesics. Interestingly, patients with more family members present during treatment tended to report more frequent and more severe pain than those without family members present.Maddocks-Jennings 2009</p><p>Manuka, as the honey, has been studied in radiotherapy-induced mucositis in limited clinical trials finding no improvement on mucositis, and some effect on bacterial infection.Bardy 2012, Hawley 2014( Bardy, Hawley) A study conducted in patients with rhinosinusitis, using mankua honey nasal spray, found no endoscopically validated improvement in symptoms.Thamboo 2011</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>The pharmacological action of manuka oil for treating diarrhea, colds, and inflammation was studied on a field-stimulated guinea pig ileum. Manuka oil induced a spasmolytic effectLis-Balchin 2000, Lis-Balchin 1998; the mechanism of action is likely to be the result of a postsynaptic mechanism and associated with cAMP.Lis-Balchin 1998</p><p>L. scoparium contains a lipophilic flavonoid that specifically interacts with benzodiazepine receptors in the GABA-A receptor-chloride channel complex. A sedating and potentially anxiolytic effect was recorded in a locomotion study with rats.Häberlein 1994, Häberlein 1994</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There are no reported clinical studies of manuka oil on which dosage recommendations can be based.</p><p>Manuka honey has been used anecdotally as a prebiotic. A study evaluated the safety of consuming 20 g of honey daily for 4 weeks found no adverse effects on GI flora.Wallace 2010 20 mL of the honey taken 4 times daily for 6 weeks was evaluated in oral mucositis.Bardy 2012</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Documented adverse effects. Avoid use during pregnancy because of reported spasmolytic activity.Lis-Balchin 2000, Lis-Balchin 1998</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Clinical studies of Manuka honey in mucositis found tolerability of dosage regimens to be poor.Bardy 2012, Hawley 2014</p><p>L. scoparium contains a lipophilic flavonoid that specifically interacts with benzodiazepine receptors (GABA-A receptor-chloride channel complex).Bardy 2012, Hawley 2014</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>There are limited clinical toxicological data on manuka oil in the scientific literature. Anecdotal information from OTC use of topical manuka oil products suggests good potential for its future use as an antimicrobial agent.Porter 2001 Avoid use during pregnancy because of reported spasmolytic activity.Lis-Balchin 2000, Lis-Balchin 1998</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
