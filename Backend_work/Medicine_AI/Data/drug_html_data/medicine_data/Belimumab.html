Monoclonal antibodies are made to target and destroy only certain cells in the body. This may help to protect healthy cells from damage.</p><p>Belimumab is used together with other lupus medicines to treat active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Belimumab helps decrease disease activity more than when the other medicines are used alone.</p><p>Belimumab is for use in adults and children at least 5 years old.</p><p>Belimumab is not for use in people who have severe kidney problems caused by SLE, or have active SLE that affects the central nervous system (brain, nerves, and spinal cord).</p><p>Belimumab may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>When  belimumab is injected into a vein, tell your caregiver right away if you feel anxious, nauseated, light-headed, itchy, or short of breath.</p><p>Belimumab affects your immune system. <b>You may get infections more easily, even serious or fatal infections.</b> Call your doctor if you have a fever, chills, cough with mucus, skin sores, warmth or redness under your skin, increased urination, or burning when you urinate.</p><p>Belimumab may also cause heart problems. Call your doctor at once if you have chest pain, nausea, dizziness, sweating, and trouble breathing.</p><p>Report any new or worsening mental health symptoms to your doctor, such as: depression, mood or behavior changes, trouble sleeping, or thoughts about hurting yourself or others.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use belimumab if you are allergic to it.</p><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had:</p><ul>

</li>
</ul><p>an active or chronic infection;</p><p>depression or mental illness;</p><p>suicidal thoughts or actions;</p><p>cancer; or</p><p>if you are using cyclophosphamide, biologic medicines, or other monoclonal antibody medicines.</p><p>Belimumab may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Ask your doctor about your individual risk.</p><p>Some people have thoughts about suicide while using belimumab. Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.</p><p><b>Belimumab may affect the immune system of your baby if you use this medicine while you are pregnant.</b> Use effective birth control to prevent pregnancy while you are using belimumab and for at least 4 months after your last dose. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant.</p><p>Belimumab may affect your baby's immune system, but having SLE during pregnancy may cause complications such as worsened lupus, eclampsia (dangerously high blood pressure), premature birth, miscarriage, or growth problems in the unborn baby. SLE in the mother may also cause lupus or heart problems to develop in the newborn. The benefit of treating SLE may outweigh any risks to the baby.</p><p>If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry to track the effects of belimumab on the baby. <b>Make sure any doctor caring for your newborn baby knows if you used belimumab while you were pregnant.</b></p><p>It may not be safe to breastfeed while using this medicine.

The medicine must be given slowly, and the infusion can take about 1 hour to complete.</p><p>Belimumab is also injected under the skin, usually once per week.
