Serum T<sub>4</sub>  and T<sub>3</sub> concentrations can be reduced for several weeks with use but effect will not be maintained.</p><p>Following radioactive iodine exposure, potassium iodide blocks uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid, reducing the risk of thyroid cancer.</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Hyperthyroidism: 24 to 48 hours; Peak effect: 10 to 15 days after continuous therapy</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Antiseptic: </b>Topical antiseptic</p><p><b>Thyroidectomy preparation: </b>Treatment of hyperthyroidism in the immediate preoperative period in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Iodine therapy is not recommended in the preoperative setting in patients with thyrotoxicosis caused by a toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter due to the risk of exacerbating hyperthyroidism (Ross 2016).</p><p><b>Thyroid storm: </b>Treatment of thyroid storm (as part of a multimodality treatment approach).</p><p><b>Note:</b> The American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines for the management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis recommend potassium iodide and iodine (Lugol's solution) as an acceptable alternative to saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) in the management of adults with thyrotoxic crisis/thyroid storm (Ross 2016).</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Thyroid gland protection during radiopharmaceutical use</h3><p>Based on the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) procedure guidelines for 131 I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (131 I-mIBG) therapy, potassium iodide and iodine is effective and recommended for thyroid gland protection during radiopharmaceutical use.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to iodine or any component of the formulation; active tuberculosis; dermatitis herpetiformis; hypocomplementemic vasculitis; nodular thyroid disease with heart disease</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Lugol's 5% solution (potassium iodide 10% and iodine 5%) contains ~6.25 mg iodine/iodide per drop (ACR-SPR 2015).</p><p><b>Antiseptic:</b> Topical: Apply directly to area(s) requiring antiseptic.</p><p><b>Thyroidectomy preparation in patients with Graves disease:</b> Lugol's 5% solution: Oral: 5 to 7 drops (0.25 to 0.35 mL) 3 times daily; administer for 10 days before surgery; if not euthyroid prior to surgery, consider concurrent beta-blockade (eg, propranolol) in the immediate preoperative period to reduce the risk of thyroid storm (Ross 2016)</p><p><b>Thyroid gland protection during radiopharmaceutical use (off-label use):</b> Lugol's 5% solution: Oral: Regimens/protocols vary by radiopharmaceutical. Generally, ~100 mg/day of iodine/iodide is required for thyroid block (ACR-ACNM [Subramaniam 2017]; Anderson 2012; Taïeb 2012). This dose can be achieved with ~16 drops/day of Lugol's 5% solution (eg, 16 drops x 6.25 mg iodine/iodide per drop = 100 mg iodine/iodide). The following product-specific recommendations are provided in the manufacturer's labeling:</p><p>Iodine I-123 radiopharmaceuticals: 100 mg/day of iodine/iodide (manufacturer's labeling [Adreview, Datscan]).</p><p>Iodine I-125 and I-131 radiopharmaceuticals: 10 drops 3 times daily (manufacturer's labeling [Jeanatope, Megatope, Volumex]). The manufacturer's labeling for Azedra does not provide specific dosing recommendations.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Initiate 1 to 48 hours prior to radiopharmaceutical exposure and continue after radiopharmaceutical administration until risk of exposure has diminished (treatment initiation time and duration are dependent on the radiopharmaceutical agent used, consult specific protocol or labeling.</p><p><b>Thyrotoxic crisis/thyroid storm:</b> Lugol's 5% solution: Oral: 4 to 8 drops every 6 to 8 hours; initiate therapy at least 1 hour following the initial dose of antithyroid drug therapy (eg, propylthiouracil, methimazole) (Nayak 2006; Ross 2016)</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: </b>Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.
