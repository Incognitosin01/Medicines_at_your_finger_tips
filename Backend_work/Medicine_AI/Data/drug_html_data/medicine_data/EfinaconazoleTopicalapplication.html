Efinaconazole works by killing the fungus or yeast, or preventing its growth.</p><p>Efinaconazole is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using efinaconazole</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For efinaconazole, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to efinaconazole or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of efinaconazole topical solution in children 6 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 6 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of efinaconazole topical solution in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to be sensitive to the effects of efinaconazole than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of efinaconazole</h2><p><i>It is very important that you use efinaconazole only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>Efinaconazole should come with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Efinaconazole is for use <i>on the toenails and surrounding skin</i> only. It is not for use in the eyes, mouth, or vagina.</p><p>To use:</p><ul>
<li>Wash your hands with soap and water before and after using efinaconazole.</li>
<li>Apply to the affected toenail(s) by using the integrated flow-through brush applicator to spread the medicine around the whole toenail, including the cuticle, folds of the skin next to the sides of the toenail, and underneath the toenail.</li>
<li>Wait for at least 10 minutes after showering, bathing, or washing before applying the medicine.</li>
<li>Avoid pedicures, the use of nail polish, and cosmetic nail products (eg, gel nails or acrylic nails) while using efinaconazole.</li>
</ul><p>To help clear up your infection completely, it is very important that you <i>keep using efinaconazole for the full time of treatment</i>, even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days. Since fungus or yeast infections may be very slow to clear up, you may have to continue using efinaconazole every day for several weeks or more. If you stop using efinaconazole too soon, your symptoms may return. Do not miss any doses.</p><p>Efinaconazole is flammable. Do not use it near heat, an open flame, or while smoking.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of efinaconazole will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of efinaconazole. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
