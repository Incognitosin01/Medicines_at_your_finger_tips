Eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Dual therapy for <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> with lansoprazole</span>: Amoxicillin, in combination with lansoprazole delayed‑release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1‑year history of a duodenal ulcer) <span class="Bold">who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected</span>. (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.</p><h3>Usage</h3><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug‑resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>DOSAGE &amp; ADMINISTRATION</h2><h3>Dosing for Adult and Pediatric Patients &gt; 3 Months of Age</h3><p class="First">Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained.  It is recommended that there be at least 10 days’ treatment for any infection caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever.  In some infections, therapy may be required for several weeks.  It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Bold">Table 1. Dosing Recommendations for Adult and Pediatric Patients &gt; 3 Months of Age</span></p><p><span class="Sup">a</span>Dosing for infections caused by bacteria that are intermediate in their susceptibility to amoxicillin should follow the recommendations for severe infections. <span class="Sup">b</span>The children’s dosage is intended for individuals whose weight is less than 40 kg. Children weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to the adult recommendations.</p><h3>Dosing in Neonates and Infants Aged ≤12 Weeks (≤ 3 Months)</h3><p class="First">Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained.  It is recommended that there be at least 10 days’ treatment for any infection caused by <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever.  Due to incompletely developed renal function affecting elimination of amoxicillin in this age group, the recommended upper dose of AMOXICILLIN is 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours.  There are currently no dosing recommendations for pediatric patients with impaired renal function.</p><h3>Dosing for H. pylori Infection</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Triple therapy:</span> The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 30 mg lansoprazole, all given twice daily (every 12 hours) for 14 days.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Dual therapy:</span> The recommended adult oral dose is 1 gram amoxicillin and 30 mg lansoprazole, each given three times daily (every 8 hours) for 14 days.<br/>
Please refer to clarithromycin and lansoprazole full prescribing information.</p><h3>Dosing in Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe.  </p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Severely impaired patients with a glomerular filtration rate of &lt; 30 mL/min. should not receive a 875‑mg dose.</li>
<li>Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. <br/></li>
<li>Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection.</li>
<li>Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><h3>Directions for Mixing Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">Tap bottle until all powder flows freely. Add approximately 1/3 of the total amount of water for reconstitution (see Table 2) and shake vigorously to wet powder. Add remainder of the water and again shake vigorously.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Table 2. Amount of Water for Mixing Oral Suspension</span></p><p>After reconstitution, the required amount of suspension should be placed directly on the child’s tongue for swallowing. Alternate means of administration are to add the required amount of suspension to formula, milk, fruit juice, water, ginger ale, or cold drinks. These preparations should then be taken immediately. <span class="Bold"><br/>
</span><br/>
<span class="Bold">NOTE:</span> SHAKE ORAL SUSPENSION WELL BEFORE USING. Keep bottle tightly closed. Any unused portion of the reconstituted suspension must be discarded after 14 days. Refrigeration is preferable, but not required.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS &amp; STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Capsules:</span> 250 mg,</p><p>500 mg. Each capsule of amoxicillin, with royal blue opaque cap and pink opaque body, contains 250 mg or 500 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate.  The cap and body of the 250-mg capsule are imprinted with the product name AMOXIL and 250; the cap and body of the 500 mg capsule are imprinted with AMOXIL and 500.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Tablets</span>:  500 mg, 875 mg. Each tablet contains 500 mg or 875 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate. Each film-coated, capsule-shaped, pink tablet is debossed with AMOXIL centered over 500 or 875, respectively.  The 875-mg tablet is scored on the reverse side.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Powder for Oral Suspension:</span> 125 mg/5 mL, 200 mg/5 mL, 250 mg/5 mL, 400 mg/5 mL. Each 5 mL of reconstituted strawberry-flavored suspension contains 125 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate. Each 5 mL of reconstituted bubble-gum-flavored suspension contains 200 mg, 250 mg or 400 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Amoxicillin is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a serious hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to amoxicillin or to other b‑lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins).<span class="Bold"> </span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. </p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile.</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.<br/>
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing amoxicillin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Use in Patients With Mononucleosis</h3><p class="First">A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.</p><h3>Phenylketonurics</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin chewable tablets contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine.  Each 200 mg chewable tablet contains 1.82 mg phenylalanine; each 400 mg chewable tablet contains 3.64 mg phenylalanine.  The oral suspensions of Amoxicillin do not contain phenylalanine and can be used by phenylketonurics.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">      The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:</p><p>·      Anaphylactic reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></p><p>·      CDAD <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>
<br/>
The most common adverse reactions (&gt; 1%) observed in clinical trials of Amoxicillin Capsules, tablets or oral suspension were diarrhea, rash, vomiting, and nausea.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Triple therapy</span>:<span class="Bold"> </span>The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received triple therapy (amoxicillin/clarithromycin/ lansoprazole) were diarrhea (7%), headache (6%), and taste perversion (5%).<br/>
<span class="Bold">Dual therapy</span>:<span class="Bold"> </span>The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received double therapy amoxicillin/lansoprazole were diarrhea (8%) and headache (7%). For more information on adverse reactions with clarithromycin or lansoprazole, refer to the Adverse Reactions section of their package inserts.</p><h3>Postmarketing or Other Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of penicillins. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to AMOXICILLIN.<br/>
<br/>
·      <span class="Bold">Infections and Infestations:</span> Mucocutaneous candidiasis.<br/>
·      <span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal:</span> Black hairy tongue, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis.<br/>
Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].</span><br/>
·      <span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity Reactions:</span> Anaphylaxis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Serum sickness–like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema multiforme, Stevens‑Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and urticaria <span class="Bold">have been reported</span>.<br/>
·      <span class="Bold">Liver:</span> A moderate rise in AST and/or ALT has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction including cholestatic jaundice, hepatic cholestasis and acute cytolytic hepatitis <span class="Bold">have been reported.</span><br/>
·      <span class="Bold">Renal:</span> Crystalluria <span class="Bold">has been reported</span><span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
·    <span class="Bold">Hemic and Lymphatic Systems:</span> Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis <span class="Bold">have been reported</span>. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.<br/>
·      <span class="Bold">Central Nervous System:</span> Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, behavioral changes, and/or dizziness <span class="Bold">have been reported</span><br/>
·      <span class="Bold">Miscellaneous:</span> Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining<span class="Bold">) has been reported</span>. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.</p><h3>Oral Anticoagulants</h3><p class="First">Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants.  Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently.  Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.</p><h3>Allopurinol</h3><p class="First">The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.</p><h3>Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.</p><h3>Other Antibacterials</h3><p class="First">Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin.  This has been demonstrated <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.</p><h3>Effects on Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST<span class="Sup">®</span>, Benedict’s Solution, or Fehling’s Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX<span class="Sup">®</span>) be used.<br/>
<br/>
Following administration of ampicillin or amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well‑controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor &amp; Delivery</h3><p class="First">Oral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed. Dosing of AMOXICILLIN should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger (£ 3 months). <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration(2.2).]</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">An analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects.  These analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.<br/>
<br/>
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Dosing in Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &lt;30 mL/min). See Dosing in Renal Impairment (2.4) for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms.<br/>
<br/></p><p>Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin<span class="Sup">1</span>.</p><p>Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria.</p><p>Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis.</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><h2>Amoxicillin Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">Formulations of AMOXICILLIN contain amoxicillin, a semisynthetic antibiotic, an analog of ampicillin, with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many Gram‑positive and Gram‑negative microorganisms.

The effect of food on the absorption of amoxicillin from the tablets and suspension of amoxicillin has been partially investigated; 400‑mg and 875‑mg formulations have been studied only when administered at the start of a light meal.<span class="Bold"> </span><br/>
<br/>
Orally administered doses of 250‑mg and 500‑mg Amoxicillin Capsules result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 3.5 mcg/mL to 5.0 mcg/mL and 5.5 mcg/mL to 7.5 mcg/mL, respectively.<span class="Bold"> </span><br/>
<br/>
Mean amoxicillin pharmacokinetic parameters from an open, <span class="Bold">two‑part</span>, single‑dose <span class="Bold">crossover bioequivalence</span> study in 27 adults <span class="Bold">comparing 875 mg of AMOXICILLIN with 875 mg of AUGMENTIN<span class="Sup">®</span> (amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium)</span> showed that the 875‑mg tablet of Amoxicillin produces an AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of 35.4 ± 8.1 mcg·hr/mL and a C<span class="Sub">max</span> of 13.8 ± 4.1 mcg/mL. Dosing was at the start of a light meal following an overnight fast.<br/>
<br/>
Orally administered doses of amoxicillin suspension, 125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL, result in average peak blood levels 1 to 2 hours after administration in the range of 1.5 mcg/mL to 3.0 mcg/mL and 3.5 mcg/mL to 5.0 mcg/mL, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oral administration of single doses of 400‑mg chewable tablets and 400 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin to 24 adult volunteers yielded comparable pharmacokinetic data:</p><p><span class="Bold">Table 3: Mean Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Amoxicillin (400 mg chewable tablets and 400 mg/5 mL suspension) in Healthy Adults</span></p><p>* Administered at the start of a light meal.<br/>
† Mean values of 24 normal volunteers. Peak concentrations occurred approximately 1 hour after the dose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Distribution</span>: Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. In blood serum, amoxicillin is approximately 20% protein‑bound. Following a 1‑gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span>: The half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. <span class="Bold"> </span>Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine, its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].</p><p><span class="Bold"> </span> </p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First">Mechanism of Action<br/>
Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria during the stage of active multiplication.  It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanism of Resistance<br/>
Resistance to amoxicillin is mediated primarily through enzymes called beta-lactamases that cleave the beta-lactam ring of amoxicillin, rendering it inactive.<br/>
<br/>
Amoxicillin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the bacteria listed below, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.<br/>

Studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted; however, the following information is available from tests on a 4:1 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate (AUGMENTIN). Augmentin was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. Augmentin was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival. Augmentin was negative in the mouse micronucleus test and in the dominant lethal assay in mice. Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays. In a multi‑generation reproduction study in rats, no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 2 times the 3 g human dose based on body surface area).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence</h3><p class="First"> Randomized, double-blind clinical studies performed in the United States in patients with <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> and duodenal ulcer disease   (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within 1 year) evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with Amoxicillin Capsules and clarithromycin tablets as triple 14‑day therapy, or in combination with Amoxicillin Capsules as dual 14‑day therapy, for the eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span>. Based on the results of these studies, the safety and efficacy of 2 different eradication regimens were established:  <span class="Bold">Triple therapy:</span> Amoxicillin 1 gram twice daily/clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily/lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily <span class="Bold">(see Table 6).</span> <span class="Bold">Dual therapy:</span> Amoxicillin 1 gram three times daily/lansoprazole 30 mg three times daily <span class="Bold">(see Table 7).</span>  All treatments were for 14 days. <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> eradication was defined as 2 negative tests (culture and histology) at 4 to 6 weeks following the end of treatment.  Triple therapy was shown to be more effective than all possible dual therapy combinations. Dual therapy was shown to be more effective than both<span class="Bold"> </span>monotherapies. Eradication of <span class="Italics">H. pylori</span> has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.<br/>

Information for Patients</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Patients should be advised that amoxicillin may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the dose prescribed.</li>
<li>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When amoxicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by amoxicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</li>
<li>Patients should be counseled that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, and it usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Patients should be aware that amoxicillin contains a penicillin class drug product that can cause allergic reactions in some individual</li>
