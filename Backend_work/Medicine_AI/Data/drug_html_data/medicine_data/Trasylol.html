</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Trasylol® administration may cause fatal anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions. Fatal reactions have occurred with an initial (test) dose as well as with any of the components of the dose regimen. Fatal reactions have also occurred in situations where the initial (test) dose was tolerated. The risk for anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions is increased among patients with prior aprotinin exposure and a history of any prior aprotinin exposure must be sought prior to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> administration. The risk for a fatal reaction appears to be greater upon re-exposure within 12 months of the most recent prior aprotinin exposure. Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered only in operative settings where cardiopulmonary bypass can be rapidly initiated. The benefit of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> to patients undergoing primary CABG surgery should be weighed against the risk of anaphylaxis associated with any subsequent exposure to aprotinin. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.</span>)</p><h2>Trasylol Description</h2><p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> (aprotinin injection), C<span class="Sub">284</span>H<span class="Sub">432</span>N<span class="Sub">84</span>O<span class="Sub">79</span>S<span class="Sub">7</span>, is a natural proteinase inhibitor obtained from bovine lung. Aprotinin (molecular weight of 6512 daltons), consists of 58 amino acid residues that are arranged in a single polypeptide chain, cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. It is supplied as a clear, colorless, sterile isotonic solution for intravenous administration. Each milliliter contains 10,000 KIU (Kallikrein Inhibitor Units) (1.4 mg/mL) and 9 mg sodium chloride in water for injection. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide is used to adjust the pH to 4.5-6.5.</p><h2>Trasylol - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action:</h3><p class="First">Aprotinin is a broad spectrum protease inhibitor which modulates the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. SIR results in the interrelated activation of the hemostatic, fibrinolytic, cellular and humoral inflammatory systems. Aprotinin, through its inhibition of multiple mediators [e.g., kallikrein, plasmin] results in the attenuation of inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombin generation.</p><p>Aprotinin inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine release and maintains glycoprotein homeostasis. In platelets, aprotinin reduces glycoprotein loss (e.g., GpIb, GpIIb/IIIa), while in granulocytes it prevents the expression of pro-inflammatory adhesive glycoproteins (e.g., CD11b).</p><p>The effects of aprotinin use in CPB involves a reduction in inflammatory response which translates into a decreased need for allogeneic blood transfusions, reduced bleeding, and decreased mediastinal re-exploration for bleeding.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics:</h3><p class="First">The studies comparing the pharmacokinetics of aprotinin in healthy volunteers, cardiac patients undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, and women undergoing hysterectomy suggest linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 50,000 KIU to 2 million KIU. After intravenous (IV) injection, rapid distribution of aprotinin occurs into the total extracellular space, leading to a rapid initial decrease in plasma aprotinin concentration. Following this distribution phase, a plasma half-life of about 150 minutes is observed. At later time points, (i.e., beyond 5 hours after dosing) there is a terminal elimination phase with a half-life of about 10 hours.</p><p>Average steady state intraoperative plasma concentrations were 137 KIU/mL (n=10) after administration of the following dosage regimen: 1 million KIU IV loading dose, 1 million KIU into the pump prime volume, 250,000 KIU per hour of operation as continuous intravenous infusion (Regimen B). Average steady state intraoperative plasma concentrations were 250 KIU/mL in patients (n=20) treated with aprotinin during cardiac surgery by administration of Regimen A (exactly double Regimen B): 2 million KIU IV loading dose, 2 million KIU into the pump prime volume, 500,000 KIU per hour of operation as continuous intravenous infusion.</p><p>Following a single IV dose of radiolabelled aprotinin, approximately 25-40% of the radioactivity is excreted in the urine over 48 hours. After a 30 minute infusion of 1 million KIU, about 2% is excreted as unchanged drug. After a larger dose of 2 million KIU infused over 30 minutes, urinary excretion of unchanged aprotinin accounts for approximately 9% of the dose. Animal studies have shown that aprotinin is accumulated primarily in the kidney. Aprotinin, after being filtered by the glomeruli, is actively reabsorbed by the proximal tubules in which it is stored in phagolysosomes. Aprotinin is slowly degraded by lysosomal enzymes. The physiological renal handling of aprotinin is similar to that of other small proteins, e.g., insulin.</p><h2>Clinical Trials</h2><h3>Repeat Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patients:</h3><p class="First">Four placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> were conducted in the United States; of 540 randomized patients undergoing repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, 480 were valid for efficacy analysis. The following treatment regimens were used in the studies:</p><p>Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> Regimen A (2 million KIU IV loading dose, 2 million KIU into the pump prime volume, and 500,000 KIU per hour of surgery as a continuous intravenous infusion); Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> Regimen B (1 million KIU IV loading dose, 1 million KIU into the pump prime volume, and 250,000 KIU per hour of surgery as a continuous intravenous infusion); a pump prime regimen (2 million KIU into the pump prime volume only); and a placebo regimen (normal saline). All patients valid for efficacy in the above studies were pooled by treatment regimen for analyses of efficacy.</p><p>In this pooled analysis, fewer patients receiving Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, either Regimen A or Regimen B, required any donor blood compared to the pump prime only or placebo regimens. The number of units of donor blood required by patients, the volume (milliliters) of donor blood transfused, the number of units of donor blood products transfused, the thoracic drainage rate, and the total thoracic drainage volumes were also reduced in patients receiving Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> as compared to placebo.</p><h3>Primary Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patients:</h3><p class="First">Four placebo-controlled, double-blind studies of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> were conducted in the United States; of 1745 randomized patients undergoing primary CABG surgery, 1599 were valid for efficacy analysis. The dosage regimens used in these studies were identical to those used in the repeat CABG studies described above (Regimens A, B, pump prime, and placebo). All patients valid for efficacy were pooled by treatment regimen.</p><p>In this pooled analysis, fewer patients receiving Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> Regimens A, B, and pump prime required any donor blood in comparison to the placebo regimen. The number of units of donor blood required by patients, the volume of donor blood transfused, the number of units of donor blood products transfused, the thoracic drainage rate, and total thoracic drainage volumes were also reduced in patients receiving Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> as compared to placebo.</p><p>Additional subgroup analyses showed no diminution in benefit with increasing age. Male and female patients benefited from Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> with a reduction in the average number of units of donor blood transfused. Although male patients did better than female patients in terms of the percentage of patients who required any donor blood transfusions, the number of female patients studied was small.</p><p>A double-blind, randomized, Canadian study compared Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> Regimen A (n=28) and placebo (n=23) in primary cardiac surgery patients (mainly CABG) requiring cardiopulmonary bypass who were treated with aspirin within 48 hours of surgery. The mean total blood loss (1209.7 mL vs. 2532.3 mL) and the mean number of units of packed red blood cells transfused (1.6 units vs 4.3 units) were significantly less (p&lt;0.008) in the Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> group compared to the placebo group.</p><p>In a U.S. randomized study of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> Regimen A and Regimen B versus the placebo regimen in 212 patients undergoing primary aortic and/or mitral valve replacement or repair, no benefit was found for Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> in terms of the need for transfusion or the number of units of blood required.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Trasylol</h2><p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for prophylactic use to reduce perioperative blood loss and the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass in the course of coronary artery bypass graft surgery who are at an increased risk for blood loss and blood transfusion.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hypersensitivity to aprotinin.</p><p>Administration of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> to patients with a known or suspected previous aprotinin exposure during the last 12 months is contraindicated. For patients with known or suspected history of exposure to aprotinin greater than 12 months previously, see WARNINGS. Aprotinin may also be a component of some fibrin sealant products and the use of these products should be included in the patient history.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> administration, including fatal reactions in association with the initial (test) dose. The initial (test) dose does not fully predict a patient’s risk for a hypersensitivity reaction, including a fatal reaction. Fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred among patients who tolerated an initial (test) dose.</span></p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions often manifest as anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions with hypotension the most frequently reported sign of the hypersensitivity reaction. The hypersensitivity reaction can progress to anaphylactic shock with circulatory failure. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during injection or infusion of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, administration should be stopped immediately and emergency treatment should be initiated. Even when a second exposure to aprotinin has been tolerated without symptoms, a subsequent administration may result in severe hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions.</p><p>Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered only in operative settings where cardiopulmonary bypass can be rapidly initiated. Before initiating treatment with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, the recommendations below should be followed to manage a potential hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction: 1) Have standard emergency treatments for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions readily available in the operating room (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids). 2) Administration of the initial (test) dose and loading dose should be done only when the patient is intubated and when conditions for rapid cannulation and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass are present. 3) Delay the addition of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> into the pump prime solution until after the loading dose has been safely administered.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Re-exposure to aprotinin:</span> Administration of aprotinin, especially to patients who have received aprotinin in the past, requires a careful risk/benefit assessment because an allergic reaction may occur (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Although the majority of cases of anaphylaxis occur upon re-exposure within the first 12 months, there are also case reports of anaphylaxis occurring upon re-exposure after more than 12 months.</p><p>In a retrospective review of 387 European patient records with documented re-exposure to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, the incidence of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions was 2.7%. Two patients who experienced hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions subsequently died, 24 hours and 5 days after surgery, respectively. The relationship of these 2 deaths to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> is unclear. This retrospective review also showed that the incidence of a hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction following re-exposure is increased when the re-exposure occurs within 6 months of the initial administration (5.0% for re-exposure within 6 months and 0.9% for re-exposure greater than 6 months). Other smaller studies have shown that in case of re-exposure, the incidence of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions may reach the five percent level.</p><p>An analysis of all spontaneous reports from the Bayer Global database covering a period from 1985 to March 2006 revealed that of 291 possibly associated spontaneous cases of hypersensitivity (fatal: n=52 and non-fatal: n=239), 47% (138/291) of hypersensitivity cases had documented previous exposure to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>. Of the 138 cases with documented previous exposure, 110 had information on the time of the previous exposure. Ninety-nine of the 110 cases had previous exposure within the prior 12 months.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Dysfunction:</span> Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> administration increases the risk for renal dysfunction and may increase the need for dialysis in the perioperative period. This risk may be especially increased for patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those who receive aminoglycoside antibiotics or drugs that alter renal function. Data from Bayer’s global pool of placebo-controlled studies in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery showed that the incidence of serum creatinine elevations &gt;0.5 mg/dL above pre-treatment levels was statistically higher at 9.0% (185/2047) in the high-dose aprotinin (Regimen A) group compared with 6.6% (129/1957) in the placebo group. In the majority of instances, post-operative renal dysfunction was not severe and was reversible. However, renal dysfunction may progress to renal failure and the incidence of serum creatinine elevations &gt;2.0 mg/dL above baseline was slightly higher in the high-dose aprotinin group (1.1% vs. 0.8%). Careful consideration of the balance of benefits versus potential risks is advised before administering Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> to patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min) or those with other risk factors for renal dysfunction (such as perioperative administration of aminogylcoside or products that alter renal function). (See PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Laboratory Findings: Serum Creatinine.)</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General:</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Initial (Test) Dose:</span> All patients treated with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should first receive an initial (test) dose to minimize the extent of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> exposure and to help assess the potential for allergic reactions. Initiation of this initial (test) dose should occur only in operative settings where cardiopulmonary bypass can be rapidly initiated. The initial (test) dose of 1 mL Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered intravenously at least 10 minutes prior to the loading dose and the patient should be observed for manifestations of possible hypersensitivity reaction. However, even after the uneventful administration of the initial 1 mL (test) dose, any subsequent dose may cause an anaphylactic reaction. If this happens, the infusion of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should immediately be stopped and standard emergency treatment for anaphylaxis applied. It should be noted that serious, even fatal, hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions can also occur with administration of the initial (test) dose (see WARNINGS).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Allergic Reactions:</span> Patients with a history of allergic reactions to drugs or other agents may be at greater risk of developing a hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction upon exposure to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> (see WARNINGS).</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Loading Dose:</span> The loading dose of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should be given intravenously to patients in the supine position over a 20-30 minute period. Rapid intravenous administration of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> can cause a transient fall in blood pressure (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Renal Dysfunction:</span> Bayer’s global pool of placebo-controlled studies in patients undergoing CABG showed aprotinin administration was associated with elevations of serum creatinine values &gt; 0.5 mg/dL above baseline. Careful consideration of the balance of benefits and risks is advised before administering aprotinin to patients with pre-existing impaired renal function or those with other risk factors for renal dysfunction. Serum creatinine should be monitored regularly following Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> administration (see WARNINGS: Renal Dysfunction).</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Use of Trasylol</span><span class="Sup">®</span> <span class="Italics Underline">in patients undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest:</span> Two U.S. case control studies have reported contradictory results in patients receiving Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> while undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in connection with surgery of the aortic arch.</p><p>The first study showed an increase in both renal failure and mortality compared to age-matched historical controls. Similar results were not observed, however, in a second case control study. The strength of this association is uncertain because there are no data from randomized studies to confirm or refute these findings.</p><h3>Drug Interactions:</h3><p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> is known to have antifibrinolytic activity and, therefore, may inhibit the effects of fibrinolytic agents.</p><p>In study of nine patients with untreated hypertension, Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> infused intravenously in a dose of 2 million KIU over two hours blocked the acute hypotensive effect of 100mg of captopril.</p><p>Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, in the presence of heparin, has been found to prolong the activated clotting time (ACT) as measured by a celite surface activation method. The kaolin activated clotting time appears to be much less affected. However, Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should not be viewed as a heparin sparing agent (see Laboratory Monitoring of Anticoagulation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass).</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</h3><p class="First">Long-term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> or studies to determine the effect of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> on fertility have not been performed.</p><p>Results of microbial <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> tests using <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">Bacillus subtilis</span> indicate that Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> is not a mutagen.</p><p class="First">Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at intravenous doses up to 200,000 KIU/kg/day for 11 days, and in rabbits at intravenous doses up to 100,000 KIU/kg/day for 13 days, 2.4 and 1.2 times the human dose on a mg/kg basis and 0.37 and 0.36 times the human mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose. They have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mother:</h3><p class="First">Not applicable.</p><h3>Pediatric Use:</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patient(s) have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use:</h3><p class="First">Of the total of 3083 subjects in clinical studies of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, 1100 (35.7 percent) were 65 and over, while 297 (9.6 percent) were 75 and over. Of patients 65 years and older, 479 (43.5 percent) received Regimen A and 237 (21.5 percent) received Regimen B. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects for either dose regimen, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h3>Laboratory Monitoring of Anticoagulation during Cardiopulmonary Bypass:</h3><p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> prolongs whole blood clotting times by a different mechanism than heparin. In the presence of aprotinin, prolongation is dependent on the type of whole blood clotting test employed. If an activated clotting time (ACT) is used to determine the effectiveness of heparin anticoagulation, the prolongation of the ACT by aprotinin may lead to an overestimation of the degree of anticoagulation, thereby leading to inadequate anticoagulation. During extended extracorporeal circulation, patients may require additional heparin, even in the presence of ACT levels that appear adequate.</p><p>In patients undergoing CPB with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy, one of the following methods may be employed to maintain adequate anticoagulation:</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Protamine Administration</span> - In patients treated with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, the amount of protamine administered to reverse heparin activity should be based on the actual amount of heparin administered, and not on the ACT values.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Studies of patients undergoing CABG surgery, either primary or repeat, indicate that Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> is generally well tolerated. The adverse events reported are frequent sequelae of cardiac surgery and are not necessarily attributable to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy. Adverse events reported, up to the time of hospital discharge, from patients in US placebo-controlled trials are listed in the following table. The table lists only those events that were reported in 2% or more of the Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> treated patients without regard to causal relationship.</p><p>In comparison to the placebo group, no increase in mortality in patients treated with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> was observed. Additional events of particular interest from controlled US trials with an incidence of less than 2%, are listed below:</p><p>Listed below are additional events, from controlled US trials with an incidence between 1 and 2%, and also from uncontrolled, compassionate use trials and spontaneous post-marketing reports.

However, because no uniform criteria for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction were utilized by investigators, this issue was addressed prospectively in three later studies (two studies evaluated Regimen A, Regimen B and Pump Prime Regimen; one study evaluated only Regimen A), in which data were analyzed by a blinded consultant employing an algorithm for possible, probable or definite MI. Utilizing this method, the incidence of definite myocardial infarction was 5.9% in the aprotinin-treated patients versus 4.7% in the placebo treated patients. This difference in the incidence rates was not statistically significant. Data from these three studies are summarized below.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Graft Patency:</span> In a recently completed multi-center, multi-national study to determine the effects of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> Regimen A vs. placebo on saphenous vein graft patency in patients undergoing primary CABG surgery, patients were subjected to routine postoperative angiography. Of the 13 study sites, 10 were in the United States and three were non-U.S. centers (Denmark (1), Israel (2)). The results of this study are summarized below.</p><p>Although there was a statistically significantly increased risk of graft closure for Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> treated patients compared to patients who received placebo (p=0.035), further analysis showed a significant treatment by site interaction for one of the non-U.S. sites vs. the U.S. centers. When the analysis of graft closures was repeated for U.S. centers only, there was no statistically significant difference in graft closure rates in patients who received Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> vs. placebo. These results are the same whether analyzed as the proportion of patients who experienced at least one graft closure postoperatively or as the proportion of grafts closed. There were no differences between treatment groups in the incidence of myocardial infarction as evaluated by the blinded consultant (2.9% Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> vs. 3.8% placebo) or of death (1.4% Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> vs. 1.6% placebo) in this study.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity and Anaphylaxis:</span> See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.</p><p>Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions during surgery were rarely reported in U.S. controlled clinical studies in patients with no prior exposure to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> (1/1424 patients or &lt;0.1% on Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> vs. 1/861 patients or 0.1% on placebo). In case of re-exposure the incidence of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions has been reported to reach the 5% level. A review of 387 European patient records involving re-exposure to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> showed that the incidence of hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions was 5.0% for re-exposure within 6 months and 0.9% for re-exposure greater than 6 months.</p><h3>Laboratory Findings</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serum Creatinine:</span> Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> administration is associated with a risk for renal dysfunction (see WARNINGS: Renal Dysfunction).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serum Transaminases:</span> Data pooled from all patients undergoing CABG surgery in U.S. placebo-controlled trials showed no evidence of an increase in the incidence of postoperative hepatic dysfunction in patients treated with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>. The incidence of treatment-emergent increases in ALT (formerly SGPT) &gt; 1.8 times the upper limit of normal was 14% in both the Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> and placebo-treated patients (p=0.687), while the incidence of increases &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal was 5% in both groups (p=0.847).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Other Laboratory Findings:</span> The incidence of treatment-emergent elevations in plasma glucose, AST (formerly SGOT), LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and CPK-MB was not notably different between Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> and placebo treated patients undergoing CABG surgery. Significant elevations in the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and celite Activated Clotting Time (celite ACT) are expected in Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> treated patients in the hours after surgery due to circulating concentrations of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, which are known to inhibit activation of the intrinsic clotting system by contact with a foreign material (e.g., celite), a method used in these tests (see Laboratory Monitoring of Anticoagulation During Cardiopulmonary Bypass).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The maximum amount of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> that can be safely administered in single or multiple doses has not been determined. Doses up to 17.5 million KIU have been administered within a 24 hour period without any apparent toxicity. There is one poorly documented case, however, of a patient who received a large, but not well determined, amount of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> (in excess of 15 million KIU) in 24 hours. The patient, who had pre-existing liver dysfunction, developed hepatic and renal failure postoperatively and died. Autopsy showed hepatic necrosis and extensive renal tubular and glomerular necrosis. The relationship of these findings to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> therapy is unclear.</p><h2>Trasylol Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> given prophylactically in both Regimen A and Regimen B (half Regimen A) to patients undergoing CABG surgery significantly reduced the donor blood transfusion requirement relative to placebo treatment. In low risk patients there is no difference in efficacy between regimen A and B. Therefore, the dosage used (A vs. B) is at the discretion of the practitioner.</p><p>Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> is supplied as a solution containing 10,000 KIU/mL, which is equal to 1.4 mg/mL. All intravenous doses of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should be administered through a central line. <span class="Bold">DO NOT ADMINISTER ANY OTHER DRUG USING THE SAME LINE.</span> Both regimens include a 1 mL initial (test) dose, a loading dose, a dose to be added while <span class="Bold Underline">recirculating</span> the priming fluid of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit (“pump prime” dose), and a constant infusion dose. To avoid physical incompatibility of Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> and heparin when adding to the pump prime solution, each agent must be added <span class="Bold Underline">during recirculation</span> of the pump prime to assure adequate dilution prior to admixture with the other component. Regimens A and B, both incorporating a 1 mL initial (test) dose, are described in the table below:</p><p>The 1 ml initial (test) dose should be administered intravenously at least 10 minutes before the loading dose. With the patient in a supine position, the loading dose is given slowly over 20-30 minutes, after induction of anesthesia but prior to sternotomy. In patients with known previous exposure to Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span>, the loading dose should be given just prior to cannulation. When the loading dose is complete, it is followed by the constant infusion dose, which is continued until surgery is complete and the patient leaves the operating room. The “pump prime” dose is added to the <span class="Bold Underline">recirculating</span> priming fluid of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, by replacement of an aliquot of the priming fluid, prior to the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass. Total doses of more than 7 million KIU have not been studied in controlled trials.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Discard any unused portion.</p><h3>Renal and Hepatic Impairment:</h3><p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> administration is associated with a risk for renal dysfunction (see WARNINGS: Renal Dysfunction). Changes in aprotinin pharmacokinetics with age or impaired renal function are not great enough to require any dose adjustment. Pharmacokinetic data from patients with pre-existing hepatic disease treated with Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> are not available.</p><h2>How is Trasylol Supplied</h2><h2>STORAGE</h2><p class="First">Trasylol<span class="Sup">®</span> should be stored between 2<span class="Sup">°</span> and 25<span class="Sup">°</span>C (36<span class="Sup">°</span> - 77<span class="Sup">°</span>F).<br/>
