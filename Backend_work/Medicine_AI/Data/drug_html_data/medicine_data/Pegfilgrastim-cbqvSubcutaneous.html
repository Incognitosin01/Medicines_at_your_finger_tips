It is a synthetic (man-made) form of a substance that is naturally produced in your body called a colony stimulating factor. Pegfilgrastim-cbqv helps the bone marrow to make new white blood cells.</p><p>When certain cancer medicines are used to fight cancer cells, they also affect the white blood cells that fight infections. Pegfilgrastim-cbqv is used to lower the risk of getting an infection while you are being treated with cancer medicines.</p><p>Pegfilgrastim-cbqv is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using pegfilgrastim-cbqv</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
