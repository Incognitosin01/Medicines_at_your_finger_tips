Administer the dolutegravir/rilpivirine combination product at least 4 hours before or 6 hours after oral zinc salts.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Dyspepsia, hypotension, jaundice, leukopenia, nausea, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, vomiting</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Copper: IV administration of zinc without copper may cause a decrease in copper serum concentrations.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Aluminum: The parenteral product may contain aluminum; toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or renal dysfunction. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of &gt;4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses (Federal Register, 2002). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Patients on parenteral nutrition or chronic therapy should have periodic serum copper and serum zinc levels; alkaline phosphatase, taste acuity, mental depression</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Zinc crosses the placenta and can be measured in the cord blood and placenta. Fetal concentrations are regulated by the placenta (de Moraes, 2011).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to help growth and good health.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
