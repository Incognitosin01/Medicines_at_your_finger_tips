Pegfilgrastim-apgf is used to reduce the risk of infection while you are being treated with cancer medicines.</p><p>Pegfilgrastim-apgf is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using pegfilgrastim-apgf</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
