Diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced colitis. Monitor for weight loss. Discontinue use with prolonged diarrhea.</p><p>• Dyskinesias: May cause or exacerbate dyskinesias; may require dose adjustment.</p><p>• Hallucinations: May cause hallucinations.</p><p>• Impulse control disorders: Dopamine agonists used for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome have been associated with compulsive behaviors and/or loss of impulse control, which has manifested as pathological gambling, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges. Dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy has been reported to reverse these behaviors in some, but not all cases.</p><p>• Melanoma: Risk for melanoma development is increased in Parkinson disease patients; drug causation or factors contributing to risk have not been established. Patients should be monitored closely and periodic skin examinations should be performed.</p><p>• Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Entacapone, in conjunction with other drug therapy that alters brain biogenic amine concentrations (eg, MAO inhibitors, SSRIs), has been associated with a syndrome resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hyperpyrexia and confusion) (some fatal) on abrupt withdrawal or dosage reduction. Concomitant use of entacapone and nonselective MAO inhibitors should be avoided.</p><p>• Orthostatic hypotension: Entacapone may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope; Parkinson disease patients appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge; use with caution in patients at risk of hypotension (such as those receiving antihypertensive drugs) or in whom transient hypotensive episodes would be poorly tolerated (cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease). Parkinson patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk.</p><p>• Pleural/retroperitoneal fibrosis: Ergot-derived dopamine agonists have also been associated with fibrotic complications (eg, retroperitoneal fibrosis, pleural effusions, pleural thickening, and pulmonary infiltrates); monitor closely for signs and symptoms of fibrosis.</p><p>• Rhabdomyolysis: Severe cases have been reported (rare); may be related to severe, prolonged motor activity/dyskinesia.</p><p>• Somnolence: Somnolence and falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living (including operation of motor vehicles) have been reported; some cases reported that there were no warning signs for the onset of symptoms. Some events have occurred more than 1 year after start of therapy. Prior to treatment initiation, evaluate for factors that may increase these risks such as concomitant sedating medications, and the presence of sleep disorders. Monitor for drowsiness or sleepiness. If significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation occurs (eg, driving, conversations, eating), discontinue the medication. There is insufficient information to suggest that dose reductions will eliminate these symptoms. If therapy is continued, advise patient to avoid driving and other potentially dangerous activities.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Endocrine disease: Use with caution when interpreting plasma/urine catecholamine levels; falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma has been rarely reported.</p><p>• Glaucoma: Use with caution in patients with wide-angle glaucoma; monitor IOP carefully; use is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment and biliary obstruction.</p><p>• Peptic ulcer disease: Use with caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease; risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage may be increased.</p><p>• Psychotic disorders: Use with extreme caution in patients with psychotic disorders; observe patients closely for development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in elderly patients; may be more sensitive to CNS effects (eg, hallucinations) of levodopa.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Sucrose: Contains sucrose; avoid use in patients with fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Body fluid discoloration: Urine, saliva, or sweat may appear dark in color (red, brown, black) during therapy.</p><p>• Discontinuation of therapy: Dopaminergic agents have been associated with a syndrome resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome on abrupt withdrawal or significant dosage reduction after long-term use.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease; CBC, liver function tests, renal function; blood pressure, mental status; signs and symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome if abrupt discontinuation required (as with surgery); serum iron (if signs of anemia); IOP (in patients with wide-angle glaucoma); dermatologic examination (regularly while on therapy); weight loss (patients with diarrhea); cardiac function with initial dose adjustments and periodically during prolonged therapy (patients with history of MI, arrhythmia); fibrotic complications (eg, retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates or effusions, pleural thickening); signs of excessive drowsiness or sleepiness during treatment; signs of depression (including suicidal thoughts); signs and symptoms of impulse control/compulsive behaviors.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>The incidence of Parkinson disease in pregnancy is relatively rare and information related to the use of carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone in pregnant women is limited (Seier 2017; Tüfekçioglu 2018).</p><p>Refer to the entacapone and the carbidopa/levodopa monographs for additional information.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat Parkinson disease.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
