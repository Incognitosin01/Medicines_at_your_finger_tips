INFORMATION</span></p><h2>CAUTION</h2><p class="First">Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.</p><h2>Nuflor Gold Description</h2><p class="First">Nuflor Gold™ is an injectable solution of the synthetic antibiotic florfenicol. Each milliliter of sterile Nuflor Gold™ contains 300 mg of florfenicol, 300 mg of 2-pyrrolidone, and triacetin qs.</p><h2>INDICATION</h2><p class="First">Nuflor Gold™ is indicated for treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) associated with <span class="Italics">Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni,</span> and <span class="Italics">Mycoplasma bovis</span> in beef and non-lactating dairy cattle.</p><h2>Nuflor Gold Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Nuflor Gold™ should be administered once by subcutaneous injection at a dose rate of 40 mg florfenicol/kg body weight (6 mL/100 lb). Do not administer more than 15 mL at each site. The injection should be given only in the neck. Injection sites other than the neck have not been evaluated.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not use in animals that have shown hypersensitivity to florfenicol.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">NOT FOR HUMAN USE. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.</span> This product contains materials that can be irritating to skin and eyes. Avoid direct contact with skin, eyes, and clothing. In case of accidental eye exposure, flush with water for 15 minutes. In case of accidental skin exposure, wash with soap and water. Remove contaminated clothing. Consult a physician if irritation persists. Accidental injection of this product may cause local irritation. Consult a physician immediately. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information.</p><p>For customer service, to report suspected adverse reactions, or to obtain a copy of the MSDS, call 1-800-211-3573.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Not for use in animals intended for breeding purposes. The effects of florfenicol on bovine reproductive performance, pregnancy, and lactation have not been determined. Toxicity studies in dogs, rats, and mice have associated the use of florfenicol with testicular degeneration and atrophy.</p><p>Subcutaneous injection in cattle can cause a transient local tissue reaction that may result in trim loss of edible tissue at slaughter.</p><h2>RESIDUE WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Animals intended for human consumption must not be slaughtered within 44 days of treatment. Do not use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older. Use of florfenicol in this class of cattle may cause milk residues. A withdrawal period has not been established in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Transient inappetence, diarrhea, decreased water consumption, and injection site swelling have been associated with the use of florfenicol in cattle. In addition, anaphylaxis and collapse have been reported post-approval with the use of another formulation of florfenicol in cattle.</p><h2>Nuflor Gold - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">The pharmacokinetic disposition of Nuflor Gold™ was evaluated in feeder calves following a single subcutaneous injection at a dose rate of 40 mg florfenicol/kg body weight. Administration of Nuflor Gold™ resulted in florfenicol plasma concentrations of 2 µg (mcg)/mL within two hours of injection.</p><h3>MICROBIOLOGY</h3><p class="First">Florfenicol is a synthetic, broad-spectrum antibiotic active against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from domestic animals. It acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Florfenicol is generally considered a bacteriostatic drug, but it exhibits bactericidal activity against certain bacterial species. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies demonstrate that florfenicol is active against the BRD pathogens <span class="Italics">M. haemolytica, P. multocida, H. somni,</span> and <span class="Italics">M. bovis</span> and that florfenicol exhibits bactericidal activity against strains of <span class="Italics">M. haemolytica</span> and <span class="Italics">H. somni.</span></p><p>The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of florfenicol were determined for BRD isolates obtained from calves enrolled in BRD field studies in the U.S. in 2006 using methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (M31-A2). Isolates were obtained from pre-treatment nasal swabs from all calves enrolled at all four sites, post-treatment nasal swabs from treatment failures in the Nuflor Gold Injectable Solution and saline control treatment groups at three sites, and lung tissue from one calf that died in the saline control treatment group. The results are shown below in Table 2.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY</h2><p class="First">A target animal safety study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Nuflor Gold™ when administered to feeder cattle by subcutaneous injection at 1X, 3X, or 5X the labeled dose for three consecutive days (3X the labeled duration). Decreased feed consumption (inappetence), decreased water consumption, and injection site swelling were observed in the 1X, 3X, and 5X groups.</p><p>A separate injection site study conducted in cattle demonstrated that Nuflor Gold™ may induce a transient local reaction in the subcutaneous tissue and underlying muscle tissue.</p><h2>STORAGE INFORMATION</h2><p class="First">Store between 2°-30°C (36°-86°F). Use within 28 days of first use. Refrigeration is not required. The solution is light yellow to straw colored. Color does not affect potency.</p><h2>How is Nuflor Gold Supplied</h2><p class="First">Nuflor Gold™ is packaged in 100 mL (NDC 0061-5327-01), 250 mL (NDC 0061-5327-02), and 500 mL (NDC 0061-5327-03) glass sterile multiple-dose vials.</p><p class="First">Made in Germany</p><p>Intervet Inc., Roseland, NJ 07068<br/>
