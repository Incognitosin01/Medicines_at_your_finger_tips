A hemoglobin target level or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks has not been identified. Use the lowest dose that reduces the need for RBC transfusions. Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is not recommended for treatment of anemia due to cancer chemotherapy. ESAs may shorten overall survival and increase the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is not used to treat anemia caused by cancer medicines.</p><p>Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta injection causes the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. If the body does not produce enough red blood cells, severe anemia can occur. This often occurs in people with chronic kidney failure whose kidneys are not working properly.</p><p>Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta injection in children 5 to 17 years of age when it is given through a needle placed into one of your child's veins. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 5 years of age or when it is given as a shot under the skin in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution or an adjustment in the dose in patients receiving methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Bleeding problems or</li>
<li>Inflammatory or metabolic conditions, chronic or</li>
<li>Vitamin deficiency—Should be corrected first before using methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.</li>
</ul><ul>

<li>Heart or blood vessel disease or</li>
<li>Stroke, history of—The chance of side effects may be increased.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure), controlled or</li>
<li>Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Hypertension (high blood pressure), uncontrolled or</li>
<li>Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA, bone marrow disease)—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta</h2><p>Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is usually given by your doctor. However, medicines given by injection are sometimes used at home. If you will be using methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta at home, your doctor will teach you how the injections are to be given. Be sure you understand exactly how the medicine is to be injected.</p><p>Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta may be given as a shot under your skin or into a vein. If your doctor tells you to inject it a certain way, follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>If you are giving methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta at home:</p><ul>
<li>Use a new needle and unopened syringe each time you inject your medicine.</li>
<li>Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.</li>
<li>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections.</li>
<li>Check the liquid in the prefilled syringe. It must be clear or colorless to slightly yellow. Do not use it if the solution in the prefilled syringe becomes cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it. Do not shake.</li>
<li>Do not save any leftover medicine from an open syringe. Use each syringe only 1 time.</li>
</ul><p>People with kidney problems need to be on a special diet. Also, people with high blood pressure (which may be caused by kidney disease or by Mircera® treatment) may need to be on a special diet or take medicine to keep their blood pressure under control. After their anemia has been corrected, some people feel so much better that they want to eat more than before. To keep your kidney disease or your high blood pressure from getting worse, <i>it is very important that you follow your special diet and you take your medicines regularly</i>, even if you are feeling better.</p><p>In addition to Mircera®, your body needs iron and vitamins to make red blood cells. Your doctor may direct you to take iron or vitamin supplements. Be sure to follow your doctor's orders carefully.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
