It is predominantly a respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle or body aches; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; diarrhea.</p><p><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span></p><p><span class="Bold">The storage and handling information in this Fact Sheet supersedes the storage and handling information on the carton and vial labels.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Storage and Handling</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Storage Prior to First Puncture of the Vaccine Vial</span></p><p>Store unpunctured multi-dose vials of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and protect from light.

The most common systemic adverse reactions (≥10%) were headache (38.9%), fatigue (38.2%), myalgia (33.2%), and nausea (14.2%) (see Tables 1 to 4).</p><p>Severe allergic reactions, including one case of anaphylaxis in an ongoing open-label study in South Africa, have been reported following the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine administered in clinical studies.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine has been assessed in an ongoing Phase 3 Study (COV3001). A total of 43,783 individuals were enrolled in this study, of whom 21,895 adults aged 18 years and older received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine [Full Analysis Set (FAS)]. This study is being conducted in the United States (n=19,302), Brazil (n=7,278), South Africa (n=6,576), Colombia (n=4,248), Argentina (n=2,996), Peru (n=1,771), Chile (n=1,133), Mexico (n=479). In this study, 45.0% were female, 54.9% were male, 58.7% were White, 19.4% were Black or African American, 45.3% were Hispanic or Latino, 3.3% were Asian, 9.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native and 0.2% were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 5.6% were from multiple racial groups and 1.4% were unknown races (see Table 5). The median age of individuals was 52.0 years (range: 18–100). There were 4,217 (9.6%) individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline and who were included in the study. In the United States, 838 of 19,302 (4.3%) individuals were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Demographic characteristics were similar among individuals who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received saline placebo.</p><p>The safety subset includes 6,736 individuals (3,356 from the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine group, 3,380 from the placebo group). The demographic profile in the safety subset was similar in terms of age and gender compared to the FAS. A larger percentage of individuals in the safety subset were White (83.4%) compared to the FAS (58.7%). Geographically, the safety subset was limited to individuals from the United States (51.4%), Brazil (38.5%) and South Africa (10.2%). Fewer individuals in the safety subset compared to the FAS were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at baseline, 4.5% vs. 9.6%, and had at least one comorbidity 34.1% vs 40.8%.</p><p>Safety monitoring in the clinical study consisted of monitoring for: (1) solicited local and systemic reactions occurring in the 7 days following vaccination in a subset of individuals (safety subset), (2) unsolicited adverse events (AEs) occurring in the 28 days following vaccination in the safety subset, (3) medically-attended AEs (MAAEs) occurring in the 6 months following vaccination in the entire study population (FAS), (4) serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs leading to study discontinuation for the duration of the study in the entire study population.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Solicited adverse reactions</span></p><p>Shown below are the frequencies of solicited local adverse reactions (Tables 1 and 2) and systemic adverse reactions (Tables 3 and 4) reported in adults by age group in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial (COV3001) in the 7 days following vaccination.</p><p>Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had a median duration of 1 to 2 days.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Unsolicited adverse events</span></p><p>Individuals within the safety subset in study COV3001 (N=6,736) were monitored for unsolicited adverse events (AEs) for 28 days following vaccination with 99.9% (N= 6,730) of individuals completing the full 28 days of follow-up. The proportion of individuals who reported one or more unsolicited AEs was similar among those in the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine group (13.1%) and those in the placebo group (12.0%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and other events of interest</span></p><p>In study COV3001, up to a cut-off date of January 22, 2021, 54.6% of individuals had follow-up duration of 8 weeks. The median follow-up duration for all individuals was 58 days. SAEs, excluding those related to confirmed COVID-19, were reported by 0.4% (n=83) of individuals who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (N= 21,895) and 0.4% (n=96) of individuals who received placebo (N= 21,888).</p><p>Additional adverse events of interest, including but not limited to allergic, neurologic, inflammatory, vascular, and autoimmune disorders, were analyzed among all adverse events collected through protocol-specified safety monitoring procedures as well as unsolicited reporting.</p><p>Urticaria (all non-serious) was reported in five vaccinated individuals and 1 individual who received placebo in the 7 days following vaccination. In addition, an SAE of hypersensitivity, not classified as anaphylaxis, was reported in 1 vaccinated individual with urticaria beginning two days following vaccination and angioedema of the lips with no respiratory distress beginning four days following vaccination. The event was likely related to the vaccine.</p><p>An SAE of severe pain in the injected arm, not responsive to analgesics, with immediate onset at time of vaccination, and that was ongoing 74 days following vaccination was reported in an individual who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. An SAE of severe generalized weakness, fever, and headache, with onset on the day following vaccination and resolution three days following vaccination was reported in an individual who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. Both SAEs are likely related to the vaccine.</p><p>Numerical imbalances, with more events in vaccine than placebo recipients, were observed for the following serious and other adverse events of interest in individuals receiving the vaccine or placebo, respectively:</p><ul>
<li>Thromboembolic events:
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Deep vein thrombosis: 6 events (2 serious; 5 within 28 days of vaccination) vs. 2 events (1 serious; 2 within 28 days of vaccination).</li>
<li>Pulmonary embolism: 4 events (3 serious; 2 within 28 days of vaccination) vs. 1 event (serious and within 28 days of vaccination).</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Seizures: 4 events (1 serious; 4 within 28 days of vaccination) vs. 1 event (0 serious and 0 within 28 days following vaccination).</li>

Of the 21,895 individuals who received a single-dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine in COV3001, 19.5% (n=4,259) were 65 years of age and older and 3.7% (n=809) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between individuals 65 years of age and older and younger individuals.</p><h2>Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen Description</h2><p class="First">The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is a colorless to slightly yellow, clear to very opalescent sterile suspension for intramuscular injection. It contains no visible particulates. The vaccine consists of a replication-incompetent recombinant adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein in a stabilized conformation.</p><p>The Ad26 vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is grown in PER.C6 TetR cells, in media containing amino acids and no animal-derived proteins. After propagation, the vaccine is processed through several purification steps, formulated with inactive ingredients and filled into vials.</p><p>Each 0.5 mL dose of Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated to contain 5×10<span class="Sup">10</span> virus particles (VP) and the following inactive ingredients: citric acid monohydrate (0.14 mg), trisodium citrate dihydrate (2.02 mg), ethanol (2.04 mg), 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HBCD) (25.50 mg), polysorbate-80 (0.16 mg), sodium chloride (2.19 mg). Each dose may also contain residual amounts of host cell proteins (≤0.15 mcg) and/or host cell DNA (≤3 ng).</p><p>Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine does not contain a preservative.</p><p>The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex.</p><h2>Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is composed of a recombinant, replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector that, after entering human cells, expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antigen without virus propagation. An immune response elicited to the S antigen protects against COVID-19.</p><h2>CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR EUA</h2><p class="First">An ongoing, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 Study (COV3001) (NCT04505722) is being conducted in the United States, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Mexico to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a single-dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. Randomization was stratified by age (18–59 years, 60 years and older) and presence or absence of comorbidities associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19. The study allowed for the inclusion of individuals with stable pre-existing medical conditions, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy during the 3 months preceding vaccination, as well as individuals with stable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.</p><p>A total of 44,325 individuals were randomized equally to receive Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine or saline placebo. Individuals are planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19.</p><p>The primary efficacy analysis population of 39,321 individuals (19,630 in the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine group and 19,691 in the placebo group) included 38,059 SARSCoV-2 seronegative individuals at baseline and 1,262 individuals with an unknown serostatus. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among individuals who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo (see Table 5).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Efficacy Against COVID-19</span></p><p>The co-primary endpoints evaluated the first occurrence of moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 with onset of symptoms at least 14 days and at least 28 days after vaccination. Moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 was molecularly confirmed by a central laboratory based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA result using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test.</p><ul>
<li>Moderate COVID-19 was defined based on the following criteria: the individual must have experienced any one of the following new or worsening signs or symptoms: respiratory rate ≥20 breaths/minute, abnormal saturation of oxygen (SpO2) but still &gt;93% on room air at sea level, clinical or radiologic evidence of pneumonia, radiologic evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing OR any two of the following new or worsening signs or symptoms: fever (≥38.0°C or ≥100.4°F), heart rate ≥90 beats/minute, shaking chills or rigors, sore throat, cough, malaise, headache, muscle pain (myalgia), gastrointestinal symptoms, new or changing olfactory or taste disorders, red or bruised appearing feet or toes.</li>
<li>Severe/critical COVID-19 was defined based on the following criteria: the individual must have experienced any one of the following at any time during the course of observation: clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/minute, heart rate ≥125 beats/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤93% on room air at sea level, or partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &lt;300 mmHg), respiratory failure (defined as needing high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), evidence of shock (defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;60 mmHg, or requiring vasopressors), significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death.</li>
</ul><p>Final determination of severe/critical COVID-19 cases were made by an independent adjudication committee.</p><p>The median length of follow up for efficacy for individuals in the study was 8 weeks post-vaccination. Vaccine efficacy for the co-primary endpoints against moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 in individuals who were seronegative or who had an unknown serostatus at baseline was 66.9% (95% CI: 59.0; 73.4) at least 14 days after vaccination and 66.1% (95% CI: 55.0; 74.8) at least 28 days after vaccination (see Table 6).</p><p>Vaccine efficacy against severe/critical COVID-19 at least 14 days after vaccination was 76.7% (95% CI: 54.6; 89.1) and 85.4% (95% CI: 54.2; 96.9) at least 28 days after vaccination (see Table 7).</p><p>Among all COVID-19 cases with onset at least 14 days post vaccination, including cases diagnosed by a positive PCR from a local laboratory and still awaiting confirmation at the central laboratory, there were 2 COVID-19 related hospitalizations in the vaccine group (with none after 28 days) and 29 in the placebo group (with 16 after 28 days).</p><p>As of the primary analysis cut-off date of January 22, 2021, there were no COVID-19-related deaths reported in Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine recipients compared to 5 COVID-19-related deaths reported in placebo recipients, who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative at baseline.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy in Countries With Different Circulating SARS-CoV-2 Variants.</span></p><p>Exploratory subgroup analyses of vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 and severe/critical COVID-19 for Brazil, South Africa, and the United States were conducted (see Table 8). For the subgroup analyses, all COVID-19 cases accrued up to the primary efficacy analysis data cutoff date, including cases confirmed by the central laboratory and cases with documented positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a local laboratory which are still awaiting confirmation by the central laboratory, were included. The concordance rate observed up to the data cut-off date between the PCR results from the local laboratory and the central laboratory was 90.3%.</p><p>Strain sequencing was conducted on available samples with sufficient viral load from centrally confirmed COVID-19 cases (one sequence per case). As of February 12, 2021, samples from 71.7% of central laboratory confirmed primary analysis cases had been sequenced [United States (73.5%), South Africa (66.9%) and Brazil (69.3%)]. In the United States, 96.4% of strains were identified as the Wuhan-H1 variant D614G; in South Africa, 94.5% of strains were identified as the 20H/501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351 lineage); in Brazil, 69.4% of strains were identified to be a variant of the P.2 lineage and 30.6% of strains were identified as the Wuhan-H1 variant D614G. As of February 12, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 variants from the B1.1.7 or P.1 lineages were not found in any of the sequenced samples.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is supplied in a carton of 10 multi-dose vials (NDC 59676-580-15).
