Research has shown that after 48 weeks of treatment, 88% of people had undetectable HIV‑1 RNA levels and after 144 weeks, 71% of patients have undetectable HIV-1 RNA. Continue reading</p><p>Both Triumeq and Genvoya are combination one-tablet-a-day medicines that are considered first-line treatments for HIV-1 by the HHS guidelines. Because Triumeq does not contain cobicistat, an antiviral booster, it is less likely to interact with other medications and may have fewer side effects than Genvoya. People taking Genvoya do not need to be tested for the HLA-B*5701 gene, because it does not contain abacavir. Continue reading</p><h3>More FAQ</h3><ul>
