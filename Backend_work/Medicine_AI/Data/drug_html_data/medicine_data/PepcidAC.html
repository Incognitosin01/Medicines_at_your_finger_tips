</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Gastrointestinal Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Histamine H2 Antagonist</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Pepcid AC</h2><p>Famotidine is used to treat stomach ulcers (gastric and duodenal), erosive esophagitis (heartburn or acid indigestion), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition where the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. It is also used to treat certain conditions where there is too much acid in the stomach (eg, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia).</p><p>Famotidine belongs to the group of medicines known as histamine H2-receptor antagonists or H2-blockers. It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.</p><p>This medicine is available with your doctor's prescription and also without a prescription. For the prescription form, there is more medicine in each tablet. Your doctor will have special instructions on the proper use and dose for your medical problem.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Pepcid AC</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of famotidine in children weighing 40 kilograms (kg) or more. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children to treat conditions causing too much stomach acid and to prevent an ulcer from coming back.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of famotidine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving famotidine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
