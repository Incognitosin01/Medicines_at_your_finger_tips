</ul><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p>Doxycycline is a tetracycline-class antibacterial indicated in the following conditions or diseases:</p><h3>1.1 Rickettsial Infections</h3><p class="First">Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by <span class="Italics">Rickettsiae</span>.</p><h3>1.2 Sexually Transmitted Infections</h3><p class="First">Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical or rectal infections caused by <span class="Italics">Chlamydia trachomatis</span>.

For children over 8 years of age, the recommended dose is 2 mg/kg given once daily up to the adult dose. Prophylaxis should begin 1 or 2 days before travel to the malarious area. Prophylaxis should be continued daily during travel in the malarious area and for 4 weeks after the traveler leaves the malarious area.</p><h3>2.3 Inhalational Anthrax (post-exposure)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults</span>: 100 mg, of doxycycline, by mouth, twice-a-day for 60 days.</p><p><span class="Italics">Children</span>: weighing less than 45 kg, 2.2 mg/kg of body weight, by mouth, twice-a-day for 60 days. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose.</p><h3>2.4 Sprinkling the Tablet Over Applesauce</h3><p class="First">Doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets may also be administered by carefully breaking up the tablet and sprinkling the tablet contents (delayed-release pellets) on a spoonful of applesauce. The delayed-release pellets must not be crushed or damaged when breaking up the tablet. Any loss of pellets in the transfer would prevent using the dose. The applesauce/doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets mixture should be swallowed immediately without chewing and may be followed by a glass of water if desired. The applesauce should not be hot, and it should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. In the event that a prepared dose of applesauce/doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablet cannot be taken immediately, the mixture should be discarded and not stored for later use.</p><h2>DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">Doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets USP, 50 mg are yellow, oval tablets debossed with “T 0” on one side and plain on the other side. Each tablet contains specially coated yellow to brown pellets of doxycycline hyclate, USP equivalent to 50 mg of doxycycline.</p><p>Doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets USP, 200 mg are yellow, oval, scored tablets debossed with “T|9” on one side and plain on the other side. Each tablet contains specially coated yellow to brown pellets of doxycycline hyclate, USP equivalent to 200 mg of doxycycline.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">The drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines.</p><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>5.1 Tooth Development</h3><p class="First">The use of drugs of the tetracycline-class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies.</p><h3>Clostridioides Difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">C<span class="Italics">lostridioides </span>difficile</span> associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>5.3 Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First">Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.</p><h3>5.4 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth</h3><p class="First">As with other antibacterial preparations, use of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibacterial should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>5.5 Severe Skin Reactions</h3><p class="First">Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline <span class="Italics">[See Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted.</p><h3>5.6 Intracranial Hypertension</h3><p class="First">Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracycline including doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.</p><p>Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.<br/></p><h3>5.7 Skeletal Development</h3><p class="First">All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.<br/></p><h3>5.8 Antianabolic Action</h3><p class="First">The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.</p><h3>5.9 Malaria</h3><p class="First">Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of <span class="Italics">Plasmodium</span> strains.</p><p>Doxycycline does not suppress <span class="Italics">P. falciparum’s</span> sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas.<br/></p><h3>5.10 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.<br/></p><h3>5.11 Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy</h3><p class="First">In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies should be performed.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><h3>6.1 Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 200 mg as a single daily dose was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study. Doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets 200 mg was given orally once-a-day for 7 days and compared to doxycycline hyclate capsules 100 mg given orally twice daily for 7 days for the treatment of men and women with uncomplicated urogenital <span class="Italics">C. trachomatis</span> infection.</p><p>Adverse events in the Safety Population were reported by 99 (40.2%) subjects in the doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 200 mg treatment group and 132 (53.2%) subjects in the doxycycline hyclate capsules reference treatment group. Most AEs were mild in intensity. The most commonly reported adverse events in both treatment groups were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bacterial vaginitis, Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Doxycycline Hyclate Delayed-Release<br/>

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>Due to oral doxycycline’s virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines:</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal:</span> Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development [<span class="Italics">See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class.

No abnormalities of thyroid function are known to occur.</p><h2>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><h3>7.1 Anticoagulant Drugs</h3><p class="First">Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.</p><h3>7.2 Penicillin</h3><p class="First">Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin.</p><h3>7.3 Antacids and Iron Preparations</h3><p class="First">Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron-containing preparations.</p><h3>7.4 Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.</p><h3>7.5 Barbiturates and Anti-epileptics</h3><p class="First">Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline.</p><h3>7.6 Penthrane</h3><p class="First">The concurrent use of tetracycline and Penthrane<span class="Sup">®</span> (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.</p><h3>7.7 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">False elevations of urinary catecholamines may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>8.1 Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects</span><br/></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></span><br/></p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of doxycycline in pregnant women. The vast majority of reported experience with doxycycline during human pregnancy is short-term, first trimester exposure. There are no human data available to assess the effects of long-term therapy of doxycycline in pregnant women such as that proposed for the treatment of anthrax exposure. An expert review of published data on experiences with doxycycline use during pregnancy by TERIS - the Teratogen Information System - concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (the quantity and quality of data were assessed as limited to fair), but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk.<span class="Sup">1</span></p><p>Data<br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>A case-control study (18,515 mothers of infants with congenital anomalies and 32,804 mothers of infants with no congenital anomalies) shows a weak but marginally statistically significant association with total malformations and use of doxycycline anytime during pregnancy. Sixty-three (0.19%) of the controls and 56 (0.30%) of the cases were treated with doxycycline.

Short-term use by lactating women is not necessarily contraindicated. The effects of prolonged exposure to doxycycline in breast milk are unknown<span class="Sup">4</span>. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from doxycycline, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother <span class="Italics">[</span><span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.7)</span><span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>8.4 Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Because of the effects of drugs of the tetracycline-class on tooth development and growth, use doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly, when there are no alternative therapies <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.7) and Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].</span></p><h3>8.5 Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage.</p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Doxycycline Hyclate Delayed-Release Tablets, USP for oral administration, contain specially coated pellets of doxycycline hyclate, USP, a broad-spectrum antibacterial synthetically derived from oxytetracycline, in a delayed-release formulation for oral administration.</p><p>The structural formula for doxycycline hyclate, USP is:</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">22</span>H<span class="Sub">24</span>N<span class="Sub">2</span>O<span class="Sub">8</span> •HCl •½ C<span class="Sub">2</span>H<span class="Sub">6</span>O •½ H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and a molecular weight of 512.9. The chemical designation for doxycycline hyclate, USP is 4-(dimethylamino)-1,4,4α,5,5α,6,11,12α-octahydro- 3,5,10,12,12α-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacencarboxamide monohydrochloride, compound with ethyl alcohol (2:1), monohydrate. Doxycycline hyclate, USP is a yellow crystalline powder soluble in water and in solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates. Doxycycline has a high degree of lipid solubility and a low affinity for calcium binding. It is highly stable in normal human serum. Doxycycline will not degrade into an epianhydro form. Inactive ingredients in the tablet formulation are: crospovidone, D&amp;C Yellow #10 Aluminum Lake, hypromellose 2910, hypromellose phthalate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, talc, and triethyl citrate.</p><p>USP Dissolution test pending.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Doxycycline is an antibacterial drug <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)].</span></p><h3>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Following single and multiple-dose administration of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 200 mg to adult volunteers, average peak plasma doxycycline concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 4.6 mcg/mL and 6.3 mcg/mL, respectively with median t<span class="Sub">max</span> of 3 hours; the corresponding mean plasma concentration values 24 hours after single and multiple doses were 1.5 mcg/mL and 2.3 mcg/mL, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span><br/></p><p>Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration.</p><p><span class="Italics">Effect of Food</span></p><p>The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC <span class="Sub">0-</span><span class="Sub">∞</span> of doxycycline are 24% and 13% lower, respectively, following single dose administration of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 100 mg with a high fat meal (including milk) compared to fasted conditions. The mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> of doxycycline is 19% lower and the AUC <span class="Sub">0-</span><span class="Sub">∞</span> is unchanged following single dose administration of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 150 mg with a high fat meal (including milk) compared to fasted conditions. The clinical significance of these decreases is unknown. Doxycycline bioavailability from doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 200 mg was not affected by food, but the incidence of nausea was higher in fasted subjects. The 200 mg tablets may be administered without regard to meals.</p><p>When doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets are sprinkled over applesauce and taken with or without water, the extent of doxycycline absorption is unchanged, but the rate of absorption is increased slightly.<br/></p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span><br/></p><p>Tetracyclines are concentrated in bile by the liver and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40%/72 hours in individuals with a creatinine clearance of about 75 mL/min. This percentage may fall as low as 1% to 5%/72 hours in individuals with a creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span><br/></p><p><span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</span></p><p>Studies have shown no significant difference in the serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function. Hemodialysis does not alter the serum half-life.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span><br/></p><p>Population pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 children (2 to 18 years of age) showed that allometrically-scaled clearance of doxycycline in children ≥2 to ≤8 years of age (median [range] 3.58 [2.27 to 10.82] L/h/70 kg, N=11) did not differ significantly from children &gt;8 to 18 years of age (3.27 [1.11 to 8.12] L/h/70 kg, N=33). For pediatric patients weighing ≤45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥2 to ≤8 years of age (median [range] 0.071 [0.041 to 0.202] L/kg/h, N=l0) did not differ significantly from those &gt;8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035 to 0.126] L/kg/h, N=8). In pediatric patients weighing &gt;45 kg no clinically significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥2 to ≤8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N=l) and those &gt;8 years of age (0.044 [0.014 to 0. 121] L/kg/h, N=25). No clinically significant difference in CL differences between oral and IV were observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N=l9) or IV (N=21) formulation

Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibacterials, oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors) and minocycline (thyroid tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted, positive results in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibacterials (tetracycline, oxytetracycline).</p><p>Doxycycline administered orally at dosage levels as high as 250 mg/kg/day had no apparent effect on the fertility of female rats. Effect on male fertility has not been studied.</p><h3>13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">Hyperpigmentation of the thyroid has been produced by members of the tetracycline-class in the following species: in rats by oxytetracycline, doxycycline, tetracycline PO<span class="Sub">4</span>, and methacycline; in minipigs by doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline PO<span class="Sub">4</span>, and methacycline; in dogs by doxycycline and minocycline; in monkeys by minocycline.</p><p>Minocycline, tetracycline PO<span class="Sub">4</span>, methacycline, doxycycline, tetracycline base, oxytetracycline HCl, and tetracycline HCl, were goitrogenic in rats fed a low iodine diet. This goitrogenic effect was accompanied by high radioactive iodine uptake. Administration of minocycline also produced a large goiter with high radioiodine uptake in rats fed a relatively high iodine diet.</p><p>Treatment of various animal species with this class of drugs has also resulted in the induction of thyroid hyperplasia in the following: in rats and dogs (minocycline); in chickens (chlortetracycline); and in rats and mice (oxytetracycline). Adrenal gland hyperplasia has been observed in goats and rats treated with oxytetracycline.</p><p>Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues.</p><h2>CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">This was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter trial which enrolled 495 subjects, between 19 to 45 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of urogenital <span class="Italics">C. trachomatis</span> infection less than 14 days prior to enrollment, or partner(s) of a subject with a known positive test for urogenital <span class="Italics">C. trachomatis</span> infection.</p><p>The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets, 200 mg once daily versus doxycycline hyclate capsules, 100 mg twice daily for seven days for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital <span class="Italics">C. trachomatis</span> infection. The primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets 200 mg once daily treatment regimen versus the doxycycline 100 mg twice daily treatment regimen for the indication using a negative nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) at the test of cure visit (day 28) in the mITT population (subjects who were positive at baseline and took at least one day of study drug).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">mITT Population</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Doxycycline Hyclate Delayed-Release Tablets</span><span class="Bold">, 200 mg Once Daily<br/></span> <span class="Bold">Cure Rate<br/>

<li>that no present-day antimalarial agent, including doxycycline, guarantees protection against malaria.</li>
<li>to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using personal protective measures that help avoid contact with mosquitoes, especially from dusk to dawn (for example, staying in well-screened areas, using mosquito nets, covering the body with clothing, and using an effective insect repellent).</li>
<li>that doxycycline prophylaxis:
<ul class="Disc">
<li>should begin 1 to 2 days before travel to the malarious area,</li>
<li>should be continued daily while in the malarious area and after leaving the malarious area,</li>
<li>should be continued for 4 further weeks to avoid development of malaria after returning from an endemic area,</li>
<li>should not exceed 4 months.</li>

</ul><p>All patients taking doxycycline should be advised:</p><ul class="Disk">
<li>to avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (for example, skin eruptions, etc.) occurs. Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></li>
<li>to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></li>
<li>that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with foods, especially those that contain calcium. However, the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)].</span></li>
<li>that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron-containing preparations <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)].</span></li>
<li>that the use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis.</li>
</ul><p>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (for example, the common cold). When doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline hyclate delayed-release tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Brands listed are the trademarks of their respective owners.</p><p><span class="Bold">Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.<br/></span> North Wales, PA 19454</p><p>Rev.
