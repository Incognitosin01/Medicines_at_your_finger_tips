The risk of cardiomyopathy is proportional to the cumulative exposure with incidence rates from 0.9% at a cumulative dose of 550 mg/m(2), 1.6% at 700 mg/m(2), and 3.3% at 900 mg/m(2) and is further increased with concomitant cardiotoxic therapy. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before and regularly during and after treatment with epirubicin. Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome occur at a higher incidence in patients treated with anthracyclines, including epirubicin. Extravasation of epirubicin can result in severe local tissue injury and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. Immediately terminate the drug and apply ice to the affected area. Severe myelosuppression resulting in serious infection, septic shock, requirement for transfusions, hospitalization, and death may occur .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

It interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected, other unwanted effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>This medicine is to be given only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Pharmorubicin Pfs</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving epirubicin injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Pharmorubicin Pfs</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain epirubicin.  It may not be specific to Pharmorubicin Pfs. Please read with care.</b></p><p>Medicines used to treat cancer are very strong and can have many unwanted effects. Before receiving this medicine, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits this medicine will do as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>A doctor or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or cancer treatment center. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.</p><p>This medicine must be given slowly, so the IV tube must remain in place for at least 15 to 20 minutes. It is usually given every 3 to 4 weeks.</p><p>Epirubicin is sometimes given together with other medicines. If you are receiving a combination of medicines, it is important that you receive each one at the proper time. If you are taking some of these medicines by the mouth, ask your doctor to help you plan a way to take them at the right times.</p><p>You may also receive other medicines to help prevent allergic reactions and nausea or vomiting from epirubicin.</p><p>While you are using this medicine, your doctor may want you to drink extra fluids so that you will pass more urine. This will help prevent kidney problems and keep your kidneys working well.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Pharmorubicin Pfs</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman who can bear children, your doctor may give you a pregnancy test before starting this medicine to make sure you are not pregnant. Female patients should use effective birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Male patients who have female partners should use effective birth control during treatment with this medicine and for at least 3 months after the last dose. Male patients with pregnant partners should use condoms during treatment and for at least 7 days after the last dose. If you think you have become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor right away.</p><p>Your doctor may monitor your heart before you start receiving epirubicin and while you are getting treatments with this medicine. Call your doctor right away if you have any chest pain, increased coughing, trouble breathing, a sudden difficulty with breathing at night, rapid weight gain, or abnormal swelling in your ankles or legs. These could be symptoms of serious heart problems.</p><p>This medicine should not be used within 24 weeks of stopping trastuzumab (Herceptin) unless your doctor has determined that it is the best treatment.</p><p>This medicine can rarely cause leukemia (cancer of the blood). Talk with your doctor if you have concerns about this.</p><p>While you are being treated with epirubicin, and after you stop treatment with it, do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval. Epirubicin may lower your body's resistance, and there is a chance you might get the infection the immunization is meant to prevent. In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them, and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.</p><p>Epirubicin can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>If epirubicin accidentally leaks out of the vein into which it is injected, it may damage some tissues and may cause scarring. Tell the doctor right away if you notice redness, pain, or swelling at the injection site.</p><p>This medicine may cause a serious type of reaction called tumor lysis syndrome. Your doctor may give you a medicine to help prevent this. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease or change in urine amount, joint pain, stiffness, or swelling, lower back, side, or stomach pain, a rapid weight gain, swelling of the feet or lower legs, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>This medicine may increase your risk of developing blood clots. If you have chest pain, trouble breathing, or pain, redness, or swelling in your arms or legs while using this medicine, call your doctor right away.</p><p>This medicine may turn your urine red for 1 or 2 days after your treatment. This is normal and is nothing to worry about. You may want to protect your clothing from being stained.</p><p>This medicine often causes a temporary and total loss of hair. After treatment with epirubicin has ended, normal hair growth should return.</p><p>Cancer medicines can cause nausea and vomiting, in most people, sometimes even after receiving medicines to prevent it. Ask your doctor or nurse about other ways to control these unwanted effects if you still have nausea or vomiting after receiving the medicine.</p><p>If you plan to have children, talk with your doctor before using this medicine. Some men and women using this medicine have become infertile (unable to have children).</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Pharmorubicin Pfs side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
