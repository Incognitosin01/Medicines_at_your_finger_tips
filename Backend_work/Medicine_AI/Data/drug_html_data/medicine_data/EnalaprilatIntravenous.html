High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .</p><p>Enalaprilat works by blocking an enzyme in the body that is necessary to produce a substance that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, the blood vessels relax. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart .</p><p>Enalaprilat is available only with your doctor's prescription .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using enalaprilat</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
