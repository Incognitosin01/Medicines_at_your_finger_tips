It is applied to certain areas of the body (for example, the nose, mouth, or throat) to cause loss of feeling or numbness. This allows certain kinds of procedures or surgery to be done without causing pain.</p><p>Cocaine can cause psychological dependence (a strong desire to continue using the medicine because of the "high" feeling it produces). This may lead to cocaine abuse (more frequent use and/or use of larger amounts of cocaine) and to an increased chance of serious side effects. Cocaine abuse has caused death from heart or breathing failure.</p><p>Use of cocaine as a local anesthetic for an examination or surgery is not likely to cause psychological dependence or other serious side effects. However, if cocaine is absorbed into the body too quickly, serious side effects can occur. Also, some people are especially sensitive to the effects of cocaine. Unwanted effects may occur in these people even with small amounts of the medicine. Before receiving cocaine as a local anesthetic, you should discuss its use with your doctor.</p><p>Cocaine is applied only by or under the immediate supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using cocaine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For cocaine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to cocaine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Cocaine can cause serious side effects in any patient. Therefore, it is especially important that you discuss with the child's doctor the good that cocaine may do as well as the risks of using it.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Side effects, including dizziness, lightheadedness, or fast or irregular heartbeats, may be more likely to occur in elderly patients. The elderly are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of cocaine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using cocaine.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using cocaine with any of the following medicines is not recommended.
