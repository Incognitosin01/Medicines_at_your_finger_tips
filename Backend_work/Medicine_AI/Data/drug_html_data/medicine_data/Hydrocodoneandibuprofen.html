Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p><b>Ask a doctor before using this medicine if you are breastfeeding.</b> Tell your doctor if you notice severe drowsiness or slow breathing in the nursing baby.</p><h2>How should I take hydrocodone and ibuprofen?</h2><p>Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use  hydrocodone and ibuprofen in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to take more of this medicine.</p><p><b>Never share this medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH.</b> Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away this medicine is against the law.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Do not keep leftover opioid medication. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush the unused medicine down the toilet.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since hydrocodone and ibuprofen is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>An overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b> Overdose symptoms may include black or bloody stools, coughing up blood, severe drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, slow breathing, or no breathing.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend you get naloxone (a medicine to reverse an opioid overdose) and keep it with you at all times. A person caring for you can give the naloxone if you stop breathing or don't wake up. Your caregiver must still get emergency medical help and may need to perform CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on you while waiting for help to arrive.</p><p>Anyone can buy naloxone from a pharmacy or local health department. Make sure any person caring for you knows where you keep naloxone and how to use it.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid while taking hydrocodone and ibuprofen?</h2><p>Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how  hydrocodone and ibuprofen will affect you. Dizziness or drowsiness can cause falls, accidents, or severe injuries.</p><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur.</p><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using other medicines for pain, fever, swelling, or cold/flu symptoms.
