</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for IDkit Hp</h2><p>13C urea and citric acid are medicines used in a diagnostic test called Exalenz BreathID® non-invasive breath test. It is a test that analyzes a breath sample before and after taking 13C-enriched urea to help diagnose patients with infections in the stomach caused by a bacteria called H. pylori.</p><p>Both of these medicines are taken by the mouth. If any H. pylori bacteria are present in the stomach, they will cause the 13C urea to be broken down into carbon dioxide gas. When you breathe out by the mouth, the amount of carbon dioxide can be measured by Exalenz BreathID® Hp System to detect whether the bacteria are in your stomach.</p><p>These medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using IDkit Hp</h2><p>In deciding to use a diagnostic test, any risks of the test must be weighed against the good it will do.
