Acyclovir is an antiviral agent (treats a virus) and hydrocortisone is a steroid (cortisone-like) medicine.</p><p>Acyclovir and hydrocortisone is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using acyclovir and hydrocortisone</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
