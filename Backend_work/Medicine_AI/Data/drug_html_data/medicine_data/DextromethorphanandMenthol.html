This could result in serotonin syndrome. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors) may increase the serum concentration of Dextromethorphan.  Management: Consider alternatives to this drug combination. If combined, monitor for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome/serotonin toxicity (eg, hyperreflexia, clonus, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tremor, autonomic instability, mental status changes).<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Serotonergic Agents (High Risk): Dextromethorphan may enhance the serotonergic effect of Serotonergic Agents (High Risk). This could result in serotonin syndrome.  Management: Monitor for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome/serotonin toxicity (eg, hyperreflexia, clonus, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tremor, autonomic instability, mental status changes) when these agents are combined.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>See Dextromethorphan monograph.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Self-medication (OTC use): When used for self-medication (OTC) contact health care provider prior to use if you have a persistent or chronic cough associated with asthma, emphysema or smoking, or if you have cough with excess phlegm; notify healthcare provider if symptoms do not improve within 7 days, irritation, pain or redness persist/worsen, swelling develops, or cough is accompanied by fever, rash or persistent headache.</p><p><i><b>Special populations: </b></i></p><p>• CYP2D6 poor metabolizers: Dextromethorphan is metabolized by hepatic CYP2D6. Poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 may have exaggerated or prolonged effects of dextromethorphan. Increased risk may be seen with concomitant use of potent CYP2D6 inhibitors; use with caution (Abduljalil 2010; Jurica 2012; Sager 2014; Zhou 2009).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Refer to individual monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to relieve coughing.</p><p>• It is used to treat a sore throat, sore mouth, or mouth irritation.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
