Nebivolol is a beta-blocker that affects the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins).</p><p>Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Valsartan keeps blood vessels from narrowing, which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow.</p><p>Byvalson is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults. Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack.</p><p>Byvalson is sometimes given together with other blood pressure medications.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Byvalson if you are pregnant.
