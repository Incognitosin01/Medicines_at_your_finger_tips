It belongs to a group of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).

For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of imipramine <i>capsules</i> to treat depression in the pediatric population.

Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Do not start taking imipramine during the 2 weeks after you stop a MAO inhibitor and wait 2 weeks after stopping imipramine before you start taking a MAO inhibitor. If you do take them together or do not wait 2 weeks, you may develop confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, a sudden high body temperature, an extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions.</p><p>Imipramine may cause some teenagers and young adults to be agitated, irritable, or display other abnormal behaviors.
