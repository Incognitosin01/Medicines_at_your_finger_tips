The augmented sunburn reaction involves excitation of the methoxsalen molecule by radiation in the long-wave ultraviolet light (UVA), resulting in transference of energy to the methoxsalen molecule producing an excited state (“triplet electronic state”). The molecule, in this “triplet state,” then reacts with cutaneous DNA.</p><h3>Metabolism</h3><p>Hepatic; forms metabolites</p><h3>Excretion</h3><p>Urine (~95% as metabolites)</p><h3>Time to Peak</h3><p>Hard-gelatin capsules (8-MOP): 1.5 to 6 hours (peak photosensitivity: ~4 hours)</p><p>Soft-gelatin capsules (Oxsoralen Ultra): 0.5 to 4 hours (peak photosensitivity: 1.5 to 2 hours)</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>~2 hours</p><h3>Protein Binding</h3><p>Reversibly bound to albumin</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p>Oral: Symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant disabling psoriasis; repigmentation of idiopathic vitiligo; palliative treatment of skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)</p><p>Extracorporeal: Palliative treatment of skin manifestations of CTCL that is unresponsive to other forms of treatment</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to methoxsalen (psoralens) or any component of the formulation; diseases associated with photosensitivity (eg, albinism, lupus erythematosus, porphyria [cutanea tarda, erythropoietic and variegate], xeroderma pigmentosum); invasive squamous cell cancer (8-MOP and Oxsoralen Ultra only); aphakia; melanoma or history of melanoma (8-MOP and Oxsoralen Ultra only); contraindications to the photopheresis procedure</p><p><i>Canadian labeling (Uvadex):</i> Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Severe cardiac disease; severe anemia; WBC &gt;25,000/mm<sup>3</sup>; previous splenectomy and coagulation disorders; basal cell cancer; coexisting melanoma; squamous cell carcinoma</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Note:</b> Refer to treatment protocols for UVA exposure guidelines.</p><p><b>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL): </b> Extracorporeal (Uvadex): Dose is determined by treatment volume; amount of Uvadex needed for each treatment may be calculated using the following equation: Treatment volume x 0.017 = mL of Uvadex needed.

The use of psoralen and UV radiation therapy should be under constant supervision of such a health care provider. For the treatment of patients with psoriasis, restrict photochemotherapy to patients with severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy, and only when the diagnosis is certain. Because of the possibility of ocular damage, skin aging, and skin cancer (including melanoma), fully inform the patient of the risks inherent in this therapy.</p><p>Injection (photophoresis): Only health care providers who have special competence in the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and have special training and experience in the THERAKOS CELLEX photopheresis system should use methoxsalen. Consult the CELLEX Operator's Manual before using this product.</p><p>Do not use Oxsoralen-Ultra (methoxsalen soft gelatin capsules) interchangeably with 8-MOP (methoxsalen hard gelatin capsules). Oxsoralen-Ultra soft gelatin capsules exhibit significantly greater bioavailability and earlier photosensitization onset time than previous methoxsalen dosage forms. Treat patients in accordance with the dosimetry specifically recommended for this product. Determine the minimum phototoxic dose and phototoxic peak time after drug administration prior to the onset of photochemotherapy with this dosage form.</p><p>8-MOP capsules may not be interchanged with Oxsoralen-Ultra capsules without retitration of the patient.</p><h2>Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Actinic degeneration: Exposure to sunlight and/or ultraviolet radiation may result in premature aging of the skin.</p><p>• Burns: Serious burns may occur from ultraviolet radiation or sunlight (even if exposed through glass) if recommended dose and/or exposure schedule is not maintained. Avoid direct and indirect sunlight for 24 hours after treatment.</p><p>• Cataracts: Methoxsalen concentrates in the lens; eyes should be shielded from direct and indirect sunlight for 24 hours after methoxsalen exposure to prevent possible formation of cataracts.</p><p>• Photosensitivity: Avoid sun (including sun lamp) exposure for 24 hours after methoxsalen ingestion or administration. Protective clothing, eyewear, and sunscreen (do not apply sunscreen to psoriatic areas) should be used for 24 hours after combined methoxsalen/UVA therapy. Do not use in sunburned patients until they have fully recovered; pre-existing sunburn may obscure evaluation of response; advise patients to avoid sunbathing for 24 hours prior to treatment and for 48 hours after treatment. Use extreme caution in patients who have significant exposure to the sun through their occupation.</p><p>• Skin cancer: Therapy may lead to increased risk of skin cancer (basal cell, melanoma and squamous cell); this risk may be increased with fair skin or prior exposure to prolonged tar and UVB treatment, ionizing radiation, or arsenic.</p><p>• Thromboembolic events: Have been reported, including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in patients with graft-versus-host disease (methoxsalen is not FDA-approved for treatment of graft-versus-host disease).</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Basal cell carcinoma: Use with caution in patients with multiple basal cell carcinomas or a history of basal cell carcinoma; observe closely.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (may not be able to tolerate the heat stress or prolonged standing related to UVA treatment conditions).</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Methoxsalen undergoes hepatic metabolism; use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: Safety and efficacy have not been established in children for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) or psoriasis and &lt;12 years of age for vitiligo. The long-term effects of treatment (including potential cataract formation, skin cancer development, and premature skin aging) are unknown in children.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Product interchange: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Soft-gelatin capsule (Oxsoralen-Ultra) and hard-gelatin capsule (8-MOP) are not interchangeable; retitration is required if the formulation is changed.</b> Oxsoralen-Ultra has a greater bioavailability and shorter onset of photosensitization.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: CTCL: For use only if inadequate response to other forms of therapy. Used in conjunction with long wave radiation of white blood cells using the THERAKOS CELLEX photopheresis system.</p><p>• Appropriate use: Psoriasis: For use only if inadequate response to other therapies when the diagnosis is biopsy proven. Administer only in conjunction with scheduled controlled doses of long wave ultraviolet (UVA) radiation (combination referred to as PUVA).</p><p>• Appropriate use: Vitiligo: Used in conjunction with controlled doses of long wave ultraviolet radiation or sunlight.</p><p>• Experienced physician: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Should be administered under the supervision of an experienced physician with special competence in the diagnosis and treatment of dermatologic diseases.</b></p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>CBC with differential (baseline and every 6-12 months), liver and renal function tests (baseline and every 6-12 months), antinuclear antibodies (baseline and every 6-12 months); ophthalmic exam (pretreatment and yearly); signs/symptoms of skin cancer, burns, and photosensitivity</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Adverse events were observed in animal reproduction studies.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat psoriasis.</p><p>• It is used to treat a type of lymphoma that affects the skin.</p><p>• It is used to treat white patches on your skin (vitiligo).</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
