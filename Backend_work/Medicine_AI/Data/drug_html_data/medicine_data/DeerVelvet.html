(North American elk and red deer) and should be removed by a veterinarian or certified farmer. The ethics, including use of local anesthetics, and procedures of harvesting antler velvet have been reported.3, 4, 5, 6 Velvet yield depends on several factors, including season, parasites, or injury.7 After removal of the deer velvet, it is collected and then frozen or dried prior to its manufacture into various "medicinal" forms including powders, extracts, teas, capsules, and tablets. Each part of elk velvet contains varying compounds, but the deer antler velvet contains the largest concentrations of those found to be beneficial. (Antler also has been sold by the slice). Heating during processing may reduce or destroy the purported beneficial effects of velvet antler. Various preparation methods, including freeze-drying and non-heat-producing methods have been reported.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13</p><h2>History</h2><p>The word <i>antler</i> is derived from the Latin <i>Anteoculae</i>, meaning "in front of the eyes." Antlers are present in almost all members of the deer family Cervidae. The first documented evidence of deer velvet as a medicinal was found on a scroll recovered from a tomb in Hunan China dating back 2000 years. The use of antler dates back to the Han Dynasty 206 BC to 220 AD. A 16th century medical text, <i>Pen Ts'ao Kang Mu</i>, lists several antler preparations including pills, tinctures, and ointments. In traditional Chinese medicine, velvet antler has been used for over 2000 years as a tonic, to improve bone health, to nourish the blood, reduce swelling, and to treat impotence. Later research on deer antler dates back to the 1980s in Russia. Hundreds of articles have since been published including those documented by Chinese, Korean, and Japanese scientists.14, 15</p><p>In Chinese medicine, deer velvet has been used to treat impotence, female disorders, urinary problems, skin ailments, and knee weakness. It is also employed as a tonic in children with learning disabilities or insufficient growth.16 Koreans use antler velvet to treat anemia and impotence and to stimulate the immune system, treat impotence, improve heart function, muscle tone, lung efficiency, and nerve function.17</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Reviews of the composition of deer velvet have been published.18, 19 The composition consists of inorganic materials and minerals, polysaccharides, amino acids and other proteins, and lipids and polysaccharides.18, 19</p><p>Of particular pharmacological interest are the constituents collagen and glycosaminoglycan,20, 21 and the prostaglandin content described.22, 23 Epidermal growth factor has been isolated from C. nippon velvet antler.24</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>Very few quality randomized and double-blinde controlled clinical trials exist in the literature.25</p><h3>Arthritis</h3><p>Analysis of antler reveals the presence of cartilaginous tissue containing glycosaminoglycans, particularly chondroitin and lesser amounts of hyaluronic acid.21</p><p>Anti-inflammatory effects have been demonstrated in rats.26 A study in dogs with osteoarthritis compared elk-derived velvet with placebo treatment and reported improved objective and subjective measured outcomes for deer velvet.27</p><p>Data is limited. Two studies (n=40 and 168) investigating the efficacy of elk velvet antler supplementation on rheumatoid arthritis found no effect, while a study conducted in people with osteoarthritis (n=53) reported symptomatic relief among participants. The small sample sizes may result in the trials being underpowered to detect effects.25, 28, 29</p><h3>Performance enhancement</h3><p>In vitro laboratory studies have examined mechanisms by which antlers seasonally regenerate both bone and nerve tissues.30, 31, 32 Expression of neurotropin-3 mRNA in the growing process has been studied.33 Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2) appear to be important mediators for antler growth.34, 35</p><p>Limited studies on the growth promoting effects of deer velvet have been conducted in tadpoles and chicks with equivocal findings.28 A preparation of deer velvet improved induced, whiplash-type injury in rats and rabbits by enhancing glycolysis in nervous tissue.36, 37</p><p>Data is limited.25 Four clinical trials have published findings of deer velvet supplementation on performance, muscle size, and strength; however, the largest of the trials, which enrolled only 46 participants (underpowered), found no effect of supplementation, and only 1 trial (n = 32) found in favour of supplementation.25, 28</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>Older experiments suggest various effects on immune functioning and response to stress,38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and preparations have been shown to stimulate red blood cell synthesis in induced anemia in laboratory animals.44</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Limited studies are available to provide guidance, and standardisation of preparations is lacking. A study in athletes used 1,500 mg deer velvet preparation twice daily.28 In rheumatoid arthritis 1 g daily has been studied.26</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>A possible interaction of velvet antler with morphine has been reported. Velvet antler has inhibited the development of tolerance to repeated doses of morphine in mice. It has been suggested that it may even be useful for prevention and therapy of the adverse actions of morphine.45, 46</p><p>Use caution due to lack of scientific evidence supporting toxicities such as those from drug residues, in pregnancy, or allergic reactions.47</p><p>No direct reports of chronic wasting disease (CWD) related to deer velvet supplementation have been published. However, several Web sites contain disclaimers mentioning the possibility of the disease being present in antler products. The CDC has not yet found a relationship between CWD and any neurological disease that affects humans with deer velvet use.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Toxicity studies of deer antler powder in rats have been assessed. A 2 g/kg dose demonstrated no mortality or adverse events on a short-term (14 days) basis. In a 90-day study, a 1 g/kg/day regimen also found no observable, significant adverse effects, except for a minor change in liver weight.48</p><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
