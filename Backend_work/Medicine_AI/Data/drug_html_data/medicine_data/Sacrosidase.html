Sucrase helps the body breakdown and process certain sugars during digestion. In people who lack the sucrase enzyme, sugar can pass into the intestines where it can interact with bacteria. This can cause bloating, gas, stomach pain, and watery diarrhea.</p><p>Sacrosidase is used to treat sucrase deficiency that occurs in people with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). CSID is a genetic enzyme deficiency and sacrosidase will not cure this condition.</p><p>Do not use sacrosidase to treat any medical condition that has not been checked by your doctor.  sacrosidase is not for use in treating general indigestion or stomach disorders caused by other conditions.</p><p>Sacrosidase may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>This medicine sometimes causes a severe allergic reaction. <b>Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction</b>: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use  sacrosidase if you are allergic to yeast, yeast products, glycerin (glycerol), or papain (Accuzyme, Ethezyme, Gladase, Kovia, and others).</p><p>To make sure sacrosidase is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have diabetes.
