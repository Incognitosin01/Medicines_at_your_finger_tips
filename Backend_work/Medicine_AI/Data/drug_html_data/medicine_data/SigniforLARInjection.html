There have been postmarketing cases of ketoacidosis with SIGNIFOR LAR in patients with history of diabetes and in patients without history of diabetes.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In the acromegalic patient study, 5 patients naïve to drug therapy treated with SIGNIFOR LAR (2 of whom were normoglycemic at baseline) and none in the active comparator group were hospitalized for hyperglycemia (blood glucose range 359-506 mg/dL). Two additional patients who had received active comparator in the main trial and were switched to SIGNIFOR LAR in the extension trial, were hospitalized for elevated glucose levels while on SIGNIFOR LAR; one of those patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis. In the Cushing’s disease study, 2 patients were hospitalized for elevated blood glucose.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">In clinical studies for acromegaly and Cushing’s disease, SIGNIFOR LAR caused an increase in the incidence of diabetes and prediabetes. A majority of patients, including those with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes and diabetes, experienced increased glucose levels within the first 3 months of treatment <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In the drug-naïve acromegaly study, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 30% at baseline to 60% at Month 12. In the study evaluating acromegaly patients previously treated with somatostatin analogs, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 71% at baseline to 87% at Month 6 in patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg, and from 60% to 84% in patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR 60 mg. In the Cushing’s disease study, the prevalence of diabetes increased from 40% at baseline to 56% at Month 12.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Patients with poor baseline glycemic control are at higher risk of developing servere hyperglycemia. Assess FPG and HbA1c prior to starting treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. In patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, optimize anti-diabetic treatment before SIGNIFOR LAR initiation. Monitor blood glucose weekly for the first 3 months after initiating SIGNIFOR LAR and the first 4- to 6 weeks after dose increases. Continue monitoring thereafter, as clinically appropriate.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Patients who develop significant hyperglycemia on SIGNIFOR LAR may require initiation of anti-diabetic treatment or adjustment in their current anti-diabetic treatment. The optimal treatment for the management of SIGNIFOR LAR-induced hyperglycemia is not known. If hyperglycemia cannot be controlled despite medical management, reduce the dose of SIGNIFOR LAR or discontinue SIGNIFOR LAR. Assess FPG and HbA1c after SIGNIFOR LAR discontinuation, if indicated. Patients receiving anti-diabetic treatment may require more frequent blood glucose monitoring and dose adjustment to their anti-diabetic drug therapy to mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia after discontinuing SIGNIFOR LAR.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of diabetes history. In some reported post-marketing cases of ketoacidosis in patients taking SIGNIFOR LAR, factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as acute illness, infection, pancreatic disorders (e.g., pancreatic malignancy or pancreatic surgery), and alcohol abuse were present. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue SIGNIFOR LAR and promptly evaluate and treat the patient.</span></p><h3>Bradycardia and QT Prolongation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Bradycardia</span></p><p>Bradycardia has been reported with the use of SIGNIFOR LAR <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be monitored. Adjustments in the dose of drugs known to slow the heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers) and correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary when initiating or during the course of SIGNIFOR LAR treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">QT Prolongation</span></p><p>In cardiac electrophysiology studies (i.e., thorough QT studies) with pasireotide via subcutaneous route, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p>In the clinical studies, a corrected QT interval (i.e., QTcF) of greater than 480 ms was reported in 6 patients and an increase in the QTcF from baseline of greater than 60 ms was reported for seven patients on SIGNIFOR LAR. No patient on SIGNIFOR LAR had a QTcF value of greater than 500 ms <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span></p><p>SIGNIFOR LAR should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of the QT interval, such as those listed below:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>with congenital long QT prolongation</li>
<li>with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia</li>
<li>on anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances that are known to lead to QT prolongation</li>
<li>with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia</li>
</ul><p>A baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with SIGNIFOR LAR. Monitoring for an effect on the QT interval at the time of maximum drug concentration (21 days after injection) should be obtained in patients at risk. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to initiating SIGNIFOR LAR and should be monitored periodically during therapy.</p><h3>Liver Test Elevations</h3><p class="First">Increases in liver enzymes have been observed with SIGNIFOR LAR. In all Phase 3 acromegaly studies and across all doses, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 4% of acromegaly patients and ALT or AST elevations greater than 5 times the ULN were observed in 1% of acromegaly patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR.</p><p>In the Phase 3 Cushing’s disease study and across all doses, ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the ULN were observed in 14% of Cushing’s disease patients and ALT or AST elevations greater than 5 times the ULN were observed in 5% of Cushing’s disease patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR.</p><p>Assessment of liver function is recommended prior to treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR, and after the first 2- to 3 weeks, then monthly for 3 months. Thereafter, liver function should be monitored as clinically indicated. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels, should be monitored until values return to pre-treatment levels. Treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR should be discontinued if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically significant liver impairment develop. Following discontinuation of treatment with SIGNIFOR LAR, patients should be monitored until resolution. Treatment should not be restarted, if the liver function abnormalities are suspected to be related to SIGNIFOR LAR.</p><h3>Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Cholelithiasis was reported in 33% of drug-naïve and 10% of inadequately controlled (40 mg dose) acromegaly patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR in clinical trials <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span>. Cholelithiasis was reported in 33% of Cushing’s disease patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR. There have been postmarketing reports of cholelithiasis (gallstones) resulting in complications, including cholecystitis or cholangitis and requiring cholecystectomy in patients taking SIGNIFOR LAR. Patients should be monitored periodically. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue SIGNIFOR LAR and treat appropriately.</span></p><h3>Pituitary Hormone Deficiency(ies)</h3><p class="First">Suppression of anterior pituitary hormones may occur on SIGNIFOR LAR. Monitoring pituitary function (e.g., thyroid, adrenal, gonadal) prior to initiation of therapy with SIGNIFOR LAR, as well as periodically during treatment, as clinically appropriate, is recommended. Patients should be monitored for and instructed on the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during therapy. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, it should be confirmed and treated per standard of care with exogenous glucocorticoids at replacement doses.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include:</p><ul class="Disc">

In the drug-naïve study, 2 acromegaly patients receiving SIGNIFOR LAR developed pancreatitis. In the Cushing’s disease study, increased lipase was observed in 4% of patients, and 1 patient developed pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of SIGNIFOR LAR due to the association between cholelithiasis and acute pancreatitis.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SIGNIFOR LAR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul>
<li>Cholelithiasis resulting in complications, including cholecystitis and cholangitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy</li>
</ul><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on SIGNIFOR LAR</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drugs That Prolong QT</span></p><p>Coadministration of drugs that prolong the QT interval with SIGNIFOR LAR may have additive effects on the prolongation of the QT interval. Monitoring effects on the QT interval at 21 days is recommended <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Effect of SIGNIFOR LAR on Other Drugs</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cyclosporine</span></p><p>Concomitant administration of cyclosporine with SIGNIFOR LAR may decrease the relative bioavailability of cyclosporine and, therefore, dose adjustment of cyclosporine to maintain therapeutic levels may be necessary.</p><p><span class="Bold">Bromocriptine</span></p><p>Co-administration of SIGNIFOR LAR with bromocriptine may increase the blood levels of bromocriptine. Dose reduction of bromocriptine may be necessary.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The limited data with SIGNIFOR LAR in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. In embryo-fetal development studies in rabbits, findings indicating a developmental delay were observed with subcutaneous administration of pasireotide during organogenesis at doses less than the exposure in humans at the highest recommended dose; maternal toxicity was not observed at this dose <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In embryo-fetal development studies in rats given 1 mg/kg/day, 5 mg/kg/day, and 10 mg/kg/day subcutaneously throughout organogenesis, maternal toxicity was observed at all doses, including the lowest dose tested which had exposures 12 times higher than that at the maximum therapeutic dose based on area under the curve (AUC) comparisons across species. An increased incidence of early/total resorptions and malrotated limbs was observed in rats at 10 mg/kg/day. At 10 mg/kg/day in rats, the maternal systemic exposure (AUC) was 42179 ng*hr/mL, approximately 106 times the exposure in humans at the highest recommended dose of 60 mg SIGNIFOR LAR administered as an intramuscular injection once every 4 weeks.</p><p>In embryo-fetal development studies in rabbits given 0.05 mg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day, and 5 mg/kg/day subcutaneously through organogenesis, maternal toxicity was observed at 1 mg/kg/day, at a maternal systemic exposure (AUC) of 1906 ng*hr/mL, approximately 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure. An increased incidence of unossified forepaw phalanx, indicative of a developmental retardation, was observed in rabbits at 0.05 mg/kg/day, with maternal systemic exposures less than the systemic exposure in humans at the highest recommended dose.</p><p>In pre- and post-natal developmental studies in rats given subcutaneous doses of 2 mg/kg/day, 5 mg/kg/day, and 10 mg/kg/day during gestation through lactation and weaning, maternal toxicity was observed at all doses including the lowest dose (9 times higher than the maximum therapeutic dose based on surface area comparisons across species). Retardation of physiological growth, attributed to GH inhibition was observed at 2 mg/kg/day during a pre- and post-natal study in rats. After weaning, body weight gains in the rat pups (F1 generation) exposed to pasireotide were comparable to controls, showing reversibility of this developmental delay.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information available on the presence of SIGNIFOR LAR in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies show that pasireotide administered subcutaneously passes into the milk of lactating rats; however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for SIGNIFOR LAR, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SIGNIFOR LAR or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Available data in animals have shown excretion of pasireotide in milk. After a single 1 mg/kg [ <span class="Sup">14</span>C]-pasireotide subcutaneous dose to lactating rats, the transfer of radioactivity into milk was observed. The overall milk:plasma (M/P) exposure ratio of total radioactivity was 0.28, based on AUC <span class="Sub">0-∞</span> values.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as the therapeutic benefits of a reduction in GH levels and normalization of IGF-1 in acromegalic females treated with pasireotide may lead to improved fertility.</p><p>Similarly, the therapeutic benefits of a reduction or normalization of serum cortisol levels in female patients with Cushing’s disease treated with pasireotide may also lead to improved fertility.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of SIGNIFOR LAR have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of SIGNIFOR LAR did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh A), but is required for patients with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh B). The safety and efficacy of SIGNIFOR LAR have not been established in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). No dosage recommendation can be given for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of SIGNIFOR LAR in patients with renal impairment have not been conducted. On the basis of studies with pasireotide given subcutaneously, dosage adjustment is not needed in patients with renal impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">In the event of overdosage, it is recommended that appropriate supportive treatment be initiated, as dictated by the patient’s clinical status, until resolution of the symptoms.</p><p>Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose can be obtained from a certified Regional Poison Center. In the event of an overdose, contact the National Capital Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org.</p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">SIGNIFOR LAR (pasireotide) for injectable suspension is a long-acting release form of pasireotide pamoate, as powder to be suspended in the provided diluent immediately prior to intramuscular injection. SIGNIFOR LAR contains pasireotide, a somatostatin analog in the form of pasireotide pamoate (pamoic acid salt). Pasireotide is a cyclohexapeptide with pharmacologic properties mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Pasireotide pamoate has a chemical name of (2-Aminoethyl) carbamic acid (2R,5S,8S,11S,14R,17S,19aS)-11-(4-aminobutyl)-5-benzyl-8-(4-benzyloxybenzyl)-14-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaoxo-17-phenyloctadecahydro-3a,6,9,12,15,18-hexaazacyclopentacyclooctadecen-2-yl ester pamoic acid salt.</p><p>The molecular formula of pasireotide pamoate is C <span class="Sub">58</span>H <span class="Sub">66</span>N <span class="Sub">10</span>O <span class="Sub">9</span> • C <span class="Sub">23</span>H <span class="Sub">16</span>O <span class="Sub">6</span> and the molecular weight is 1435.58 g/mol.</p><p>The structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>The drug product consists of pasireotide pamoate uniformly distributed within microspheres which are made of biodegradable copolymers of poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) acids (PLGA).</p><p>SIGNIFOR LAR is available in a vial containing the sterile pasireotide pamoate, PLGA microspheres powder, 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg to be reconstituted with the provided 2 mL sterile diluent.</p><p>Each vial contains:</p><p>Each diluent prefilled syringe contains:</p><h2>Signifor LAR Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">SIGNIFOR LAR is an injectable cyclohexapeptide, somatostatin analog. Pasireotide exerts its pharmacological activity via binding to somatostatin receptors (SSTR). There are 5 known human somatostatin receptor subtypes: SSTR 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. These receptor subtypes are expressed in different tissues under normal physiological conditions. Somatostatin analogs bind to SSTRs with different potencies. Pasireotide binds with high affinity to 4 of the 5 SSTRs (see Table 4).</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Somatostatin receptors are expressed in many tissues including neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., growth hormone or adrenocorticotropic hormone secreting pituitary adenomas).</p><p><span class="Italics">Acromegaly</span></p><p>Pasireotide binds to SSTR2 and SSTR5 subtype receptors which may be relevant for inhibition of GH secretion. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> studies show that SIGNIFOR LAR lowers GH and IGF-1 levels in patients with acromegaly.</p><p><span class="Italics">Cushing’s Disease</span></p><p>Corticotroph tumor cells from Cushing’s disease patients frequently over-express SSTR5 whereas the other receptor subtypes are often not expressed or are expressed at lower levels. Pasireotide binds and activates the SSTRs resulting in inhibition of ACTH secretion, which leads to decreased cortisol secretion.</p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology</span></p><p>Individually corrected QT (QTcI) interval was evaluated in a randomized, blinded, crossover study in healthy subjects investigating pasireotide subcutaneous doses of 0.6 mg and 1.95 mg twice daily, respectively. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) placebo-subtracted QTcI change from baseline was 12.7 (14.7) ms and 16.6 (18.6) ms, respectively. Both pasireotide doses decreased heart rate, with a maximum mean (95% lower confidence bound) placebo-subtracted change from baseline of -10.9 (-11.9) beats per minute (bpm) observed at 1.5 hours for pasireotide 0.6 mg twice daily, and -15.2 (-16.5) bpm at 0.5 hours for pasireotide 1.95 mg twice daily.</p><p>The predicted pasireotide peak concentration (25.8 ng/mL) following SIGNIFOR LAR 60-mg dose in acromegaly patients is similar to the observed peak concentration (24.3 mg/mL) of the subcutaneous SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg twice daily dose and below the observed peak concentration (80.6 ng/mL) of the subcutaneous SIGNIFOR 1.95 mg twice daily dose. The predicted pasireotide peak concentration for the SIGNIFOR LAR dose of 40 mg in Cushing’s disease patients is 14 ng/mL.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Pasireotide for intramuscular use is formulated as microspheres for long-acting release. After a single injection, the plasma pasireotide concentration shows an initial burst release on the injection day, followed by a dip from Day 2 to Day 7, then a slow increase to the maximum concentration around Day 21, and a slow declining phase over the next weeks, concomitant with the terminal degradation phase of the polymer matrix of the dosage form.</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption and Distribution</span></p><p>No studies have been conducted to evaluate the absolute bioavailability of pasireotide in humans. Food effect is unlikely to occur since SIGNIFOR LAR is administered via a parenteral route.</p><p>In healthy volunteers, pasireotide administered as SIGNIFOR LAR is widely distributed with large apparent volume of distribution (V <span class="Sub">z</span>/F &gt; 100 L). Distribution between blood and plasma is concentration-independent and shows that pasireotide is primarily located in the plasma (91%). Plasma protein binding is moderate (88%) and independent of concentration.</p><p>Pasireotide has low passive permeability and is likely to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but the impact of P-gp on the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) of pasireotide is expected to be low. In clinical testing in healthy volunteers, P-gp inhibition did not affect the rate or extent of pasireotide availability <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>. At therapeutic dose levels, pasireotide is not expected to be a substrate of BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein), OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1), or OATP (organic anion-transporting polypeptides) 1B1, 1B3, or 2B1.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism and Excretion</span></p><p>Pasireotide was shown to be highly metabolically stable in human liver and kidney microsomes. In healthy volunteers, pasireotide in its unchanged form is the predominant form found in plasma, urine and feces. Somatropin may increase CYP450 enzymes and, therefore, suppression of GH secretion by somatostatin analogs including pasireotide may decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.</p><p>Pasireotide is eliminated mainly via hepatic clearance (biliary excretion) with a small contribution of the renal route. In a human ADME study with subcutaneous SIGNIFOR with a single dose 0.6 mg, 55.9 ± 6.63% of the radioactivity dose was recovered over the first 10 days post dosing, including 48.3 ± 8.16% of the radioactivity in feces and 7.63 ± 2.03% in urine.</p><p>The apparent clearance (CL/F) of SIGNIFOR LAR in healthy volunteers is on average 4.5-8.5 L/hour.</p><p><span class="Bold">Steady-State Pharmacokinetics</span></p><p>PK steady-state for SIGNIFOR LAR is achieved after 3 monthly doses. Following multiple intramuscular doses every 4 weeks (every 28 days), SIGNIFOR LAR demonstrates approximately dose-proportional PK exposures (steady-state trough; Ctrough, ss) in the dose range of 10 mg to 60 mg every 4 weeks.</p><p><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p>Population PK analyses of SIGNIFOR LAR suggest that race, gender, and body weight do not have clinically relevant influence on circulating levels of pasireotide. No dose adjustment is required for demographics.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patients</span></span></p><p>No studies have been performed in pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients</span></span></p><p>Age is not a significant covariate in the population PK analysis. Therefore age is not expected to significantly impact circulating levels of pasireotide.</p><p>Efficacy and safety data on patients older than 65 years are limited <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></span></p><p>In a clinical study with a single subcutaneous dose of 600 µg pasireotide in subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh A, B, and C), subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C) showed significantly higher exposures than subjects with normal hepatic function. Upon comparing with the control group, AUC <span class="Sub">inf</span> was increased by 12%, 56%, and 42%; and C <span class="Sub">max</span> was increased by 3%, 46%, and 33% respectively, in the mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment groups <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></span></p><p>Clinical studies have not been performed in patients with renal impairment. However, renal clearance has a minor contribution to the elimination of pasireotide in humans. Renal function (creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate) is not a covariate in the population PK analysis. Therefore, renal function is not expected to significantly impact the circulating levels of pasireotide <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]</span>.</p><h2>NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>A lifetime carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats and transgenic mice. Rats were given daily subcutaneous doses of pasireotide at 0.01 mg/kg/day, 0.05 mg/kg/day, and 0.3 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks. There were no drug-related tumors in rats at exposures up to 5-times higher than the maximum recommended clinical exposure of the pasireotide LAR 60 mg dose. Mice were given subcutaneous doses of pasireotide at 0.5 mg/kg/day, 1 mg/kg/day, and 2.5 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks and did not identify any carcinogenic potential.</p><p><span class="Italics">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Pasireotide was not genotoxic in a battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays (Ames mutation test in <span class="Italics">Salmonella</span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span> and mutation test in human peripheral lymphocytes). Pasireotide was not genotoxic in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat bone marrow nucleus test.</p><p><span class="Italics">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Subcutaneous dosing at 0.1 mg/kg/day before mating and continuing into gestation in rats at exposures less than the human clinical exposure based on body surface area comparisons across species resulted in statistically significant increased implantation loss and decreased viable fetuses, corpora lutea, and implantation sites. Abnormal cycles or acyclicity were observed at 1 mg/kg/day (4-fold higher than the maximum therapeutic exposure of pasireotide LAR based on surface area, comparisons across species).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Drug Naive Patients with Acromegaly</h3><p class="First">A multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of SIGNIFOR LAR in patients with active acromegaly. A total of 358 patients naïve to drugs used to treat acromegaly were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to SIGNIFOR LAR or another somatostatin analog active comparator. Randomization was stratified based on previous pituitary surgical status (e.g., at least 1 prior pituitary surgery versus no prior pituitary surgery).</p><p>In the overall study population, 52% were female and the average age of patients was 45 years. Sixty percent of patients were Caucasian, 23% Asian, 12% Other, 3% American Indian, and 2% were Black. Forty-two percent of patients had previous pituitary surgery, and 1 patient had a history of pituitary radiation therapy. Median time between diagnosis and trial participation was 6 months. Median GH was 8.8 mcg/L (range: 0.8-200 mcg/L) and 10.1 mcg/L (range: 0.6–169.6 mcg/L) for SIGNIFOR LAR and active comparator, respectively at baseline. Median standardized IGF-1, defined as IGF-1 value divided by the ULN (i.e., fold above the ULN), was 2.9 (range: 0.9–6.9) and 2.9 (range: 0.8–7.3), for SIGNIFOR LAR and active comparator, respectively, at baseline.</p><p>The starting dose of SIGNIFOR LAR was 40 mg. Dose increase was allowed in both arms, at the discretion of investigators, after 3 and 6 months of treatment if mean GH was greater than or equal to 2.5 mcg/L and/or IGF-1 was greater than the ULN for age and sex. The maximum allowed dose for SIGNIFOR LAR was 60 mg. The maximum dose of the active comparator was not used in this trial because the trial was multi-national and the maximum dose approved in the US was not approved in all participating countries.</p><p>The efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a mean GH level less than 2.5 mcg/L and a normal IGF-1 levels at month 12 (age- and sex-adjusted) (see Table 5, Figure 3, and Figure 4). The proportion of patients achieving this level of control was 31.3% and 19.2% for SIGNIFOR LAR and active comparator, respectively. The changes in mean GH and IGF-1 levels by study visits in subjects with a measurement at these visits (observed cases) are shown in Figures 3 and 4.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SIGNIFOR LAR</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(40-60 mg)</span></p><p><span class="Bold">%</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 176</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Active Comparator <span class="Sup">c</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">%</span></p><p><span class="Bold">N = 182</span></p><p class="First">ULN = Upper limit of normal.</p><p><span class="Sup">b</span>p-value &lt; 0.01 for treatment difference.</p><p><span class="Sup">c</span>The maximum dose approved for use in the United States was not used in this trial but the majority of patients were receiving the dose most commonly used in the United States to treat acromegaly.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Figure 3.

Ninety-eight percent of patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR had either a reduction or no change in tumor volume from baseline assessed by MRI at Month 12. The median (range) change in tumor volume was a reduction of 39.8% (-97.6% to 16.9%).</p><p>Additionally, ring size and acromegaly symptoms score (i.e., headache, fatigue, perspiration, paresthesia, and osteoarthralgia) were followed. At Month 12, reductions in ring size and in symptom severity scores in both treatment groups compared to baseline were noted.</p><h3>Patients with Acromegaly Inadequately Controlled on Other Somatostatin Analogs</h3><p class="First">A multicenter, randomized, 3-arm study was conducted in patients with acromegaly inadequately controlled on somatostatin analogs. Patients were randomized to double-blind SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg (n = 65) or SIGNIFOR LAR 60 mg (n = 65) or to continued open-label pretrial somatostatin analog therapies at maximal or near maximal doses (n = 68). A total of 181 patients completed the 6-month trial.</p><p>Inadequate control was defined as a GH concentration of greater than 2.5 mcg/L (i.e., mean of 5 samples over 2 hours) and a sex- and age-adjusted IGF-1 level greater than 1.3 times the upper limit of normal. Patients were required to have been treated with other somatostatin analogs for at least 6 months prior to randomization. Note that the maximum dose for one of the active comparators approved for use in the United States was not used in this multinational trial; approximately 75% of the population in the comparator group was receiving this active comparator.</p><p>In the overall study population, 56% were female and the average age of patients was 45 years. Eighty-one percent of patients were Caucasian, 7% Other, 8% Black, 2% American Indian, and 2% Asian. The percentage of patients with previous pituitary surgery in the SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg and 60 mg arms, and in the active control arm was 77%, 63%, and 60%, respectively. Three percent of patients in the SIGNIFOR LAR groups and 7% of patients in the active control arm had prior radiation therapy. Median (range) time from diagnosis to participation in this trial was 50 (10–337) months, 55 (8–357) months, and 54 (8–357) months in the SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg, 60 mg and the pretrial therapy arms, respectively. At baseline, median (range) GH was 7.1 (1.0–200) mcg/L, 5.3 (1.4–113.8) mcg/L and 6.1 (1.0–92.4) mcg/L in the SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg, 60 mg and the pretrial therapy arms, respectively. Baseline median standardized IGF-1 (defined as IGF-1 value divided by the ULN) values were 2.3, 2.6 and 2.9 in the SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg, 60 mg and the pretrial therapy arms, respectively.</p><p>The efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a mean GH level less than 2.5 mcg/L and normal IGF-1 levels at week 24. The primary analysis compared SIGNIFOR LAR 60 mg and 40 mg to continued pretrial therapy (i.e., no change in treatment). The proportion of patients achieving biochemical control was 15.4% and 20.0% for SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg and 60 mg, respectively, at 6 months.</p><p>Biochemical control was achieved by Month 3 in 15.4% and 18.5% of patients in the SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg and 60 mg arms, respectively.</p><p>Eighty-one percent and 70% of patients treated with SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg and 60 mg, respectively, had either a reduction or no change in tumor volume from baseline assessed by MRI at Month 6. The median (range) change in tumor volume was a reduction of -10.4% (-74.5% to 19.4%) and -6.3% (-66.7% to 14.5%) from baseline for SIGNIFOR LAR 40 mg and 60 mg, respectively.</p><h3>Patients with Cushing’s Disease</h3><p class="First">A Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of SIGNIFOR LAR over a 12-month treatment period in patients with persistent or recurrent Cushing’s disease, or <span class="Italics">de novo</span> patients who were not considered candidates for pituitary surgery.</p><p>The study enrolled 150 patients with a screening mean urinary free cortisol level (mUFC) ≥ 1.5 and ≤ 5 x ULN, who were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a SIGNIFOR LAR starting dose of either 10 mg intramuscularly once every 28 days or 30 mg intramuscularly once every 28 days. Randomization was stratified by values of mUFC at screening (1.5 to &lt; 2 x ULN versus 2 to 5 x ULN, respectively).</p><p>After four months of treatment, patients who had a mUFC ≤ 1.5 x ULN continued on the blinded dose to which they were randomized. Patients with a mUFC &gt; 1.5 x ULN at Month 4 had their doses increased in a blinded manner from 10 mg to 30 mg, or from 30 mg to 40 mg, provided there were no tolerability concerns. Additional dose increases were allowed at Month 7 and Month 9 (by one dose level if the mUFC was &gt; 1 x ULN).</p><p>Dose reduction by one dose level for tolerability was allowed in a blinded fashion for the first seven months, with a minimum dose level of 5 mg. After the first seven months, blinded down titration of more than one dose level was allowed at any month.</p><p>After twelve months of treatment (core phase), patients had the option to enter an extension to continue to receive SIGNIFOR LAR if they benefited from treatment.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in each arm who were mUFC responders (mUFC ≤ ULN) after seven months of treatment, with or without up-titration at Month 4. The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients in each arm who were mUFC responders after seven months of treatment and who did not up-titrate the dose prior to Month 7. The pre-specified boundary of the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for efficacy for both the primary and key secondary endpoints was 15%. Patients with missing mUFC assessment at Month 7 were classified as non-responders. Other secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in 24-hour UFC, plasma ACTH, and serum cortisol levels. All analyses were conducted based on the randomized dose groups.</p><p>Baseline demographics and disease history were well balanced between the two randomized dose groups and consistent with the epidemiology of the disease. The mean age of patients was approximately 38.5 years with a predominance of female patients (78.7%). The majority of the patients had persistent or recurrent Cushing’s disease (82.0%). The median value of the baseline 24-hour mUFC for all patients was 396.9 nmol/24 hours (ULN: 166.5 nmol/24 hours). About three-quarters of all randomized patients completed seven months of treatment, and about two-thirds of all randomized patients completed twelve months of treatment.</p><p>The study met the primary efficacy objective for both dose groups. Patients were considered responders if they remained on treatment until at least Month 7 and achieved a Month 7 mUFC ≤ 1 x ULN, regardless of up-titration at Month 4. The proportion of patients with mUFC response at Month 7 was 39.2% (95% CI: 28.0, 51.2) in the 10 mg arm and 40.8% (95% CI: 29.7, 52.7) in the 30 mg arm. The responder rate at Month 12 was 35.1% (26/74) and 25.0% (19/76) in the 10 mg and 30 mg starting dose groups, respectively.</p><p>The study met the key secondary efficacy objective for both dose groups. At Month 4, 31/74 (41.9%) and 28/76 (36.8%) patients were up-titrated in the pasireotide LAR 10 mg and 30 mg arms, respectively. When all patients who up-titrated prior to Month 7 were counted as non-responders, Month 7 mUFC response was observed in 25.7% (95% CI: 16.2 to 37.2) and 31.6% (95% CI: 21.4 to 43.3) of patients randomized to pasireotide LAR at a starting dose of 10 mg once every 28 days and 30 mg once every 28 days, respectively.</p><p>A secondary efficacy analysis was conducted for the combined proportion of patients who attained mUFC ≤ ULN (controlled) or had at least 50% reduction in mUFC (partially controlled) in the core phase of the study. The combined rate of controlled or partially controlled responders at Month 7 constituted 44.6% and 53.9% of patients randomized to the 10 mg and 30 mg dose groups, respectively (Table 8).</p><p>Decreases in median mUFC levels at Month 7 compared to baseline, as measured by overall percentage of reduction, are shown in Table 9. Reductions in serum cortisol and plasma ACTH levels were also observed at Months 7 and 12 for each dose group.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">SIGNIFOR LAR for injectable suspension is supplied in a single-use kit containing the following:</p><ul>
