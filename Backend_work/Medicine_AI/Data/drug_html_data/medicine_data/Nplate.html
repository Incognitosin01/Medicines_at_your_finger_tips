The effectiveness of Nplate for this use was only studied in animals, because it could not be studied in people.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Nplate is not a cure for ITP and it will not make your platelet counts normal if you have this condition.</p><p>Nplate may increase your risk of a blood clot or stroke. <b>Call your doctor right away if you have signs of a blood clot,</b> such as sudden numbness or weakness on one side of the body, chest pain, problems with speech or balance, warmth or swelling in an arm or leg.</p><p>Before you use Nplate, tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver disease.</p><p>Using Nplate long-term can cause harmful effects on your bone marrow that may result in serious blood cell disorders.
