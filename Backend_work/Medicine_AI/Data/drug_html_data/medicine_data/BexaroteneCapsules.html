</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Bexarotene Capsules are a member of the retinoid class of drugs that is associated with birth defects in humans. Bexarotene also caused birth defects when administered orally to pregnant rats. Bexarotene Capsules must not be administered to a pregnant woman. (8.1)</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Bexarotene Capsules</h2><p class="First">Bexarotene Capsules are indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy.</p><h2>Bexarotene Capsules Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">The recommended initial dose of Bexarotene Capsules is 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day (see Table 1). Bexarotene Capsules should be taken as a single oral daily dose with a meal. For precautions to prevent pregnancy and birth defects in women of child-bearing potential [<span class="Italics">see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Initial Dose Level (300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Number of 75 mg Bexarotene Capsules</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Body Surface Area</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(m<span class="Sup">2</span>)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Total Daily Dose</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(mg/day)</span></p><p class="First">0.88 – 1.12</p><p class="First">300</p><p class="First">4</p><p class="First">1.13 – 1.37</p><p class="First">375</p><p class="First">5</p><p class="First">1.38 – 1.62</p><p class="First">450</p><p class="First">6</p><p class="First">1.63 – 1.87</p><p class="First">525</p><p class="First">7</p><p class="First">1.88 – 2.12</p><p class="First">600</p><p class="First">8</p><p class="First">2.13 – 2.37</p><p class="First">675</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">2.38 – 2.62</p><p class="First">750</p><p class="First">10</p><p>Dose Modification Guidelines: The 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day dose level of Bexarotene Capsules may be adjusted to 200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day then to 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, or temporarily suspended, if necessitated by toxicity. When toxicity is controlled, doses may be carefully readjusted upward. If there is no tumor response after eight weeks of treatment and if the initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day is well tolerated, the dose may be escalated to 400 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day with careful monitoring.</p><p>Duration of Therapy: In clinical trials in CTCL, Bexarotene Capsules was administered for up to 97 weeks.</p><p>Bexarotene Capsules should be continued as long as the patient is deriving benefit.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Capsules: 75 mg, oblong white to off-white opaque colored capsule filled with white to off-white colored liquid printed with “546” in black ink across one side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Bexarotene Capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Bexarotene Capsules are a member of the retinoid class of drugs that is associated with birth defects in humans and is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Bexarotene was also teratogenic and caused developmental mortality when administered orally to pregnant rats. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be advised of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity</h3><p class="First">Bexarotene Capsules are contraindicated in patients with a known serious hypersensitivity to bexarotene or other components of the product.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hyperlipidemia</h3><p class="First">Bexarotene Capsules induces substantial elevations in lipids in most patients. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of <span class="Bold">&gt;</span>300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1200 mg/dL in those patients. Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day or greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, respectively, of Bexarotene Capsules. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy.</p><p>Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before Bexarotene Capsules therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to Bexarotene Capsules is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight-week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating Bexarotene Capsules therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>]. If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of Bexarotene Capsules. In the 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with Bexarotene Capsules [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with Bexarotene Capsules; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt Bexarotene Capsules and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with Bexarotene Capsules [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure</h3><p class="First">Bexarotene Capsules caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue Bexarotene Capsules if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin.</p><h3>Hypothyroidism</h3><p class="First">Bexarotene Capsules induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and patients monitor during treatment.</p><h3>Neutropenia</h3><p class="First">Leukopenia in the range of 1000 to &lt;3000 WBC x 10<span class="Sup">6</span>/L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules. Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with Bexarotene Capsules developed leukopenia of less than 1000 WBC x 10<span class="Sup">6</span>/L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating Bexarotene Capsules. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominately neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during Bexarotene Capsules therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment.</p><h3>Cataracts</h3><p class="First">Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of Bexarotene Capsules and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with Bexarotene Capsules who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation.</p><h3>Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard</h3><p class="First">In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to <span class="Bold">&lt;</span>15,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects.</p><h3>Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus</h3><p class="First">In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, Bexarotene Capsules could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of Bexarotene Capsules as monotherapy.</p><h3>Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First">Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving Bexarotene Capsules. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving Bexarotene Capsules.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Before initiating Bexarotene Capsules therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during Bexarotene Capsules therapy as described above.</p><p>Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><p>A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [<span class="Italics">see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by Bexarotene Capsules therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of Bexarotene Capsules has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received Bexarotene Capsules for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day (see Table 2).</p><p>Adverse reactions leading to Bexarotene Capsules dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion.</p><p>The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.</p><p>In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3.</p><p>In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received Bexarotene Capsules as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day to 1000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL.</p><p>In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received Bexarotene Capsules as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure.</p><p>In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2-4 or discussed in other parts of

Bexarotene was teratogenic and caused developmental mortality in rats following oral administration during organogenesis <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Bexarotene Capsules must not be given to a pregnant female or a female who intends to become pregnant. If pregnancy does occur during treatment with Bexarotene Capsules, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2-4% and of miscarriage is 15-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Italics">Data</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Animal Data</span>: Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7-17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There is no information regarding the presence of Bexarotene Capsules in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production.

Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when Bexarotene Capsules are used. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives [<span class="Italics">see Drug Interactions (7)</span>]. Thus, if treatment with Bexarotene Capsules is intended in a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Bexarotene Capsules therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one-month supply of Bexarotene Capsules should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced.</p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Males</span></span>: Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking Bexarotene Capsules and for at least one month after the last dose of drug.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness of Bexarotene Capsules in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical trials of Bexarotene Capsules, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to Bexarotene Capsules cannot be ruled out. Responses to Bexarotene Capsules were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No specific studies have been conducted with Bexarotene Capsules in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to lead to decreased clearance [<span class="Italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>]. If Bexarotene Capsules are used in patients with hepatic impairment, monitor for signs of toxicity that may be due to increased exposure.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Doses up to 1000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules have been administered in short-term trials in patients with advanced cancer without acute toxic effects. Single doses of 1500 mg/kg and 720 mg/kg were tolerated without significant toxicity in rats and dogs, respectively. These doses are approximately 30 and 50 times, respectively, the recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis.</p><h2>Bexarotene Capsules Description</h2><p class="First">BexaroteneCapsules contain bexarotene, a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs).</p><p>The chemical name of bexarotene is 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl)ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows:</p><p>Bexarotene is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of C<span class="Sub">24</span>H<span class="Sub">28</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>. It is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol.</p><p>Each Bexarotene Capsule contains 75 mg of bexarotene for oral administration. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxyanisole, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate and povidone. The capsule shell contains black ink, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, sorbitol, sorbitan, mannitol and titanium dioxide. The black ink contains ferrosoferric oxide, hypromellose, and propylene glycol.</p><h2>Bexarotene Capsules - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXRα, RXRß, RXRᵞ). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Terminal half-life of bexarotene is approximately seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range.</p><p><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></p><p>After oral administration of Bexarotene Capsules, bexarotene is absorbed with a T<span class="Sub">max</span> of about two hours. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution.</p><p><span class="Italics">Distribution</span></p><p>Bexarotene is highly bound (&gt;99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied</p><p><span class="Italics">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span>: Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of Bexarotene Capsules is unknown.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion</span><span class="Italics">:</span> The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (&lt;1% of administered dose).</p><p><span class="Italics">Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Age</span>: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged <span class="Bold">&gt;</span>65 years and 343 patients aged &lt;65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics.</p><p><span class="Bold">Body Weight and Gender</span>: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics.</p><p><span class="Bold">Race</span>: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span>: No formal studies have been conducted with Bexarotene Capsules in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (&lt;1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span>: No specific studies have been conducted with Bexarotene Capsules in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance.</p><p><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene Capsules</span>: <span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers:</span></span> In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with Bexarotene Capsules did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations.

Bexarotene is not mutagenic to bacteria (Ames assay) or mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma assay). Bexarotene was not clastogenic <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (micronucleus test in mice).</p><p>No formal fertility studies were conducted with bexarotene. Bexarotene caused testicular degeneration when oral doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day were given to dogs for 91 days (producing an AUC of approximately one fifth the AUC at the recommended human daily dose).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">Bexarotene Capsules were evaluated in two clinical trials in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia.</p><p>The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical).</p><p>The two clinical trials enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom Bexarotene Capsules is indicated.</p><p>Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day of Bexarotene Capsules showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day.</p><p>Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations.</p><p>All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy.</p><p>At the initial dose of 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits.</p><p>In one post-approval clinical trial with a total of 59 subjects (29 in 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day dose group and 30 in the 150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day dose), the objective response rate was higher in the Bexarotene Capsules 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day group than in the Bexarotene Capsules 150 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day group with respect to the CA (34.5% vs 23.3%), Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) (37.9% vs 20.0%), and percent BSA involvement (34.5% vs 23.3%).</p><p>The median duration of response in the Bexarotene Capsules 300 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 86.5 days, 72.0 days and 60.0 days respectively.
