</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Budesonide Capsule</h2><h3>Treatment of Mild to Moderate Active Crohn’s Disease</h3><p class="First">Budesonide Capsules are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn's disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon in patients 8 years of age and older.</p><h3>Maintenance of Clinical Remission of Mild to Moderate Crohn’s Disease</h3><p class="First">Budesonide Capsules are indicated for the maintenance of clinical remission of mild to moderate Crohn’s disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon for up to 3 months in adults.</p><h2>Budesonide Capsule Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><h3>Treatment of Mild to Moderate Active Crohn’s Disease</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Budesonide Capsules is:</p><p><span class="Italics">Adults:</span> 9 mg orally once daily for up to 8 weeks. Repeated 8 week courses of Budesonide Capsules can be given for recurring episodes of active disease.</p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric patients 8 to 17 years who weigh more than 25 kg:</span> 9 mg orally once daily for up to 8 weeks, followed by 6 mg once daily for 2 weeks.</p><h3>Maintenance of Clinical Remission of Mild to Moderate Crohn’s Disease</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage in adults, following an 8 week course(s) of treatment for active disease and once the patient’s symptoms are controlled (CDAI less than 150), is Budesonide Capsules 6 mg orally once daily for maintenance of clinical remission up to 3 months. If symptom control is still maintained at 3 months an attempt to taper to complete cessation is recommended. Continued treatment with Budesonide Capsules 6 mg for more than 3 months has not been shown to provide substantial clinical benefit.</p><p>Patients with mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease involving the ileum and/or ascending colon have been switched from oral prednisolone to Budesonide Capsules with no reported episodes of adrenal insufficiency. Since prednisolone should not be stopped abruptly, tapering should begin concomitantly with initiating Budesonide Capsules treatment.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment in Adult Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Consider reducing the dosage of Budesonide Capsules to 3 mg once daily for adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Capsules: 3 mg hard gelatin capsules with an opaque light grey body and an opaque pink cap, coded with ENTOCORT EC 3 mg.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Budesonide Capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to budesonide or any of the ingredients of Budesonide Capsules. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have occurred <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypercorticism and Adrenal Axis Suppression</h3><p class="First">When corticosteroids are used chronically, systemic effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression may occur. Corticosteroids can reduce the response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress. In situations where patients are subject to surgery or other stress situations, supplementation with a systemic corticosteroid is recommended. Since Budesonide Capsules contains a corticosteroid, general warnings concerning corticosteroids should be followed <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), (5.3), (5.4)].</span></p><p>Pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease have a slightly higher systemic exposure of budesonide and increased cortisol suppression than adults with Crohn’s disease <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].</span> Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C respectively) could be at an increased risk of hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression due to an increased systemic exposure of oral budesonide. Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Monitor for increased signs and/or symptoms of hypercorticism and consider reducing the dosage in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Symptoms of Steroid Withdrawal in Patients Transferred from Other Systemic Corticosteroids</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients who are transferred from corticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects to corticosteroids with lower systemic availability, such as Budesonide Capsules, since symptoms attributed to withdrawal of steroid therapy, including those of acute adrenal axis suppression or benign intracranial hypertension, may develop. Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these patients and the dose of corticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects should be reduced cautiously.</p><p>Replacement of systemic corticosteroids with Budesonide Capsules may unmask allergies (e.g., rhinitis and eczema), which were previously controlled by the systemic drug.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Infection</h3><p class="First">Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible patients or patients on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids. In patients who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure.</p><p>How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See prescribing information for VZIG and IG). If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</p><p>Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection, untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex.</p><h3>Other Corticosteroid Effects</h3><p class="First">Monitor patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma or cataracts, or with a family history of diabetes or glaucoma, or with any other condition where corticosteroids may have unwanted effects.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to Budesonide Capsules in 520 patients with Crohn’s disease, including 520 exposed to 9 mg per day (total daily dose) for 8 weeks and 145 exposed to 6 mg per day for one year in placebo controlled clinical trials. Of the 520 patients, 38% were males and the age range was 17 to 74 years.</p><p><span class="Italics">Treatment of Mild to Moderate Active Crohn’s Disease</span></p><p>The safety of Budesonide Capsules was evaluated in 651 adult patients in five clinical trials of 8 weeks duration in patients with active mild to moderate Crohn’s disease.

Avoid use with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant oral administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) caused an eight-fold increase of the systemic exposure to oral budesonide. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and cyclosporine) can increase systemic budesonide concentrations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Grapefruit Juice</span></p><p>Avoid ingestion of grapefruit juice with budesonide. Intake of grapefruit juice which inhibits CYP3A4 activity with budesonide can increase the systemic exposure for budesonide <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published studies report on the use of budesonide in pregnant women; however, the data are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are clinical considerations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</span>. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, administration of subcutaneous budesonide during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.5 times or 0.05 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, resulted in increased fetal loss, decreased pup weights, and skeletal abnormalities. Maternal toxicity was observed in both rats and rabbits at these dose levels <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>Some published epidemiological studies show an association of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with Crohn’s disease, including preterm birth and low birth weight infants, during periods of increased disease activity (including increased stool frequency and abdominal pain). Pregnant women with Crohn’s disease should be counseled regarding the importance of controlling disease.</p><p><span class="Italics">Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions</span></p><p>Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Infants should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism, such as poor feeding, irritability, weakness, and vomiting, and managed accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Budesonide was teratogenic and embryolethal in rabbits and rats.</p><p>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed subcutaneously with budesonide during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-15 there were effects on fetal development and survival at subcutaneous doses up to approximately 500 mcg/kg in rats (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-18, increase in maternal abortion, and effects on fetal development and reduction in litter weights at subcutaneous doses up to approximately 25 mcg/kg in rabbits (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). Maternal toxicity, including reduction in body weight gain, was observed at subcutaneous doses of 5 mcg/kg in rabbits (approximately 0.01 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) and 500 mcg/kg in rats (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis).</p><p>In a peri-and post-natal development study, rats dosed subcutaneously with budesonide during the period of Day 15 post coitum to Day 21 postpartum, budesonide had no effects on delivery but did have an effect on growth and development of offspring. In addition, offspring survival was reduced and surviving offspring had decreased mean body weights at birth and during lactation at exposures 0.02 times the MRHD (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 20 mcg/kg/day and higher). These findings occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Lactation studies have not been conducted with oral budesonide, including Budesonide Capsules, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. One published study reports that budesonide is present in human milk following maternal inhalation of budesonide <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Budesonide Capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Budesonide Capsules, or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>One published study reports that budesonide is present in human milk following maternal inhalation of budesonide which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.3% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Budesonide plasma concentrations were not detected and no adverse events were noted in the breastfed infants following maternal use of inhaled budesonide. The recommended daily dose of Budesonide Capsules is higher (up to 9 mg daily) compared with inhaled budesonide (up to 800 mcg daily) given to mothers in the above described study. The maximum budesonide plasma concentration following a 9 mg daily dose (in both single- and repeated-dose pharmacokinetic studies) of oral budesonide is approximately 5 to 10 nmol/L which is up to 10 times higher than the 1 to 2 nmol/L for a 800 mcg daily dose of inhaled budesonide at steady state in the above inhalation study. Assuming the coefficient of extrapolation between the inhaled and oral doses is constant across all dose levels, at therapeutic doses of Budesonide Capsules, budesonide exposure to the nursing child may be up to 10 times higher than that by budesonide inhalation.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Budesonide Capsules have been established in pediatric patients 8 to 17 years of age who weigh more than 25 kg for the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon. Use of Budesonide Capsules in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of Budesonide Capsules in adults, with additional data from 2 clinical studies in 149 pediatric patients treated up to 8 weeks and one pharmacokinetic study in 8 pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>.</p><p>The observed safety profile of Budesonide Capsules in pediatric patients is consistent with its known safety profile in adults and no new safety concerns were identified <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>Systemic corticosteroids, including Budesonide Capsules, may cause a reduction of growth velocity in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease have a 17% higher mean systemic exposure and cortisol suppression than adults with Crohn’s disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Budesonide Capsules have not been established in pediatric patients less than 8 years of age for the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Budesonide Capsules have not been established in pediatric patients for the maintenance of clinical remission of mild to moderate Crohn’s disease. An open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Budesonide Capsules as maintenance treatment in pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years was conducted, and did not establish the safety and efficacy of maintenance of clinical remission.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Budesonide Capsules did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Of the 651 patients treated with Budesonide Capsules in clinical studies, 17 (3%) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and none were greater than 74 years of age. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and C, respectively) could be at an increased risk of hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression due to an increased systemic exposure to budesonide <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Monitor for increased signs and/or symptoms of hypercorticism and consider dosage reduction in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]</span>. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Reports of acute toxicity and/or death following overdosage of glucocorticoids are rare. Treatment consists of immediate gastric lavage or emesis followed by supportive and symptomatic therapy.</p><p>If corticosteroids are used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression may occur. For chronic overdosage in the case of severe disease requiring continuous steroid therapy, the dosage may be reduced temporarily.</p><p>Single oral doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg were lethal in female and male mice, respectively. The signs of acute toxicity were decreased motor activity, piloerection and generalized edema.</p><h2>Budesonide Capsule Description</h2><p class="First">Budesonide, the active ingredient of Budesonide Capsules, is a synthetic corticosteroid. Budesonide is designated chemically as (RS)-11β, 16α, 17,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with butyraldehyde. Budesonide is provided as a mixture of two epimers (22R and 22S). The empirical formula of budesonide is C<span class="Sub">25</span>H<span class="Sub">34</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span> and its molecular weight is 430.5.</p><p>Its structural formula is:</p><p>Budesonide is a white to off-white, tasteless, odorless powder that is practically insoluble in water and heptane, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in chloroform. Its partition coefficient between octanol and water at pH 5 is 1.6 x 10<span class="Sup">3</span> ionic strength 0.01.</p><p>Budesonide Capsules are formulated as hard gelatin capsules filled with enteric-coated granules that dissolve at pH greater than 5.5. Each capsule for oral administration contains 3 mg of micronized budesonide with the following inactive ingredients: ethylcellulose, acetyltributyl citrate, methacrylic acid copolymer type C, triethyl citrate, antifoam M, polysorbate 80, talc, and sugar spheres. The capsule shells have the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, iron oxide, and titanium dioxide.</p><h2>Budesonide Capsule - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid and has a high glucocorticoid effect and a weak mineralocorticoid effect, and the affinity of budesonide to glucocorticoid receptors, which reflects the intrinsic potency of the drug, is about 200-fold that of cortisol and 15-fold that of prednisolone.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Treatment with glucocorticoids, including Budesonide Capsules is associated with a suppression of endogenous cortisol concentrations and an impairment of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. There was a positive correlation between the percent (%) reduction of AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> of plasma cortisol and systemic exposure to budesonide both in pediatric and adult patients.</p><p><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>Plasma cortisol suppression was compared following five days’ administration of Budesonide Capsules and prednisolone in a crossover study in healthy volunteers. The mean decrease in the area under the plasma cortisol concentration-time curve over 24 hour (AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span>) was greater (78%) with prednisolone 20 mg per day compared to 45% with Budesonide Capsules 9 mg per day.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>The effect of budesonide on endogenous cortisol concentrations was compared between pediatrics (n=8, aged 9 to 14 years) and adults (n=6) with active Crohn’s disease following administration of Budesonide Capsules 9 mg once daily for 7 days. Compared to baseline values before treatment, the mean decrease in the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24</span> of cortisol was 64% (±18%) in pediatrics and 50% (±27%) in adults after Budesonide Capsules treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p>The responses to adrenocorticotropin challenge (i.e., ACTH stimulation test) was studied in pediatric patients aged 8 to 17 years, with mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease in randomized, double-blind, active control study <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span>. After 8 weeks of treatment with 9 mg once daily Budesonide Capsules or with prednisolone, administered at tapering doses starting from 1 mg/kg, the proportion of patients with normal response to the ACTH challenge was 6% in the budesonide group compared to none in the prednisolone group; the proportion of patients with morning p-cortisol of greater than 5 mcg/dL was 50% in the budesonide group compared to 22% in the prednisolone group.

Cortisol concentration was measured at 30 min after intravenous or intramuscular injection of 0.25 mg cosyntropin at baseline and at week 8 after treatment.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Following administration of Budesonide Capsules, the time to peak concentration varied in individual patients between 30 and 600 minutes. Mean oral bioavailability of budesonide ranged from 9% to 21% both in patients and in healthy subjects, demonstrating a high first-pass elimination of the drug.</p><p>Budesonide pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional following repeated administration in the dose range of 3 to 15 mg. No accumulation of budesonide was observed following repeated dosing.</p><p>Following oral administration of 9 mg Budesonide Capsules for five days in healthy subjects, the mean peak plasma concentration and the steady state area under the plasma concentration time curve for budesonide were 5.3 ± 1.8 nmol/L and 37.0 ±14.6 nmol•hr/L, respectively.</p><p>Following administration of 9 mg Budesonide Capsules once daily in patients with active Crohn’s disease, the mean peak plasma concentration and AUC were 4.0 ±2.1 nmol/L and 35.0 ±19.8 nmol•h/L, respectively.</p><p>Concomitant administration of a high-fat meal delayed the time to peak concentration of budesonide from Budesonide Capsules by 2.3 hours but did not significantly affect the AUC in healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution (Vss) of budesonide varied between 2.2 and 3.9 L/kg in healthy subjects and in patients. Plasma protein binding was estimated to be 85% to 90% in the concentration range 1 to 230 nmol/L, independent of gender. The erythrocyte/plasma partition ratio at clinically relevant concentrations was about 0.8.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Budesonide had a plasma clearance, 0.9 to 1.8 L/min in healthy adults. Mean plasma clearance after intravenous administration of budesonide in patients with Crohn’s disease was 1.0 L/min. These plasma clearance values approached the estimated liver blood flow, and, accordingly, suggest that budesonide is a high hepatic clearance drug. The plasma elimination half-life, after administration of intravenous doses ranged between 2 and 3.6 hours, and did not differ between healthy adults and patients with Crohn’s disease.</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Following absorption, budesonide is subject to high first pass metabolism (80% to 90%). <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> experiments in human liver microsomes demonstrated that budesonide is rapidly and extensively biotransformed, mainly by CYP3A4, to its 2 major metabolites, 6β-hydroxy budesonide and 16α-hydroxy prednisolone. The corticosteroid activity of these metabolites was negligible (less than 1/100) in relation to that of the parent compound. <span class="Italics">In vivo</span> investigations with intravenous doses in healthy subjects were in agreement with the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> findings.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites.

Following administration of 9 mg Budesonide Capsules once daily for 7 days, the median time to peak plasma concentration of budesonide was 5 hours and the mean peak plasma concentration was 6.0 ± 3.5 nmol/L. The mean AUC was 41.3 ±12.2 nmol•h/L and 17% higher than that in adult patients with Crohn’s disease in the same study. The mean absolute oral availability was 9.2% (3 to 17%; n=4) in pediatric patients.</p><p>After single dose administration of intravenous budesonide (n=4), the mean volume of distribution (V<span class="Sub">ss</span>) was 2.2 ± 0.4 L/kg and mean clearance was 0.81 ± 0.2 L/min. The mean elimination half-life was 1.9 hours in pediatric patients.

Budesonide 4.5 mg once daily (one-half the recommended dose) for one week did not affect the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol, a CYP3A4 substrate. The effect of budesonide 9 mg once daily on the plasma concentrations of ethinyl estradiol was not studied.</p><p><span class="Italics">Omeprazole</span></p><p>In a study in 11 healthy subjects, performed in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled manner, the effect of 5 to 6 days treatment with omeprazole 20 mg once daily on the pharmacokinetics of budesonide administered as Budesonide Capsules 9 mg as a single dose was investigated.

Six healthy subjects received cimetidine 1 gram daily (200 mg with meals and 400 mg at night) for 2 separate 3-day periods. Budesonide 4 mg was administered either alone or on the last day of one of the cimetidine treatment periods. Co-administration of cimetidine resulted in a 52% and 31% increase in the budesonide peak plasma concentration and the AUC of budesonide, respectively.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Carcinogenicity studies with budesonide were conducted in rats and mice. In a two-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of gliomas in male rats at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). In addition, there were increased incidences of primary hepatocellular tumors in male rats at 25 mcg/kg (approximately 0.023 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) and above. No tumorigenicity was seen in female rats at oral doses up to 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). In an additional two-year study in male Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused no gliomas at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). However, it caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). The concurrent reference corticosteroids (prednisolone and triamcinolone acetonide) showed similar findings. In a 91-week study in mice, budesonide caused no treatment-related carcinogenicity at oral doses up to 200 mcg/kg (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). Budesonide was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation (TK +/-) test, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the <span class="Italics">Drosophila melanogaster</span> sex-linked recessive lethality test, the rat hepatocyte UDS test and the mouse micronucleus test.</p><p>In rats, budesonide had no effect on fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 80 mcg/kg (approximately 0.07 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). However, it caused a decrease in prenatal viability and viability in pups at birth and during lactation, along with a decrease in maternal body-weight gain, at subcutaneous doses of 20 mcg/kg (approximately 0.02 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) and above. No such effects were noted at 5 mcg/kg (approximately 0.005 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Treatment of Mild to Moderate Active Crohn’s Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults</span></p><p>The efficacy of Budesonide Capsules were evaluated in 994 patients with mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease of the ileum and/or ascending colon in 5 randomized and double-blind studies of 8 weeks duration. The study patients ranged in age from 17 to 85 (mean 35), 40% were male and 97% were white. The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was the main clinical assessment used for determining efficacy in these 5 studies.<span class="Sup">1</span> The CDAI is a validated index based on subjective aspects rated by the patient (frequency of liquid or very soft stools, abdominal pain rating and general well-being) and objective observations (number of extraintestinal symptoms, need for antidiarrheal drugs, presence of abdominal mass, body weight and hematocrit). Clinical improvement, defined as a CDAI score of less than or equal to 150 assessed after 8 weeks of treatment, was the primary efficacy variable in these 5 comparative efficacy studies of Budesonide Capsules. Safety assessments in these studies included monitoring of adverse reactions. A checklist of potential symptoms of hypercorticism was used.</p><p>One study (Study 1) compared the efficacy of Budesonide Capsules 9 mg daily in the morning to a comparator.

Study 2 involved 258 patients and tested the effects of graded doses of Budesonide Capsules (1.5 mg twice daily, 4.5 mg twice daily, or 7.5 mg twice daily) versus placebo. At baseline, the median CDAI was 290. The 1.5 mg twice daily arm (data not shown) could not be differentiated from placebo. The 4.5 mg twice daily arm was statistically different from placebo (Table 5), while no additional benefit was seen when the daily Budesonide Capsules dose was increased to 15 mg per day (data not shown). Study 3 was a 3-armed parallel group study. The groups were treated with Budesonide Capsules 9 mg once daily, Budesonide Capsules 4.5 mg twice daily and placebo for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week double-blind taper phase. The median CDAI at baseline was 263. Neither 9 mg daily nor 4.5 mg twice daily Budesonide Capsules dose levels were statistically different from placebo (Table 5). The recommended dosage of Budesonide Capsules for the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon in adults is 9 mg once daily in the morning for up to 8 weeks <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p>Two clinical trials (Studies 4 and 5) compared Budesonide Capsules with oral prednisolone (initial dose 40 mg per day).

Patients ranged in age from 18 to 73 (mean 37) years. Sixty percent of the patients were female and 99% were Caucasian. The mean CDAI at entry was 96. Among the four clinical trials, approximately 75% of the patients enrolled had exclusively ileal disease. Colonoscopy was not performed following treatment. Budesonide Capsules 6 mg per day prolonged the time to relapse, defined as an increase in CDAI of at least 60 units to a total score greater than 150 or withdrawal due to disease deterioration. The median time to relapse in the pooled population of the 4 studies was 154 days for patients taking placebo, and 268 days for patients taking Budesonide Capsules 6 mg per day. Budesonide Capsules 6 mg per day reduced the proportion of patients with loss of symptom control relative to placebo in the pooled population for the 4 studies at 3 months (28% versus 45% for placebo).</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First">1.
