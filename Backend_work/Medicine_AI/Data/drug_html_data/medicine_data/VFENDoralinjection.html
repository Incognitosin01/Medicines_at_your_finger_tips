Use the medicine exactly as directed.</p><p>Take <b>oral</b> voriconazole (tablets or liquid) at least <b>1 hour before or 1 hour after</b> eating a meal.</p><p>Shake the <b>liquid</b> before you measure a dose. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).</p><p>Do not mix voriconazole <b>liquid</b> with any other medicine or liquid.</p><p>Voriconazole injection is given as a slow infusion into a vein, over 1 to 2 hours. Voriconazole is usually given by injection only if you are unable to take the medicine by mouth. A healthcare provider will give your first dose and may teach you how to properly use the medication by yourself.</p><p>Voriconazole injection is a powder medicine that must be mixed with a liquid (diluent) before using it. When using injections by yourself, be sure you understand how to properly mix and store the medicine.</p><p>Prepare your injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>If you cannot use the <b>mixed injection</b> right away, store it in the refrigerator and use it within 24 hours. Do not freeze.</p><p>Use a needle and syringe only once and then place them in a puncture-proof "sharps" container. Follow state or local laws about how to dispose of this container. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets.</p><p>Voriconazole is sometimes given for up to several days after lab tests show that the infection has cleared. Very severe infections may need to be treated for several weeks.</p><p>Use this medicine for the full prescribed length of time, even if your symptoms quickly improve. Skipping doses can increase your risk of infection that is resistant to medication. Voriconazole will not treat a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold.</p><p>You may need frequent blood tests. Your vision and kidney or liver function may also need to be checked.</p><p>Store voriconazole <b>tablets</b> or <b>liquid</b> at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not store in a refrigerator or freezer. Keep the medicine bottle tightly closed when not in use. Throw away any unused <b>liquid</b> after 14 days.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
