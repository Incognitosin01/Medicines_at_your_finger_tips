Coagulation factors II, IX, and X are part of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, while factor VII is part of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. In the <i>extrinsic</i> pathway, damaged blood vessels release endothelial tissue factor (TF) which complexes with factor VII to form TF-factor VIIa. Within the <i>intrinsic</i> pathway, factor IX is converted to IXa. Factor IXa (as well as TF-factor VIIa) converts factor X to factor Xa in the final common pathway of coagulation. Factor Xa activates prothrombin (factor II) into thrombin (IIa) which converts fibrinogen into fibrin resulting in clot formation. Proteins C and S are vitamin K-dependent inhibiting enzymes involved in regulating the coagulation process. Protein S serves as a cofactor for protein C which is converted to activated protein C (APC). APC is a serine protease which inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, limiting thrombotic formation. </p><h3>Distribution</h3><p>V<sub>dss</sub>: Factor II: 71.4 mL/kg; Factor VII: 45 mL/kg; Factor IX: 114.3 mL/kg; Factor X: 55.5 mL/kg; Protein C: 62.2 mL/kg; Protein S: 78.8 mL/kg</p><h2>Onset of Action</h2><p>Rapid; significant INR decline within 10 minutes</p><h2>Duration of Action</h2><p>~6 to 8 hours</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>Factor II: 48 to 60 hours; Factor VII: 1.5 to 6 hours; Factor IX: 20 to 24 hours; Factor X: 24 to 48 hours; Protein C: 1.5 to 6 hours; Protein S: 24 to 48 hours</p><p><b>Note:</b> Half-lives may be significantly reduced in severe hepatocellular damage, DIC, or extended catabolic metabolism.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Bleeding, treatment and prophylaxis:</b> Urgent reversal of acquired coagulation factor deficiency induced by vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (eg, warfarin) therapy in patients with acute major bleeding or a need for an urgent surgery/invasive procedure</p><h2>Off Label Uses</h2><h3>Life-threatening bleeding associated with non-vitamin K antagonists</h3><p>Based on the Anticoagulation Forum guidance document on the reversal of direct oral anticoagulants, use of prothrombin complex concentrate (human) may be considered for the treatment of life-threatening bleeding associated with oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) (if andexanet alfa is unavailable) <sup>[Cuker 2019]</sup>.

Prior to reconstitution, allow diluent (SWFI) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) vials to warm to room temperature. Aseptically push the plastic spike at the blue end of the Mix2Vial transfer set through the center of the stopper of the diluent vial. After carefully removing only the clear blister package from the Mix2Vial transfer set, invert the diluent vial with the transfer set still attached and push the plastic spike through the center of the stopper of PCC vial; diluent will automatically transfer. While still attached, gently swirl PCC vial to ensure product is dissolved; do not shake. Disconnect the 2 vials; contents of PCC vial are now available for removal by screwing a syringe onto the transfer set. Inject appropriate amount of air into vial, invert vial, and withdraw amount needed. Remove syringe from transfer set and attach an administration set to the syringe. Refer to manufacturer's labeling for detailed preparation instructions.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Potency on the vial label is expressed in terms of the factor IX nominal strength (500 units or 1,000 units). Consult individual vial labels for exact potency within each vial. Manufacturerâ€™s labeling recommends the exact amount of factor IX units in each vial be used when calculating and preparing the total dose to be administered. However, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices recommends using the nominal strength as described in clinical trials (ISMP 2017).</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>Kcentra, Beriplex P/N [Canadian product]: IV: Administer at room temperature at a rate of 0.12 mL/kg/minute (~3 <b>units</b>/kg/minute); do <b>not</b> exceed 8.4 mL/minute (~210 <b>units</b>/minute).

Weigh potential benefits of reversing vitamin K antagonist against the potential risks of thromboembolic events, especially in patients with history of a thromboembolic event. Carefully consider resumption of anticoagulation as soon as the risk of thromboembolic events outweighs the risk of acute bleeding.</p><p>Both fatal and nonfatal arterial and venous thromboembolic complications have been reported with prothrombin complex concentrate in clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance. Monitor patients receiving prothrombin complex concentrate for signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events.</p><p>Prothrombin complex concentrate was not studied in subjects who had a thromboembolic event, myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cerebral vascular accident, transient ischemic attack, unstable angina pectoris, or severe peripheral vascular disease within the prior 3 months.

Benefits of reversing VKA therapy should be weighed against the potential risk of a thromboembolic event. Resumption of anticoagulation should occur once the risk of thromboembolism outweighs the risk of acute bleeding. Fatal and nonfatal arterial and venous thromboembolic complications and DIC have been reported; closely monitor for thromboembolic events during and after administration.

Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Appropriate use: <b>Prothrombin complex concentrate (Human) [(Factors II, VII, IX, X), Protein C, Protein S] contains therapeutic levels of factor VII component</b> and should not be confused with Factor IX complex (Human) [Factors II, IX, X] (Bebulin, Profilnine) which contains low or nontherapeutic levels of factor VII.</p><p>â€¢ Coagulation factor deficiency: Hepatic synthesis of the prothrombin complex (Factors II, VII, IX and X) coagulation factors is vitamin K dependent. Severe hepatic dysfunction, inadequate absorption of vitamin K (eg, pancreatic disorders, diarrhea) or vitamin K antagonist therapy or overdose may lead to coagulation factor deficiencies. In patients with an acquired deficiency of the vitamin K dependent coagulation factors, administer PCC only if a rapid correction (eg, emergency surgery, major bleeding) is necessary. If not indicated and caused by Vitamin K antagonist therapy, coagulation factor deficiencies may be managed by reducing or discontinuing therapy of the vitamin K antagonist and/or administration of vitamin K.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>INR (baseline and at 30 minutes post dose); clinical response during and after treatment; signs of thromboembolism</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>This product is derived from purified human plasma.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>â€¢ It is used to undo the effects of certain blood thinners like warfarin.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
