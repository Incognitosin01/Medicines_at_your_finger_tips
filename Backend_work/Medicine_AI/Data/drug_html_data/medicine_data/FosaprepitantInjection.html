<li>who are hypersensitive to any component of the product. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions, flushing, erythema, and dyspnea have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></li>
<li>taking pimozide. Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant, the active moiety, could result in elevated plasma concentrations of this drug, which is a CYP3A4 substrate, potentially causing serious or life-threatening reactions, such as QT prolongation, a known adverse reaction of pimozide <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Clinically Significant CYP3A4 Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and aprepitant is a substrate, inhibitor, and inducer of CYP3A4.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use of fosaprepitant with other drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates, may result in increased plasma concentration of the concomitant drug.
<ul class="Disc">
<li>Use of pimozide with fosaprepitant is contraindicated due to the risk of significantly increased plasma concentrations of pimozide, potentially resulting in prolongation of the QT interval, a known adverse reaction of pimozide <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use of fosaprepitant with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, diltiazem) may increase plasma concentrations of aprepitant and result in an increased risk of adverse reactions related to fosaprepitant.</li>
<li>Use of fosaprepitant with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may result in a reduction in aprepitant plasma concentrations and decreased efficacy of fosaprepitant.</li>
</ul><ul class="Disc">
<li>Use of pimozide with fosaprepitant is contraindicated due to the risk of significantly increased plasma concentrations of pimozide, potentially resulting in prolongation of the QT interval, a known adverse reaction of pimozide <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span></li>
</ul><p>See Table 7 and Table 8 for a listing of potentially significant drug interactions <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, during or soon after infusion of fosaprepitant have occurred. Symptoms including flushing, erythema, dyspnea, hypotension and syncope have been reported <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Monitor patients during and after infusion. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapy. Do not reinitiate fosaprepitant in patients who experience these symptoms with previous use <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</p><h3>Infusion Site Reactions</h3><p class="First">Infusion site reactions (ISRs) have been reported with the use of fosaprepitant for injection <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. The majority of severe ISRs, including thrombophlebitis and vasculitis, were reported with concomitant vesicant (anthracycline-based) chemotherapy administration, particularly when associated with extravasation. Necrosis was also reported in some patients with concomitant vesicant chemotherapy. Most ISRs occurred with the first, second or third exposure to single doses of fosaprepitant for injection and in some cases, reactions persisted for two weeks or longer. Treatment of severe ISRs consisted of medical, and in some cases surgical, intervention.<br/>
<br/>
Avoid infusion of fosaprepitant for injection into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a severe ISR develops during infusion, discontinue the infusion and administer appropriate medical treatment.</p><h3>Decrease in INR with Concomitant Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of fosaprepitant with warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, may result in a clinically significant decrease in the International Normalized Ratio (INR) of prothrombin time <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Monitor the INR in patients on chronic warfarin therapy in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following initiation of fosaprepitant with each chemotherapy cycle <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Risk of Reduced Efficacy of Hormonal Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Upon coadministration with fosaprepitant, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during administration of and for 28 days following the last dose of fosaprepitant <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Advise patients to use effective alternative or back-up methods of contraception during treatment with fosaprepitant and for 1 month following administration of fosaprepitant <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypersensitivity Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Infusion Site Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.<br/>
<br/>
The overall safety of fosaprepitant for injection was evaluated in approximately 1,600 adult patients.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Adverse Reactions in Adults for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC<br/></span><br/>
In an active-controlled clinical trial in patients receiving MEC, safety was evaluated in 504 patients receiving a single dose of fosaprepitant for injection  in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone (fosaprepitant regimen) compared to 497 patients receiving ondansetron and dexamethasone alone (standard therapy). The most common adverse reactions are listed in Table 6.</p><p>Infusion-site reactions were reported in 2.2% of patients treated with the fosaprepitant regimen compared to 0.6% of patients treated with standard therapy. The infusion-site reactions included: infusion-site pain (1.2%, 0.4%), injection-site irritation (0.2%, 0.0%), vessel puncture-site pain (0.2%, 0.0%), and infusion-site thrombophlebitis (0.6%, 0.0%), reported in the fosaprepitant regimen compared to standard therapy, respectively.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Adverse Reactions in Adults for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with HEC<br/></span><br/>
In an active-controlled clinical study in patients receiving HEC, safety was evaluated for 1,143 patients receiving a single dose of fosaprepitant for injection compared to 1,169 patients receiving the 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span> The safety profile was generally similar to that seen in the MEC study with fosaprepitant and prior HEC studies with aprepitant. However, infusion-site reactions occurred at a higher incidence in patients in the fosaprepitant group (3.0%) compared to those in the aprepitant group (0.5%). The following additional infusion-site reactions occurred in the HEC study and were not reported in the MEC study described above: infusion-site erythema (0.5%, 0.1%), infusion-site pruritus (0.3%, 0.0%), and infusion-site induration (0.2%, 0.1%), reported in the fosaprepitant group compared to the aprepitant group, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Because fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant, those adverse reactions associated with aprepitant might also be expected to occur with fosaprepitant for injection. See the full prescribing information for aprepitant capsules for complete safety information regarding studies performed with oral aprepitant.<br/>

Therefore, drug interactions following administration of fosaprepitant for injection are likely to occur with drugs that interact with oral aprepitant.</p><p>Fosaprepitant, given as a single 150 mg dose, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and the weak inhibition of CYP3A4 continues for 2 days after single dose administration. Single dose fosaprepitant does not induce CYP3A4. Aprepitant is a substrate, an inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Some substrates of CYP3A4 are contraindicated with fosaprepitant <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> Dosage adjustment of some CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates may be warranted, as shown in Table 7.</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant</h3><p class="First">Aprepitant is a CYP3A4 substrate <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Co-administration of fosaprepitant with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may result in increased or decreased plasma concentrations of aprepitant, respectively, as shown in Table 8.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/>
<br/></span> There are insufficient data on use of fosaprepitant in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in rats or rabbits exposed during the period of organogenesis to systemic drug levels (AUC) approximately equivalent to the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) of 150 mg <span class="Italics">[see Data].<br/></span><br/>
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Data<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Animal Data<br/></span><br/>
In embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, aprepitant was administered during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 1,000 mg/kg twice daily (rats) and up to the maximum tolerated dose of 25 mg/kg/day (rabbits). No embryofetal lethality or malformations were observed at any dose level in either species. The exposures (AUC) in pregnant rats at 1,000 mg/kg twice daily and in pregnant rabbits at 25 mg/kg/day were approximately equivalent to the exposure at the RHD of 150 mg. Aprepitant crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary<br/></span><br/>
Lactation studies have not been conducted to assess the presence of aprepitant in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Aprepitant is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for fosaprepitant and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from fosaprepitant or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Contraception<br/></span><br/>
Upon administration of fosaprepitant, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced. Advise females of reproductive potential using hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative or back-up non-hormonal contraceptive (such as condoms and spermicides) during treatment with fosaprepitant and for 1 month following the last dose <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of fosaprepitant for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with HEC or MEC have not been established in patients less than 6 months of age.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data<br/></span><br/>
In juvenile dogs treated with fosaprepitant, changes in reproductive organs were observed. In juvenile rats treated with aprepitant, slight changes in sexual maturation were observed without an effect on reproduction. No effects on neurobehavior, sensory and motor function, or learning and memory were observed in rats.<br/>
<br/>
In a toxicity study in juvenile dogs treated with fosaprepitant from postnatal day 14 (equivalent to a newborn human) to day 42 (approximately equivalent to a 2 year old human), decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/day and increased uterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and edema of vaginal tissues were seen in females from 4 mg/kg/day. A study was also conducted in young rats to evaluate the effects of aprepitant on growth and on neurobehavioral and sexual development. Rats were treated at oral doses up to the maximum feasible dose of 1,000 mg/kg twice daily from the early postnatal period (Postnatal Day 10 (equivalent to a newborn human) through Postnatal Day 58 (approximately equivalent to a 15 year old human)). Slight changes in the onset of sexual maturation were observed in female and male rats; however, there were no effects on mating, fertility, embryonic-fetal survival, or histomorphology of the reproductive organs. There were no effects in neurobehavioral tests of sensory function, motor function, and learning and memory.<br/>

However, due to Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the 1,649 adult cancer patients treated with intravenous fosaprepitant in HEC and MEC clinical studies, 27%  were aged  65 and  over,  while  5%  were  aged  75  and  over. Other reported clinical experience with fosaprepitant has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, use caution when dosing elderly patients as they have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and concomitant disease or other drug therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those of healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 9). There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9). Therefore, additional monitoring for adverse reactions in these patients may be warranted when fosaprepitant is administered <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no specific information on the treatment of overdosage with fosaprepitant or aprepitant.<br/>
<br/>
In the event of overdose, fosaprepitant should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and monitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of fosaprepitant, drug-induced emesis may not be effective in cases of fosaprepitant overdosage.<br/>
<br/>
Aprepitant is not removed by hemodialysis.</p><h2>Fosaprepitant Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Fosaprepitant for injection is a sterile, white to off white lyophilized cake or powder formulation containing fosaprepitant dimeglumine, a prodrug of aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK<span class="Sub">1</span>) receptor antagonist, an antiemetic agent, chemically described as 1-­Deoxy-1-(methylamino)-D-glucitol[3-[[(2<span class="Italics">R</span>,3<span class="Italics">S</span>)-2-[(1<span class="Italics">R</span>)-1-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethoxy]-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-morpholinyl]methyl]-2,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1<span class="Italics">H</span>-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]phosphonate (2:1) (salt).<br/>
<br/>
Its molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">23</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>F<span class="Sub">7</span>N<span class="Sub">4</span>O<span class="Sub">6</span>P • 2(C<span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">17</span>NO<span class="Sub">5</span>) and its structural formula is:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fosaprepitant dimeglumine is a white to off-white amorphous powder with a molecular weight of 1,004.83. It is freely soluble in water.<br/>
<br/>
Each vial of fosaprepitant for injection for administration as an intravenous infusion contains 150 mg of fosaprepitant (equivalent to 245.3 mg of fosaprepitant dimeglumine) and the following inactive ingredients: edetate disodium (18.8 mg), polysorbate 80 (75 mg), lactose anhydrous (375 mg), sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment).</p><h2>Fosaprepitant Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Fosaprepitant is a prodrug of aprepitant and accordingly, its antiemetic effects are attributable to aprepitant.<br/>
<br/>
Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK<span class="Sub">1</span>) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span>), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, via central actions. Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies with aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK<span class="Sub">1</span> receptors. Animal and human studies have shown that aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span>-receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin-induced emesis.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiac Electrophysiology<br/></span><br/>
In a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, thorough QT<span class="Sub">c</span> study, a single 200 mg dose of fosaprepitant (approximately 1.3 times the recommended dose) had no effect on the QTc interval.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Aprepitant after Fosaprepitant Administration<br/></span><br/>
Following administration of a single intravenous 150 mg dose of fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant administered as a 20-minute infusion to healthy subjects, the mean AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of aprepitant was 37.4 (± 14.8) mcg•hr/mL and the mean maximal aprepitant concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) was 4.2 (± 1.2) mcg/mL. Plasma concentrations of fosaprepitant are below the limits of quantification (10 ng/mL) within 30 minutes of the completion of infusion.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Distribution<br/></span><br/>
Aprepitant is greater than 95% bound to plasma proteins. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vd<span class="Sub">ss</span>) was approximately 70 L in humans.<br/>
<br/>
Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier in humans <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].<br/></span> <span class="Bold"><br/>
Elimination<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Metabolism<br/></span><br/>
Fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> incubations with human liver preparations and in S9 preparations from multiple other human tissues including kidney, lung and ileum. Thus, it appears that the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant can occur in multiple extrahepatic tissues in addition to the liver.<br/>
<br/>
Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains. No metabolism by CYP2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1 was detected.<br/>
<br/>
In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for approximately 24% of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300 mg dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-aprepitant, indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Excretion<br/></span><br/>
Following administration of a single intravenous 100 mg dose of [<span class="Sup">14</span>C]-fosaprepitant to healthy subjects, 57% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45% in feces.<br/>
<br/>
Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism; aprepitant is not renally excreted. The apparent terminal half-life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Specific Populations<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Age: Geriatric Population<br/>
<br/></span> Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> of aprepitant was 21% higher on Day 1 and 36% higher on Day 5 in elderly (65 years and older) relative to younger adults. The C<span class="Sub">max</span> was 10% higher on Day 1 and 24% higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Sex<br/></span><br/>
Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> are 9% and 17% higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is approximately 25% lower in females as compared with males and T<span class="Sub">max</span> occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Race/Ethnicity<br/></span><br/>
Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant, ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg, the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> are approximately 27% and 19% higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians. The AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were 74% and 47% higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians. There was no difference in AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> or C<span class="Sub">max</span> between Caucasians and Blacks. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Renal Impairment<br/></span><br/>
A single 240 mg oral dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> as measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis.<br/>
<br/>
In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound) decreased by 21% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> decreased by 32%, relative to healthy subjects (creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault method). In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, the AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of total aprepitant decreased by 42% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> decreased by 32%. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate.<br/>

<span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment<br/></span><br/>
Fosaprepitant is metabolized in various extrahepatic tissues; therefore hepatic impairment is not expected to alter the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant.<br/>
<br/>
Following administration of a single 125 mg oral dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> of aprepitant was 11% lower on Day 1 and 36% lower on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> of aprepitant was 10% higher on Day 1 and 18% higher on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. These differences in AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> are not considered clinically meaningful. There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.<br/>

Body Mass Index (BMI)<br/></span><br/>
For every 5 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> increase in BMI, AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of aprepitant decrease by 9% and 10%. BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> to 36 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. This change is not considered clinically meaningful.<br/>

Drug Interactions Studies<br/></span><br/>
Fosaprepitant, given as a single 150 mg dose, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, with no evidence of inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 observed on Day 4. The weak inhibition of CYP3A4 continues for 2 days after single dose administration of fosaprepitant. Aprepitant is a substrate, an inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9.<br/>
<br/>
Fosaprepitant or aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P­-glycoprotein transporter.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Effects of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
CYP3A4 Substrates<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Midazolam:</span> Fosaprepitant 150 mg administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span> of midazolam by approximately 1.8-fold on Day 1 and had no effect on Day 4 when midazolam was coadministered as a single oral dose of 2 mg on Days 1 and 4 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Corticosteroids:<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Dexamethasone:</span> Fosaprepitant administered as a single 150 mg intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC<span class="Sub">0-24hr</span> of dexamethasone, administered as a single 8 mg oral dose on Days 1, 2, and 3, by approximately 2-fold on Days 1 and 2 <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Methylprednisolone:</span> When oral aprepitant as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) was administered with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg on Day 1 and oral methylprednisolone 40 mg on Days 2 and 3, the AUC of methylprednisolone was increased by 1.34-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3 <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Chemotherapeutic agents:<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Docetaxel:</span> In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Vinorelbine:</span> In a pharmacokinetic study, oral aprepitant administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Oral contraceptives:</span> When oral aprepitant was administered as a 3-day regimen (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg) with ondansetron and dexamethasone, and coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64% for 3 weeks post-treatment <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
CYP2C9 substrates (Warfarin, Tolbutamide):<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Warfarin:</span> A single 125 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy. Although there was no effect of oral aprepitant on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin determined on Day 3, there was a 34% decrease in S(-) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14% decrease in the prothrombin time (reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR) 5 days after completion of dosing with oral aprepitant <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Tolbutamide:</span> Oral aprepitant, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23% on Day 4, 28% on Day 8, and 15% on Day 15, when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered prior to the administration of the 3-day regimen of oral aprepitant and on Days 4, 8, and 15. This effect was not considered clinically important.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Other Drugs<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
P-glycoprotein substrates:</span> Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P-­glycoprotein transporter, as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral aprepitant with digoxin in a clinical drug interaction study.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
5-HT<span class="Sub">3</span> antagonists:</span> In clinical drug interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of dolasetron).<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Rifampin:</span> When a single 375 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of 600 mg/day of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11-fold and the mean terminal half-life decreased approximately 3-fold <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)]</span>.<br/>
<span class="Italics"><br/>
Ketoconazole:</span> When a single 125 mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of 400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Diltiazem:</span> In a study in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, administration of 100 mg of fosaprepitant as an intravenous infusion with 120 mg of diltiazem, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor administered three times daily, resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in the aprepitant AUC and a 1.4-fold increase in the diltiazem AUC.<br/>
<br/>
When fosaprepitant was administered with diltiazem, the mean maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater than that observed with diltiazem alone [24.3 ± 10.2 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 15.6 ± 4.1 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. The mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure was also greater after co-administration of diltiazem with fosaprepitant than administration of diltiazem alone [29.5 ± 7.9 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 23.8 ± 4.8 mm Hg without fosaprepitant]. Co-administration of fosaprepitant and diltiazem; however, did not result in any additional clinically significant changes in heart rate or PR interval, beyond those changes observed with diltiazem alone <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.2)].<br/></span> <span class="Italics"><br/>
Paroxetine:</span> Coadministration of once daily doses of oral aprepitant 170 mg, with paroxetine 20 mg once daily, resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25% and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by approximately 20% of both aprepitant and paroxetine. This effect was not considered clinically important.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis<br/></span><br/>
Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and in CD-1 mice for 2 years. In the rat carcinogenicity studies, animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 0.05 to 1,000 mg/kg twice daily. The highest dose produced systemic exposures to aprepitant approximately equivalent to (female rats) or less than (male rats) the adult human exposure at the RHD of 150 mg. Treatment with aprepitant at doses of 5 to 1,000 mg/kg twice daily caused an increase in the incidences of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenomas at 5 to 1,000 mg/kg twice daily and hepatocellular carcinomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas at 125 to 1,000 mg/kg twice daily. In the mouse carcinogenicity studies, the animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 2.5 to 2,000 mg/kg/day. The highest dose produced a systemic exposure approximately 2 times the adult human exposure at the RHD of 150 mg. Treatment with aprepitant produced skin fibrosarcomas at 125 and 500 mg/kg/day doses in male mice. Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with fosaprepitant.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Mutagenesis<br/></span><br/>
Aprepitant and fosaprepitant were not genotoxic in the Ames test, the human lymphoblastoid cell (TK6) mutagenesis test, the rat hepatocyte DNA strand break test, the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell chromosome aberration test and the mouse micronucleus test.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Impairment of Fertility<br/></span><br/>
Fosaprepitant, when administered intravenously, is rapidly converted to aprepitant. In the fertility studies conducted with fosaprepitant and aprepitant, the highest systemic exposures to aprepitant were obtained following oral administration of aprepitant. Oral aprepitant did not affect the fertility or general reproductive performance of male or female  rats  at  doses  up  to  the  maximum  feasible  dose  of 1,000 mg/kg twice daily (providing exposure in male rats lower than the exposure at the recommended adult human dose of 150 mg and exposure in female rats approximately equivalent to the adult human exposure).</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with HEC in Adults</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, parallel, double-blind, active-controlled study, fosaprepitant for injection 150 mg as a single intravenous infusion (N = 1,147) was compared to a 3-day oral aprepitant regimen (N = 1,175) in patients receiving a HEC regimen that included cisplatin (≥70 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). All patients in both groups received dexamethasone and ondansetron (see Table 11). Patient demographics were similar between the two treatment groups. Of the total 2,322 patients, 63% were men, 56% White, 26% Asian, 3% American Indian/Alaska Native, 2% Black, 13% Multi-Racial, and 33% Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 86 years of age, with a mean age of 56 years. Other concomitant chemotherapy agents commonly administered were fluorouracil (17%), gemcitabine (16%), paclitaxel (15%), and etoposide (12%). </p><p>The efficacy of fosaprepitant for injection was evaluated based on the primary and secondary endpoints listed in Table 12 and was shown to be non-inferior to that of the 3-day oral aprepitant regimen with regard to complete response in each of the evaluated phases. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for complete response in the overall phase was 7%. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for complete response in the delayed phase was 7.3%. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin for no vomiting in the overall phase was 8.2%.</p><h3>Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC in Adults</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, parallel, double-blind, active comparator-controlled study, fosaprepitant for injection 150 mg as a single intravenous infusion (N = 502) in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone (fosaprepitant regimen) was compared with ondansetron and dexamethasone alone (standard therapy) (N = 498) (see Table 13) in patients receiving a MEC regimen. Patient demographics were similar between the two treatment groups. Of the total 1,000 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 41% were men, 84% White, 4% Asian, 1% American Indian/Alaska Native, 2% Black, 10% Multi-Racial, and 19% Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 88 years of age, with a mean age of 60 years. The most commonly administered MEC chemotherapeutic agents were carboplatin (51%), oxaliplatin (24%), and cyclophosphamide (12%).</p><p>The primary endpoint was complete response (defined as no vomiting and no rescue therapy) in the delayed phase (25 to 120 hours) of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The results by treatment group are shown in Table 14.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Fosaprepitant for injection is a white to off white lyophilized cake or powder and is supplied as follows:<br/>
