</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets</h2><h3>Monotherapy and Combination Therapy</h3><p class="First">Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both alogliptin and pioglitazone is appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Important Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets are not indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings.</p><h2>Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommendations for All Patients</h3><p class="First">Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should be taken once daily and can be taken with or without food. The tablets must not be split before swallowing.</p><p>The recommended starting dose for Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>for patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg,</li>
<li>for patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg,</li>
<li>for patients on alogliptin who require additional glycemic control is 25 mg/15 mg or 25 mg/30 mg,</li>
<li>for patients on pioglitazone who require additional glycemic control is 25 mg/15 mg, 25 mg/30 mg or 25 mg/45 mg as appropriate based upon current therapy,</li>
<li>for patients switching from alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone, Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets may be initiated at the dose of alogliptin and pioglitazone based upon current therapy,</li>
<li>for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 25 mg/15 mg.</li>
</ul><p>The Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 25 mg/45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by hemoglobin A1c (A1C).</p><p>After initiation of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention as has been seen with pioglitazone (e.g., weight gain, edema and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure) <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">No dose adjustment of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥60 mL/min).</p><p>The dose of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets is 12.5 mg/15 mg, 12.5 mg/30 mg or 12.5 mg/45 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min).</p><p>Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets are not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Coadministration of pioglitazone and alogliptin 6.25 mg once daily based on individual requirements may be considered in these patients.</p><p>Because there is a need for dose adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets therapy and periodically thereafter.</p><h3>Coadministration with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of pioglitazone and gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, increases pioglitazone exposure approximately three-fold. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets is 25 mg/15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to alogliptin or pioglitazone, components of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema or severe cutaneous adverse reactions.</p><p>Do not initiate in patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Congestive Heart Failure</h3><p class="First">Consider the risks and benefits of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Patients should be advised of the characteristic symptoms of congestive heart failure and should be instructed to immediately report such symptoms<span class="Bold">.</span> If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin</span></p><p>In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome, 106 (3.9%) of patients treated with alogliptin and 89 (3.3%) of patients treated with placebo were hospitalized for congestive heart failure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, acute pancreatitis was reported in six (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and two (&lt;0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in ten (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in seven (0.3%) patients treated with placebo.</p><p>It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>After initiation of Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets, assess for other potential causes for the event and institute alternative treatment for diabetes <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].</span> Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema with another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets.</p><h3>Hepatic Effects</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone or alogliptin, although some of the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]</span>.</p><p>In glycemic control trials of alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should be initiated with caution.</p><p>Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets treatment should be interrupted and an investigation done to establish the probable cause. Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.</p><h3>Edema</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span> In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received.</p><p>Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning</span>, <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span> <span class="Italics">and Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Fractures</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care.</p><h3>Urinary Bladder Tumors</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were six (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to ten additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.59–1.72]).</p><p>Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did.</p><p>A large prospective ten year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.89–1.26]).</p><p>A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.22–2.19]).</p><p>Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the ten year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data.</p><p>Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.</p><p>Consequently, Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.</p><h3>Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First">Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets.</p><h3>Macular Edema</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.</p><p>Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of their thiazolidinedione.</p><p>Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h3>Severe and Disabling Arthralgia</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.</p><h3>Bullous Pemphigoid</h3><p class="First">Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information:</p><ul class="Disc">

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin and Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Over 1500 patients with type 2 diabetes have received alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone in four large, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials. The mean exposure to Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets was 29 weeks with more than 100 subjects treated for more than one year. The studies consisted of two placebo-controlled studies of 16 to 26 weeks in duration and two active-controlled studies of 26 weeks and 52 weeks in duration. In the Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets arm, the mean duration of diabetes was approximately six years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (54% of patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), and the mean age was 54 years (16% of patients ≥65 years of age).</p><p>In a pooled analysis of these four controlled clinical studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 65% in patients treated with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets compared to 57% treated with placebo. Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 2.5% with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets compared to 2.0% with placebo, 3.7% with pioglitazone or 1.3% with alogliptin.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in ≥4% of patients treated with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets and more frequently than in patients who received alogliptin, pioglitazone or placebo are summarized in <span class="Italics">Table 1</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Alogliptin Add-On Therapy to a Thiazolidinedione</span></p><p>In addition, in a 26 week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, patients inadequately controlled on a thiazolidinedione alone or in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea were treated with add-on alogliptin therapy or placebo; the adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients and more frequently than in patients who received placebo was influenza (alogliptin, 5.5%; placebo, 4.1%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>In a 26 week, placebo-controlled factorial study with alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone on background therapy with metformin, the incidence of subjects reporting hypoglycemia was 0.8%, 0% and 3.8% for alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg, respectively; 2.3% for alogliptin 25 mg; 4.7%, 0.8% and 0.8% for pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg, respectively; and 0.8% for placebo.</p><p>In a 26 week, active-controlled, double-blind study with alogliptin alone, pioglitazone alone or alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone in patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 3% on alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg, 0.6% on alogliptin 25 mg and 1.8% on pioglitazone 30 mg.</p><p>In a 52 week, active-controlled, double-blind study of alogliptin as add-on therapy to the combination of pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin compared to the titration of pioglitazone 30 mg to 45 mg and metformin, the incidence of subjects reporting hypoglycemia was 4.5% in the alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin group versus 1.5% in the pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin group.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin</span></p><p>A total of 14,778 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in 14 randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials of whom 9052 subjects were treated with alogliptin, 3469 subjects were treated with placebo and 2257 were treated with an active comparator.

These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin selectively binds to and inhibits DPP-4 but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pioglitazone</span></p><p>Pharmacologic studies indicate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue while inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. Unlike sulfonylureas, pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin- responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><p>In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.</p><p>Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin and Pioglitazone</span></p><p>In a 26 week, randomized, active-controlled study, patients with type 2 diabetes received alogliptin 25 mg coadministered with pioglitazone 30 mg, alogliptin 12.5 mg coadministered with pioglitazone 30 mg, alogliptin 25 mg alone or pioglitazone 30 mg alone.

A total of 9% of patients who were receiving alogliptin 25 mg and 12% of patients receiving placebo required glycemic rescue.</p><p>The improvement in A1C was not affected by gender, age, baseline BMI or baseline pioglitazone dose. The mean increase in body weight was similar between alogliptin and placebo when given in combination with pioglitazone. Lipid effects were neutral.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Safety Trial</span></p><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial (EXAMINE) was conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular risk of alogliptin. The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between alogliptin (N=2701) and placebo (N=2679) when added to standard of care therapies for diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD). The trial was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued.</p><p>Eligible patients were adults with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control at baseline (e.g., HbA1c &gt;6.5%) and had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome event (e.g., acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) 15 to 90 days prior to randomization. The dose of alogliptin was based on estimated renal function at baseline per dosage and administration recommendations <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>. The average time between an acute coronary syndrome event and randomization was approximately 48 days.</p><p>The mean age of the population was 61 years. Most patients were male (68%), Caucasian (73%), and were recruited from outside of the United States (86%). Asian and Black patients contributed 20% and 4% of the total population, respectively. At the time of randomization patients had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for approximately 9 years, 87% had a prior myocardial infarction and 14% were current smokers. Hypertension (83%) and renal impairment (27% with an eGFR ≤60 ml/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) were prevalent co-morbid conditions. Use of medications to treat diabetes (e.g., metformin 73%, sulfonylurea 54%, insulin 41%), and ASCVD (e.g., statin 94%, aspirin 93%, renin-angiotensin system blocker 88%, beta-blocker 87%) was similar between patients randomized to alogliptin and placebo at baseline. During the trial, medications to treat diabetes and ASCVD could be adjusted to ensure care for these conditions adhered to standard of care recommendations set by local practice guidelines.</p><p>The primary endpoint in EXAMINE was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke. The study was designed to exclude a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. The median exposure to study drug was 526 days and 95% of the patients were followed to study completion or death.</p><p>Table 14 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary MACE endpoint. The upper bound of the confidence interval was 1.16 and excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3.</p><p>The Kaplan-Meier based cumulative event probability is presented in Figure 4 for the time to first occurrence of the primary MACE composite endpoint by treatment arm. The curves for placebo and alogliptin overlap throughout the duration of the study. The observed incidence of MACE was highest within the first 60 days after randomization in both treatment arms (14.8 MACE per 100 PY), decreased from day 60 to the end of the first year (8.4 per 100 PY) and was lowest after one year of follow-up (5.2 per 100 PY).</p><p>The rate of all cause death was similar between treatment arms with 153 (3.6 per 100 PY) recorded among patients randomized to alogliptin and 173 (4.1 per 100 PY) among patients randomized to placebo. A total of 112 deaths (2.9 per 100 PY) among patients on alogliptin and 130 among patients on placebo (3.5 per 100 PY) were adjudicated as cardiovascular deaths.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Tablets are available in the following strengths and packages:</p><p>25 mg/15 mg tablet: yellow, round, biconvex and film-coated with both "A/P" and "25/15" printed on one side, available in:</p><p>25 mg/30 mg tablet: peach, round, biconvex and film-coated with both "A/P" and "25/30" printed on one side, available in:</p><p>25 mg/45 mg tablet: red, round, biconvex, film-coated and with both "A/P" and "25/45" printed on one side, available in:</p><p>12.5 mg/15 mg tablet: pale yellow, round, biconvex and film-coated with both "A/P" and "12.5/15" printed on one side, available in:</p><p>12.5 mg/30 mg tablet: pale peach, round, biconvex and film-coated with both "A/P" and "12.5/30" printed on one side, available in:</p><p>12.5 mg/45 mg tablet: pale red, round, biconvex and film-coated with both "A/P" and "12.5/45" printed on one side, available in:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
