</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for this Medicine</h2><p>Androgens are male hormones. Some androgens are naturally produced in the body and are necessary for the normal sexual development of males.</p><p>Androgens are used for several reasons, such as:</p><ul>
<li>To replace the hormone when the body is unable to produce enough on its own.</li>
<li>To stimulate the beginning of puberty in certain boys who are late starting puberty naturally.</li>
<li>To treat certain types of breast cancer in females.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, some of these medicines may be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Androgens are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using this Medicine</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Androgens may cause children to stop growing. In addition, androgens may make male children develop too fast sexually and may cause male-like changes in female children</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>When older male patients are treated with androgens, they may have an increased risk of enlarged prostate (a male gland) or their existing prostate cancer may get worse. For these reasons, a prostate examination and a blood test to check for prostate cancer is often done before androgens are prescribed for men over 50 years of age. These examinations may be repeated during treatment.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Androgens are not recommended during pregnancy. When given to pregnant women, the medicine has caused male features to develop in female babies.</p><h3>Breast Feeding</h3><p>Use is not recommended in nursing mothers, since androgens may pass into the breast milk and may cause unwanted effects in the nursing baby, such as premature (too early) sexual development in males and development of male features in female babies.</p><h3>Interactions with Medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with a medication in this class or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
<li>Simvastatin</li>
</ul><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Acenocoumarol</li>
<li>Anisindione</li>
<li>Atorvastatin</li>
<li>Bupropion</li>
<li>Dicumarol</li>
<li>Fluvastatin</li>
<li>Lovastatin</li>
<li>Paclitaxel</li>
<li>Paclitaxel Protein-Bound</li>
<li>Pexidartinib</li>
<li>Phenindione</li>
<li>Phenprocoumon</li>
<li>Warfarin</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with Food/Tobacco/Alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other Medical Problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Breast cancer (in males) or</li>
<li>Prostate cancer—Androgens can cause growth of these tumors.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Breast cancer (in females)—Androgens may cause high calcium levels in the blood to become worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes)—Androgens can increase or decrease blood sugar levels. Careful monitoring of blood glucose should be done.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Edema (swelling of face, hands, feet, or lower legs) or</li>
<li>Kidney disease or</li>
<li>Liver disease—These conditions can be worsened by the fluid retention (keeping too much water in the body) that can be caused by androgens. Also, liver disease can prevent the body from removing the medicine from the bloodstream as fast as it normally would. This could increase the chance of side effects occurring</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Enlarged prostate—Androgens can cause further enlargement of the prostate.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Heart or blood vessel disease—Androgens can make these conditions worse because androgens may increase blood cholesterol levels. Also, androgens can cause fluid retention (keeping too much water in the body), which also can worsen heart or blood vessel disease.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of this Medicine</h2><p><i>Take this medicine only as directed. Do not take more of it and do not take it more often than your doctor ordered</i> . Doing so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>There are two types of testosterone skin patches. The matrix-type is applied to skin of the scrotum. The reservoir-type is never applied to the skin of the scrotum. It is applied to other parts of the body. Be sure you know which type you are using so that you will apply it properly. These skin patches come with patient directions. Read them carefully before using the patch.</p><p>For patients taking <i>fluoxymesterone</i> or <i>methyltestosterone</i>:</p><ul>
<li>Take this medicine with food to lessen possible stomach upset, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</li>
</ul><p>For patients using the <i>matrix-type skin patch of testosterone</i> <i>(Testoderm or Testoderm with Adhesives)</i>:</p><ul>
<li>You must apply the patch to the scrotum because the medicine easily passes into your body at this area. Other areas of your skin are too thick for the medicine to work properly.</li>
<li>Wash and dry your hands thoroughly before and after handling the patch.
<ul>
<li>Before applying the patch:
<ul>
<li>Clean and dry your scrotum.</li>
<li>You should also dry-shave this area once a week by using a shaver only (no soap or water). To dry-shave, stretch the skin of your scrotum with your fingers. Use short gentle strokes with no pressure on the razor to remove the hair. Do not use shaving cream or hair-removing creams (e.g., Nair).</li>
<li>You may sit with your legs apart or stand while applying the patch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To apply the patch:
<ul>
<li>Open the wrapper containing the patch at the point shown on the package.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the patch from its protective plastic liner by peeling the patch from the liner starting at the corner.</li>
<li>Warm your scrotum for a few seconds before applying the patch to achieve the best results. Stretch the skin of your scrotum gently to remove the folds by pulling the penis up and to the side. Another way is to pull your scrotum down. Use your first and middle fingers to stretch the skin of your scrotum.</li>
<li>Place the shiny side of the patch onto the warm stretched skin of your scrotum.</li>
<li>Press the shiny side of the patch firmly in place with the palm of your hand for about 10 seconds. Make sure there is good contact, especially around the edges. The patch should stick to your scrotum and show the natural wrinkles of your scrotum.</li>
<li>Put on comfortable, close-fitting briefs (underwear) after applying the patch.</li>
<li>If a patch becomes loose or falls off, you may reapply it or discard it and apply a new patch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To remove the skin patch:
<ul>
<li>Gently peel the patch from the skin.</li>
<li>You may reuse the patch after removing it for swimming, bathing, showering, or sexual activity. First, remove the patch and place the shiny (sticky) side up on a counter. Before you reapply the patch, be sure the skin on your scrotum is dry. Then, follow the directions to reapply the patch.</li>
<li>When the wearing period is over, fold the patch in half with the sticky sides together. Place the folded, used patch in its protective pouch or in aluminum foil. Be sure to throw it away out of the reach of children and pets.</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Side Effects of this Medicine</h2><p>Discuss these possible effects with your doctor:</p><p>Tumors of the liver, liver cancer, or peliosis hepatis (a form of liver disease) have occurred during long-term, high-dose therapy with androgens. Although these effects are rare, they can be very serious and may cause death.</p><p>Androgens can stimulate existing prostate cancer in men who already have it but have not yet been diagnosed. Also, the prostate (a male gland) may become enlarged. Enlargement of the prostate does not mean that cancer will develop. If enlargement occurs and you have difficulty in urinating, it is a good idea to be checked by your doctor.</p><p>When androgens are used in women, especially in high doses, male-like changes may occur, such as hoarseness or deepening of the voice, unnatural hair growth, or unusual hair loss. Most of these changes will go away if the medicine is stopped as soon as the changes are noticed. However, some changes, such as voice changes or enlarged clitoris, may not go away.</p><p>When androgens are used in high doses in males, they interfere with the production of sperm. This effect is usually temporary and only happens during the time you are taking the medicine. However, discuss this possible effect with your doctor if you are planning on having children.</p><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.</p><p><i>Check with your doctor immediately</i> if any of the following side effects occur:</p><p><i>More common</i></p><p><i>For females only</i></p><p>These symptoms may occur in females whose male sexual partner uses a scrotal patch.</p><ul>
