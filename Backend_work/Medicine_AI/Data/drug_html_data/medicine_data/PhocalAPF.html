</ul><p class="First">easy interproximal therapy</p><h2>INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE</h2><h3>Purpose and Indications</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Phocal</span> disks are topical delivery vehicles designed to fluoridate interproximal tooth surfaces. This action aids in the prevention of dental caries on intact surfaces, arrests progress on surfaces with incipient carious lesions and enhances remineralization. <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> disks are also effective at tooth restoration margins and furcations.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Phocal</span> disks are to be applied only by dental professionals at selected sites to achieve the desired benefits.</li>
</ul><h2>Description</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>The patented <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> topical fluoride disks are provided in two forms:
<dl class="Disc">
<dt>-</dt>
<dd>pink acidulated phosphate fluoride Apf disks</dd>
<dt>-</dt>
<dd>yellow non-acidic sodium fluoride pHn disks</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>These thin, round disks contain 1.23% fluoride ions. Once positioned interproximally they rapidly expand, soften into a gel and release fluoride for approximately 10 minutes before biodegrading. This release period can be increased as explained in the Directions for Use.</li>
<li>Each <span class="Bold">Phocal APF</span> disk contains 0.103mg of sodium fluoride and 0.009mg of hydrogen fluoride in a matrix of FD&amp;C red 3, gum arabic, gelatin (of marine origin), propolis wax, phosphoric acid, sodium benzoate and water. These disks induce an optimized low pH environment that cleans and etches tooth surfaces and facilitates fluoride penetration and stimulates remineralization.</li>
<li>Each <span class="Bold">Phocal pHn</span> disk contains 0.122mg of sodium fluoride in a matrix of gum arabic, gelatin (of marine origin), propolis wax, sodium benzoate and water. These disks are less acidic than the <span class="Bold">Phocal APF</span> disks and will not etch ceramic crowns or tooth-colored restorations while inducing fluoridation and remineralization.</li>
</ul><h2>Directions for Use</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>There are different methods for the placement of <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> fluoride disks.</li>
<li>The choice of placement method and <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> type is subject to the discretion of the dental professional and is usually dependent upon the nature of the site being treated, interproximal tightness and the strength and type of adjacent restorations and teeth.</li>
<li>Prior to treatment using either of the placement methods below, all debris and calculus should be removed from the selected site(s) and the site(s) should remain dry during placement. Premature wetting softens the disks and can compromise correct interproximal placement.</li>
</ul><h3>Method 1 – Insertion of flat Phocal disks</h3><p class="First">Recommended for anterior teeth and where spacing allows.</p><h3>Method 2 – Insertion of folded Phocal disks</h3><p class="First">Recommended for posterior teeth and where spacing is restrictive.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>In rare cases nickel titanium springs, elastic O-rings or Maxian strips can be used to separate teeth but this is usually a slower process which requires two visits: one for separation and then one for disk placement.</li>
<li>To accelerate the initial reactions of <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> disks a curing light can be applied for 3-10 seconds.</li>
<li>To extend the fluoride release time period, a varnish can be applied to partially cover the interproximal site or disk occlusally, buccally or/and lingually. However the disk should not be completely coated with varnish.</li>
<li>To shorten the release time the disks can be removed using an appropriate instrument, dental floss and/or aspiration.</li>
<li>If <span class="Bold">Phocal APF</span> is used, in order to guard against possible etching of porcelain crowns or tooth-colored restorations, a protective matrix should be used. With <span class="Bold">Phocal pHn</span> there is no risk of etching.</li>
<li>Advise the patient not to eat, drink or rinse for at least 30 minutes after treatment.</li>
<li>If multiple applications are necessary, treat no more than 8 sites at a time and delay subsequent <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> applications for at least a day.</li>
<li>If deemed necessary, patients may be recalled at intervals of 2 to 12 months for repeated treatments.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Phocal</span> disks are versatile, and with specific gentle moisturization they can be trimmed, rolled, or folded to fit other inaccessible areas such as furcations.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>In rare cases, sensitivity or adverse reactions may be experienced. In such cases immediately remove the disks while preventing swallowing and refer the patient to a physician.</li>
<li>Patients less than 12 years old and patients with special needs should remain under professional supervision until the <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> disks have biodegraded or have been removed.</li>
<li>The disks are not intended for systemic ingestion and should be kept out of children's reach. If more than 20 disks are accidently swallowed, seek immediate medical assistance.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Phocal</span> should not be applied in sites with: gingival inflammation, immediately prior to or after oral soft tissue surgery and in cases of known allergies to any of the <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> ingredients.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Phocal</span> is to be sold as unbroken boxes with all disks sealed within the blister packs and is to be used for application in the dental office by professionals only.</li>
<li>When <span class="Bold">Phocal</span> treatment is utilized, routine systemic and topical administrations of fluoride should be suspended during the day of application.</li>
<li>Since the propolis wax and gelatin used in Phocal disks are natural products, they may occasionally interact to produce brownish spots or discoloration. This does not indicate that there is any hazard or danger in using the product.</li>
<li>Recommended storage temperatures are 40°F-75°F (5°C-25°C).</li>
