Percentages as reported with combination product. Also see individual agents.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Dysgeusia (3% to 5%), xerostomia (3% to 5%)</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Local ocular hypersensitivity reaction (3% to 5%)</p><p>Ophthalmic: Blurred vision (3% to 5%), eye irritation (3% to 5%)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse events:</i></b></p><p>• Acid-base disturbances: Brinzolamide is absorbed systemically following topical administration; acid-base disturbances reported with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may occur following topical application.</p><p>• Bacterial keratitis: Inadvertent contamination of multiple-dose ophthalmic solutions has caused bacterial keratitis.</p><p>• CNS effects: May cause CNS depression and/or blurred vision, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).</p><p>• Sulfonamide (“sulfa”) allergy: The FDA-approved and Health Canada-approved product labelings for many medications containing a sulfonamide chemical group includes a broad contraindication in patients with a prior allergic reaction to sulfonamides. There is a potential for cross-reactivity between members of a specific class (eg, two antibiotic sulfonamides). However, concerns for cross-reactivity have previously extended to all compounds containing the sulfonamide structure (SO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>). An expanded understanding of allergic mechanisms indicates cross-reactivity between antibiotic sulfonamides and nonantibiotic sulfonamides may not occur or at the very least this potential is extremely low (Brackett 2004; Johnson 2005; Slatore 2004; Tornero 2004). In particular, mechanisms of cross-reaction due to antibody production (anaphylaxis) are unlikely to occur with nonantibiotic sulfonamides. T-cell-mediated (type IV) reactions (eg, maculopapular rash) are less well understood and it is not possible to completely exclude this potential based on current insights. In cases where prior reactions were severe (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis), some clinicians choose to avoid exposure to these classes.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acute angle-closure (narrow-angle) glaucoma: Use has not been studied in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with coronary insufficiency or severe or unstable cardiovascular disease.</p><p>• Cerebrovascular insufficiency: Use with caution in patients with cerebral insufficiency; may precipitate or aggravate symptoms.</p><p>• Corneal endothelium: Use with caution in patients with low endothelial cell counts; may be at increased risk of corneal edema.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; has not been evaluated in this population.</p><p>• Orthostatic hypotension: Use with caution in patients with orthostatic hypotension; may precipitate or aggravate symptoms.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment; use has not been evaluated in this population.
