Carefully screen for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides prior to administration.</p><p>• Bronchospasm: Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, exertional dyspnea, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) has been reported; manage as medically appropriate.</p><p>• Hemoptysis: Hemoptysis has been reported; manage as medically appropriate.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction) has been reported; manage as medically appropriate.</p><p>• Nephrotoxicity: Nephrotoxicity has been reported with aminoglycosides; use with caution in patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction.</p><p>• Neuromuscular blockade: May cause neuromuscular blockade and aggravate muscle weakness. Neuromuscular blockade is reversible but may require treatment (eg, administration of calcium salts, mechanical respiratory assistance).</p><p>• Ototoxicity: Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, vertigo) has been reported. Use with caution in patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction; if ototoxicity occurs, manage as medically appropriate.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns</b></i><i><b>:</b></i></p><p>• Neuromuscular disorders: Use with caution in patients with neuromuscular disorders, including myasthenia gravis; patients with neuromuscular disorders were not studied.</p><p>• Pulmonary disease: Exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) has been reported; manage as medically appropriate.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Aminoglycosides may cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant woman. Systemic absorption of amikacin following oral inhalation is expected to be low compared to intravenous administration; however, systemic exposure was associated with total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received a different aminoglycoside during pregnancy.</p><p>Refer to the Amikacin (Systemic) monograph for details.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat a type of bacterial infection.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
