Blood clots are more likely when you are bedridden and you cannot move around.</p><p>It is not known if Bevyxxa is safe and effective in children or in people with artificial heart valves.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Because Bevyxxa keeps your blood from clotting, <b>this medicine can make it easier for you to bleed.</b> Contact your doctor or seek emergency medical attention if you have unusual bruising or any bleeding that will not stop.</p><p>Tell your doctor about all other medicines you use. Many drugs can further increase your risk of bleeding while you are taking Bevyxxa.</p><p>Bevyxxa can cause a very serious blood clot around your spinal cord if you undergo a spinal tap or receive spinal anesthesia (epidural), especially if you have a genetic spinal defect, if you have a spinal catheter in place, if you have a history of spinal surgery or repeated spinal taps, or if you are also using other drugs that can affect blood clotting. This type of blood clot can lead to long-term or permanent paralysis.</p><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>symptoms of a spinal cord blood clot</b> such as back pain, numbness or muscle weakness in your lower body, or loss of bladder or bowel control.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use Bevyxxa if you are allergic to betrixaban, or if you have active or uncontrolled bleeding.</p><p>Bevyxxa may cause you to bleed more easily, especially if you have kidney disease or you use other medicines such as:</p><ul>
