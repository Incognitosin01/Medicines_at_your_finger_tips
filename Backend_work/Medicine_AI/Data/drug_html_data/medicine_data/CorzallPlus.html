Antitussive / Decongestant / Antihistamine</p><p><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION</span><br/>
Each teaspoonful (5 mL) for oral administration contains:<br/>
Carbetapentane Citrate..... 20 mg<br/>
Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride..... 30 mg<br/>
Pyrilamine Maleate..... 7.5 mg</p><p>Inactive ingredients: Citric Acid, Fruit Gum Flavor, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Purified Water, Sodium Citrate,<br/>
Sodium Saccharin, Sorbitol</p><p>Carbetapentane Citrate (1-Phenylcyclopentanecarboxylic acid, 2-(2-diethylaminoethoxy) ethyl ester citrate) is a<br/>
white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water and chloroform. Its structure is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride (Benzenemethanol, Î±-[1-(methylamino)ethyl]-, [S-(R*,R*)-, hydrochloride) is the<br/>
hydrochloride of pseudoephedrine, a naturally occurring dextrorotatory stereoisomer of ephedrine. Its structure is<br/>
as follows:</p><p></p><p>Pyrilamine Maleate is an antihistamine having the chemical name 2-[[2-Dimethylamino)ethyl] (<span class="Italics">p</span>-methoxybenzyl)amino]<br/>
pyridine maleate (1:1). Its structural formula is as follows:</p><p></p><h2>Corzall Plus - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Antitussive, decongestant, and antihistaminic actions.</p><p>Carbetapentane citrate is a centrally acting non-narcotic antitussive. Carbetapentane citrate has atropine-like and local<br/>
anesthetic actions, as well as temporarily controls and suppresses the cough reflex by selective depression of the<br/>
medullary cough center. It has no significant analgesic or sedative properties, does not depress respiration or predispose<br/>
to addiction with usual doses.</p><p>Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is an oral sympathomimetic amine that acts as a decongestant to respiratory tract<br/>
mucous membranes. While is vasoconstrictor action is similar to that of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine has less pressor<br/>
effect in normotensive adults. Serum half-life for pseudoephedrine is 6 to 8 hours. Acidic urine is associated with faster<br/>
elimination of the drug. About one-half of the administered drug is excreted in the urine.</p><p>Pyrilamine maleate is a histamine antagonist, specifically an H<span class="Sub">1</span> receptor-blocking agent belonging to the alkylamine<br/>
class of antihistamines. Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for receptor sites on effector cells. Pyrilamine<br/>
also has anticholinergic (drying) and sedative effects. Among the antihistaminic effects, it antagonizes the allergic<br/>
response (vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, increased mucus secretion) of nasal tissue. Pyrilamine is well<br/>
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentration after a single, oral dose of 4 mg reached in 5<br/>
hours; urinary excretion is the major route of elimination, mostly as products of biodegradation; the liver is assumed to<br/>
be the main site of metabolic transformation.<br/></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Corzall Plus</h2><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to any of its ingredients. Sympathomimetic amines are contraindicated<br/>
in patients with severe hypertension, severe coronary heart disease and patients on monoamine oxidase (MAO)<br/>
inhibitor therapy. Antihistamines are contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, peptic<br/>
ulcer, and during an asthma attack.<br/></p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Sympathomimetic amines should be used judiciously and sparingly in patients with hypertension, diabetes,<br/>
ischemic heart disease, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure, or prostatic hypertrophy.<br/>
(See <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span>). Sympathomimetic amines may produce CNS stimulation with convulsions<br/>
or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension. The elderly (60 years and older) are more likely<br/>
to exhibit adverse reactions.</p><p>Antihistamines may cause hyperexcitability, especially in children. At doses higher than the recommended<br/>
doses, nervousness, dizziness or sleeplessness may occur. Do not exceed recommended dosage.<br/></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">General: There are studies which demonstrate that carbetapentane has antitussive activity which may suppress<br/>
or modify cough. Before prescribing medication to suppress or modify cough, identify and provide therapy for the<br/>
underlying cause of the cough and take caution that modification of cough does not increase the risk of clinical<br/>
or physiologic complications.</p><p>Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart disease, asthma, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular<br/>
pressure, diabetes mellitus, and prostatic hypertrophy.<br/></p><h2>Information for patients:</h2><p class="First">Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking this product. Patients sensitive to<br/>
antihistamines may experience moderate to severe drowsiness. Patients sensitive to<br/>
sympathomimetics may note mild CNS stimulation.<br/></p><h2>Drug Interactions:</h2><p class="First">Carbetapentane citrate should not be used in patients receiving MAO inhibitors, including 14 days after<br/>
stopping the MAOI drug. The use of Carbetapentane citrate may result in additive CNS depressant<br/>
effects when coadministered with alcohol, antihistamines, psychotropics or other drugs that produce<br/>
CNS depression.</p><p>Antihistamines may enhance the effect of tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, alcohol, and other CNS<br/>
depressants. MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic effects of antihistamines.</p><p>Sympathomimetic amines may reduce the antihypertensive effects of reserpine, veratrum alkaloids,<br/>
methyldopa, and mecamylamine. Effects of sympathomimetics are increased with MAO inhibitors and<br/>
beta-adrenergic blockers.<br/></p><h2>Pregnancy:</h2><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is not<br/>
known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect<br/>
reproductive capacity. Give to pregnant women only if clearly needed.</p><h2>Nursing Mothers:</h2><p class="First">It is not known if the drugs in this product are excreted in human milk. Since many drugs may<br/>
be excreted into human milk and because of the potential for serious side effects in the nursing<br/>
infant, this product should only be given to nursing mothers if clearly needed.<br/></p><h2>Pediatric use:</h2><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of six have not been established.<br/>
Product not intended for administration for children 6 years of age and under.<br/></p><h2>Geriatric use:</h2><p class="First">The elderly (60 years and older) are more likely to have adverse reactions to sympathomimetics.<br/>
Overdosage of sympathomimetics in this age group may cause hallucinations, convulsions, CNS<br/>
depression and death.<br/></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse effects associated with Carbetapentane citrate are rare, but nausea and/or other gastrointestinal<br/>
disturbances sometimes occur.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antihistamines:</span> Sedation, dizziness, diplopia, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, nervousness,<br/>
nausea, anorexia, heartburn, weakness, polyuria, and dysuria, and rarely, excitability in children. Urinary<br/>
retention may occur in patients with prostatic hypertrophy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Sympathomimetic Amines:</span> Convulsions, CNS stimulation, cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory difficulties,<br/>
increased heart rate or blood pressure, hallucinations, tremors, nervousness, insomnia, pallor and dysuria.<br/></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The signs, symptoms and treatment described below are those of H<span class="Sub">1</span> antihistamine, pseudoephedrine<br/>
and carbetapentane.</p><p><span class="Bold">Symptoms:</span> Should antihistamine effects predominate, central action constitutes the greatest danger.<br/>
In the small child, predominate symptoms are excitation, hallucination, ataxia, incoordination, tremors,<br/>
flushed face and fever. Convulsions, fixed and dilated pupils, coma, and death may occur in severe<br/>
cases. In the adult, fever and flushing are uncommon; excitement leading to convulsions and postictal<br/>
depression is often preceded by drowsiness and coma. Respiration is usually not seriously depressed;<br/>
blood pressure is usually stable.</p><p>Should sympathomimetic symptoms predominate, central effects include restlessness, dizziness, tremor,<br/>
hyperactive reflexes, talkativeness, irritability, and insomnia. Cardiovascular and renal effects include<br/>
difficulty in micturition, headache, flushing, palpitation, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension with subsequent<br/>
hypotension and circulatory collapse. Gastrointestinal effects include dry mouth, metallic taste, anorexia,<br/>
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatments:</span><br/>
a) Evacuate stomach as condition warrants. Activated charcoal may be useful.<br/>
b) Maintain a non-stimulating environment.<br/>
c) Monitor cardiovascular status.<br/>
d) Do not give stimulants.<br/>
e) Reduce fever with sponging.<br/>
f) Use sedatives or anticonvulsants to control CNS excitation, and convulsions.<br/>
g) Physostigmine may reverse anti-cholinergic symptoms.<br/>
h) Ammonium Chloride may acidify the urine to increase urinary excretion of pseudoepehdrine.<br/>
i) Further care is symptomatic and supportive.<br/></p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION*</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and children 12 years of age and older:</span><br/>
