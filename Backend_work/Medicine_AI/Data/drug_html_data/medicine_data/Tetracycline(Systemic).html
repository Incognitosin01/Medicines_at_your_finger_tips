Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of intracranial hypertension are at greater risk. Concomitant use of isotretinoin (known to cause pseudotumor cerebri [PTC]) and tetracycline should be avoided. Intracranial hypertension typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment; however, permanent visual loss is possible. If visual symptoms develop during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug discontinuation; monitor patients until they stabilize.</p><p>• Photosensitivity: May cause photosensitivity; discontinue if skin erythema occurs. Use skin protection and avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight; do not use tanning equipment.</p><p>• Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including <i>Clostridioides</i> (formerly <i>Clostridium</i>) <i>difficile</i>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed &gt;2 months postantibiotic treatment.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely; risk may be increased in patients with preexisting hepatic or renal impairment.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dosage adjustment recommended.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Pediatric: May cause tissue hyperpigmentation, enamel hypoplasia, or permanent tooth discoloration; use of tetracyclines should be avoided during tooth development (children &lt;8 years of age) unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Acne: The American Academy of Dermatology acne guidelines recommend tetracycline as adjunctive treatment for moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne that are resistant to topical treatments. Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be administered with systemic antibiotic therapy (eg, tetracycline) and continued for maintenance after antibiotic course is completed (AAD [Zaenglein 2016]).</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Renal, hepatic, and hematologic function test, temperature, WBC, cultures and sensitivity, appetite, mental status</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Tetracycline crosses the placenta (Leblanc 1967). Tetracyclines accumulate in developing teeth and long tubular bones (Mylonas 2011). Permanent discoloration of teeth (yellow, gray, brown) can occur following in utero exposure and is more likely to occur following long-term or repeated exposure. The pharmacokinetics of tetracycline are not altered in pregnant patients with normal renal function (Whalley 1966; Whalley 1970). Hepatic toxicity during pregnancy, potentially associated with tetracycline use, has been reported. Pregnant women with renal disease may be more likely to develop hepatic failure with tetracycline use.</p><p>As a class, tetracyclines are generally considered second-line antibiotics in pregnant women and their use should be avoided (Mylonas 2011). Many guidelines consider use of tetracycline to be contraindicated during pregnancy, or to be a relative contraindication in pregnant women if other agents are available and appropriate for use (CDC 2020; CDC [Anderson 2013]; CDC [Workowski 2015]; HHS [OI adult 2020]; IDSA [Stevens 2014]). When systemic antibiotics are needed for acne or dermatologic conditions in pregnant women, other agents are preferred (AAD [Zaenglein 2016]; Murase 2014).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat bacterial infections.</p><p>• It is used to treat pimples (acne).</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
