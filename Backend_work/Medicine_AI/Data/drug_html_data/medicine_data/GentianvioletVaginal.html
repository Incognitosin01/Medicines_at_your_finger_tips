This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For gentian violet, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to gentian violet or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on gentian violet have been done only in adult patients, and there is no specific information comparing use of vaginal gentian violet in children with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of vaginal gentian violet in the elderly with use in other age groups, gentian violet is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than it does in younger adults.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of gentian violet</h2><p>Gentian violet usually comes with patient directions. Read them carefully before using gentian violet.</p><p>After insertion, remove the tampon from the vagina after 3 to 4 hours unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</p><p>To help clear up your infection completely, keep using gentian violet for the full time of treatment, even though your condition may have improved. Do not miss any doses.</p><p>While you are using gentian violet tampons, the use of regular (non-medicated) tampons is not recommended. They will soak up the medicine that stays in the vagina after the gentian violet tampon is taken out. During your menstrual period you should wear a minipad or sanitary napkin instead.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of gentian violet will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of gentian violet. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Vaginal medicines usually will come out of the vagina during treatment. To keep the medicine from getting on your clothing, wear a minipad or sanitary napkin.</p><p>To help clear up your infection completely and to help make sure it does not return, good health habits are also needed.</p><ul>
<li>Wear cotton panties (or panties or pantyhose with cotton crotches) instead of synthetic (for example, nylon or rayon) panties.</li>
<li>Wear only clean panties.</li>
</ul><p>If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.</p><p>Many vaginal infections are spread by having sex. A male sexual partner may carry the germs on or in his penis. While you are using gentian violet, it may be a good idea for your partner to wear a condom during sex to avoid re-infection. Also, your partner may need to be treated. Do not stop using gentian violet if you have sex during treatment.</p><p>Some women may want to use a douche before putting each dose in the vagina. Some doctors will allow the use of a vinegar and water douche or other douche. However, others do not allow any douching. If you do use a douche, do not overfill the vagina. To do so may push the douche up into the uterus and possibly cause inflammation or infection. Also, do not douche if you are pregnant since this may harm the fetus. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Gentian violet side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
