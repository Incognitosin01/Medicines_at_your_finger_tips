These medicines are used to treat infections caused by protozoa (tiny, one-celled animals). Iodoquinol is used most often in the treatment of an intestinal infection called amebiasis. However, it may be used to treat other types of infection as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Iodoquinol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using iodoquinol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
