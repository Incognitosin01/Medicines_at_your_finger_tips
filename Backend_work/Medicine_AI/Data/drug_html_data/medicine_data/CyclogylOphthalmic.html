</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Cyclogyl</h2><p>Ophthalmic atropine, homatropine, and scopolamine are used to dilate (enlarge) the pupil of the eye. They are used before eye examinations, before and after eye surgery, and to treat certain eye conditions, such as uveitis or posterior synechiae.</p><p>These medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Cyclogyl</h2><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Infants and young children and children with blond hair or blue eyes may be especially sensitive to the effects of atropine, homatropine, or scopolamine. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment . Children should use a lower strength of this medicine.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Elderly people are especially sensitive to the effects of atropine, homatropine, or scopolamine. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p>Studies on effects in pregnancy have not been done in either humans or animals. However, these medicines may be absorbed into the body.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>These medicines may be absorbed into the body. Atropine passes into the breast milk in very small amounts and may cause side effects, such as fast pulse, fever, or dry skin, in babies of nursing mothers using ophthalmic atropine. It is not known whether homatropine or scopolamine passes into breast milk. Although most medicines pass into breast milk in small amounts, many of them may be used safely while breast-feeding. Mothers who are using one of these medicines and who wish to breast-feed should discuss this with their doctor.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Brain damage (in children) or</li>
<li>Down's syndrome (Trisomy21) (in children and adults) or</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Cyclogyl</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain atropine, homatropine, and scopolamine.  It may not be specific to Cyclogyl. Please read with care.</b></p><p>To use the ophthalmic solution <i>(eye drops) form</i> of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 2 or 3 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.</li>
<li>Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them. If you are using the eye drops for an infant or child, be sure to wash his or her hands immediately afterwards also, and do not let any of the medicine get in his or her mouth. In addition, wipe off any medicine that may have accidentally gotten on the infant or child, including his or her face or eyelids.</li>
<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed.</li>
</ul><p>To use the <i>ointment form</i> of this medicine:</p><ul>
<li>First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Squeeze a thin strip of ointment into this space. A 1/3- to Â½;-cm (approximately â…›-inch in infants and young children and Â¼-inch in older children and adults) strip of ointment is usually enough, unless you have been told by your doctor to use a different amount. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.</li>
<li>Immediately after using the eye ointment, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them. If you are using the eye ointment for an infant or child, be sure to wash his or her hands immediately afterwards also, and do not let any of the medicine get in his or her mouth. In addition, wipe off any medicine that may have accidentally gotten on the infant or child, including his or her face or eyelids.</li>
<li>To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). After using the eye ointment, wipe the tip of the ointment tube with a clean tissue and keep the tube tightly closed.</li>
</ul><p><i>Use this medicine only as directed</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of too much medicine being absorbed into the body and the chance of side effects. <i>This is especially important when this medicine is used in infants and children, since overdose is very dangerous in infants and children</i>.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>For atropine
