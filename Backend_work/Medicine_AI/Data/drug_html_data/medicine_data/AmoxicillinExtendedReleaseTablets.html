</ul><h2>1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis</span></p><p>Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes)</span> in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older.</p><p>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis</span></p><p>The recommended dose of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is 775 mg once daily taken within 1 hour of finishing a meal for 10 days. The full 10-day course of therapy should be completed for effective treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes.</span></p><p>Do not chew or crush tablet.</p><h2>3. DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS</h2><p class="First">775 mg blue film-coated, oval-shaped tablets printed with “MB-111” on one side in black edible ink.</p><h2>4. CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to amoxicillin or to other drugs in the same class or patients who have demonstrated anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactams.</p><h2>5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h2><h3>Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><p><span class="Bold">Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. Oxygen, intravenous steroids, and airway management, including intubation, should also be administered as indicated.</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Superinfections</h3><p class="First">The possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>Mononucleosis Rash</h3><p class="First">A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, ampicillin-class antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing amoxicillin in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or treating prophylactically is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>False-Positive Urinary Glucose Tests</h3><p class="First">High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest<span class="Sup">®</span>, Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix<span class="Sup">®</span>) be used.</p><h2>6. ADVERSE REACTIONS</h2><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><h3>Clinical Study Experience</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis</span></p><p>In a controlled Phase 3 trial, 302 adult and pediatric patients (≥12 years) were treated with Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets 775 mg once-daily for 10 days and 306 adult and pediatric patients (≥12 years) were treated with penicillin VK 250 mg QID for 10 days.</p><p>In this clinical trial, the majority of treatment-emergent adverse reactions were of a mild and transient nature with similar frequency reported in both treatment groups. Discontinuation due to drug-related treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurred in 1.3% of the Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets -treated patients and 3.3% of the penicillin VK-treated patients.</p><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥1%) which were suspected or probably drug-related are shown in Table 1.</p><p class="First Footnote">*Presented in decreasing order of frequency in the Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets column within each system organ class.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions for Other Amoxicillin Products</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been reported for other products containing amoxicillin:</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Infections and Infestations</span>: Mucocutaneous candidiasis.</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Gastrointestinal</span>: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis.</p><p>Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment.</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">Hypersensitivity Reactions</span>: Anaphylaxis (See Warnings and Precautions).</p><p>Serum sickness like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis and urticaria have been reported. (NOTE: These hypersensitivity reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to amoxicillin therapy.)</p><p><span class="Italics">Liver:</span> A moderate rise in AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction including cholestatic jaundice, hepatic cholestasis and acute cytolytic hepatitis have been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hemic and Lymphatic Systems:</span> Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.</p><p><span class="Italics">Central Nervous System:</span> Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, behavioral changes, and/or dizziness have been reported rarely.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal:</span> Crystalluria has also been reported.</p><p><span class="Italics">Miscellaneous:</span> Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been rarely reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.</p><h2>7. DRUG INTERACTIONS</h2><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been evaluated.</p><h3>Other Antibiotics</h3><p class="First">Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.</p><h3>Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">As with other antibiotics, amoxicillin may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and potentially resulting in reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.</p><h2>8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category B.</span> Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (12.5 and 25 times the human dose in mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pigs showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older have been established based on results of a clinical trial that included adults and pediatric patients (12 years and older). [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies</span> (14)] Sixty-three (21%) of the study participants were pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. There were no significant differences in treatment response or adverse reactions from adults.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets in pediatric patients younger than 12 years has not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies with Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets did not include a sufficient number of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experiences with amoxicillin have not yet identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets have not been studied in patients with renal impairment; however, a reduction of amoxicillin dose is generally recommended for patients with severe renal impairment. Therefore, Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min) or patients on hemodialysis.</p><h2>10. OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">In case of overdose, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. If the overdose is very recent and there is no contraindication, an attempt at emesis or other means of removal of drug from the stomach may be performed. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms and do not require gastric emptying.</p><p>Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin.</p><p>Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria.</p><p>Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis.</p><p>For additional information about overdose treatment, call a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).</p><h2>11. DESCRIPTION</h2><p class="First">Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets for oral administration are provided as blue film-coated, oval shaped tablets that contain 775 mg of amoxicillin as the trihydrate and are printed with ”MB-111” on one side in black edible ink.</p><p>Amoxicillin is a semi-synthetic antibiotic, an analog of ampicillin, with bactericidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.</p><p>Chemically, amoxicillin is (2 <span class="Italics">S</span>,5 <span class="Italics">R</span>,6 <span class="Italics">R</span>)-6-[(<span class="Italics">R</span>)-(-)-2-amino-2-(<span class="Italics">p</span>-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane-2-carboxylic acid trihydrate. Its chemical name is amoxicillin. It may be represented structurally as:</p><p>The amoxicillin molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">5</span>S·3H<span class="Sub">2</span>O, and the molecular weight is 419.45.</p><p>Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is an extended release tablet formulation consisting of three components, one immediate-release and two delayed-release, each containing amoxicillin. The three components are combined in a specific ratio to prolong the release of amoxicillin from Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets compared to immediate-release amoxicillin.</p><p>Each tablet contains amoxicillin, crospovidone, FD&amp;C Blue #2 lake, hypromellose, hypromellose acetate succinate, iron oxide, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol 400, polyoxyl 35 castor oil, povidone, shellac, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, titanium dioxide, and triethyl citrate.</p><h2>12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin is an antibacterial drug. [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology</span> (12.4)]</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is an extended-release formulation of amoxicillin intended to provide once-daily dosing. Following the administration of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets with a low-fat meal in healthy subjects, mean amoxicillin AUC<span class="Sub">0-∞</span>, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and T<span class="Sub">max</span> values were 29.8 μg•h/mL, 6.6 μg/mL and 3.1 hours, respectively. The mean plasma concentration-time curve is shown below in Figure 1.</p><p>Figure 1. Mean Amoxicillin Plasma Concentrations Following a Single Oral Dose of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets With a Low-Fat Meal in Healthy Subjects (N=20)</p><p>Administration of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets with food decreases the rate, but not the extent of amoxicillin absorption. Compared to immediate-release amoxicillin suspension, the rate of amoxicillin absorption following administration of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets was slower, resulting in a lower C<span class="Sub">max</span> and longer T<span class="Sub">max</span>. Total amoxicillin exposure (AUC) achieved with Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is similar to that observed after oral administration of a comparable dose of immediate-release amoxicillin suspension.</p><p>Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of brain and spinal fluid, except when meninges are inflamed. Amoxicillin is approximately 20% protein bound in human serum.</p><p>Amoxicillin is primarily cleared by renal excretion. Approximately 60% of an oral dose of immediate-release amoxicillin is eliminated unchanged in urine. The half-life of amoxicillin after oral administration of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is approximately 1.5 hours, similar to that of immediate-release amoxicillin. No accumulation of amoxicillin was observed after once-daily dosing of 775 mg of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets for 7 days.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>In a study of healthy adult subjects, amoxicillin AUC was similar whereas C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased approximately 35% following the administration of lansoprazole with Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets given with food.</p><p>Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. The clinical relevance of this finding has not been evaluated.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Amoxicillin is similar to penicillin in its bacterial action against susceptible organisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts through the inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis that leads to the death of the bacteria.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Resistance</span></p><p>To date there are no known mechanisms of resistance to penicillin or amoxicillin in <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Antimicrobial Activity</span></p><p>Amoxicillin has been shown to be active <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> against isolates of the microorganism <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes</span> and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gram-Positive Bacteria:</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Streptococcus pyogenes</span></p><p>The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptibility breakpoint of amoxicillin (as determined by susceptibility tests using the class representative agents penicillin or ampicillin).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gram-Positive Bacteria:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Streptococcus</span> spp. (Group B, C, and G; Beta-hemolytic)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Susceptibility Test Methods:</span></p><p>When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens.

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted; however, the following information is available from tests on a 4:1 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate (<span class="Italics">Augmentin</span>). <span class="Italics">Augmentin</span> was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. <span class="Italics">Augmentin</span> was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival. <span class="Italics">Augmentin</span> was negative in the mouse micronucleus test, and in the dominant lethal assay in mice. Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays. In a multi-generation reproduction study in rats, no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 6 times the human dose in mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h2>14. CLINICAL STUDIES</h2><p class="First">In a randomized, parallel-group, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy study in adults and pediatrics (age ≥ 12 years) with tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes,</span> Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets 775 mg QD for 10 days was non-inferior to penicillin VK 250 mg QID for 10 days.</p><p>Using strict evaluability and microbiologic response criteria 4-8 days post-therapy, the following bacteriological eradication rates and statistical outcomes in the per-protocol (PPb) and modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populations were obtained (Table 3). The mITT population included all randomized patients with a positive throat culture for <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes</span> at baseline. The PPb population included mITT patients who had post-therapy cultures, were compliant with treatment, and didn't have major protocol violations.</p><h2>15. REFERENCES</h2><h2>16.

PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION</h2><h3>Instructions for Administration of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets</h3><p class="First">Patients should be informed that the recommended dose of Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets is 775 mg once daily taken with food for 10 days. Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets should be taken within 1 hour of finishing a meal and at approximately the same time every day. The full 10-day course of therapy should be completed for effective treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to <span class="Italics">S. pyogenes.</span> Patients should be instructed not to chew or crush the tablet. No other forms of immediate-release amoxicillin can be substituted for Amoxicillin Extended-Release Tablets.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Patients should be informed that serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported while on penicillin therapy. Patients should be questioned regarding any hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins or other allergens. Whenever such reactions occur, the patient should be instructed to contact their physician immediately. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine. Oxygen, intravenous steroids, and airway management, including intubation, should also be administered as indicated.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First">Patients should be informed that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p>AUGMENTIN is a registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline.<br/>
