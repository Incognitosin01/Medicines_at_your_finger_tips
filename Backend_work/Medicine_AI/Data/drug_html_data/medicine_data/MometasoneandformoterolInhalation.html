</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antiasthma, Anti-Inflammatory/Bronchodilator Combination</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Formoterol</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for mometasone and formoterol</h2><p>Mometasone and formoterol is a combination of two medicines that are used to treat asthma and improve lung function. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. Mometasone and formoterol will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.</p><p>Mometasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing inflammation (swelling) in the lungs that causes an asthma attack.</p><p>Formoterol belongs to the family of medicines known as adrenergic bronchodilators. Adrenergic bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p><p>Mometasone and formoterol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using mometasone and formoterol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For mometasone and formoterol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to mometasone and formoterol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mometasone and formoterol combination in children 5 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 5 years of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of mometasone and formoterol combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients with heart problems may require special caution when receiving mometasone and formoterol combination.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking mometasone and formoterol, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using mometasone and formoterol with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of mometasone and formoterol</h2><p><i>Use mometasone and formoterol only as directed</i>. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop taking mometasone and formoterol without telling your doctor. To do so may increase the chance of side effects.</p><p>Mometasone and formoterol is used with a special inhaler and usually comes with patient directions or a Medication Guide. Read the directions carefully before using mometasone and formoterol. If you do not understand the directions or you are not sure how to use the inhaler, ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you what to do.</p><p>When you use the inhaler for the first time, or if you have not used it for 5 days or longer, it may not deliver the right amount of medicine with the first puff. Before using the inhaler, prime it by spraying the medicine 4 times into the air away from the face, and shaking it well before each spray.</p><p>How to use mometasone and formoterol:</p><ul>
<li>Take the inhaler out of the carton before you use it for the first time.</li>
<li>Do not use the inhaler for mometasone and formoterol with any other medicine.</li>
<li>Remove the cap from the mouthpiece of the actuator.</li>
<li>Do not remove the canister from the actuator.</li>
<li>Prime the inhaler before use by shaking the inhaler well and then releasing 4 test sprays.</li>
<li>To inhale mometasone and formoterol, breathe out fully, trying to get as much air out of the lungs as possible. Put the mouthpiece fully into your mouth and close your lips around it. Do not block the mouthpiece with your teeth or tongue.</li>
<li>While pressing down firmly and fully on the blue top of the inhaler, breathe in through your mouth as deeply as you can until you have taken a full deep breath.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for the next puff, starting with shaking the inhaler.</li>
<li>Replace the mouthpiece cover after using the medicine.</li>
<li>Gargle and rinse your mouth with water after each dose. This will help prevent hoarseness, throat irritation, and infection in the mouth. Do not swallow the water after rinsing.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of mometasone and formoterol will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of mometasone and formoterol. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

You may need to have your eyes checked at regular visits. Be sure to keep all appointments.</p><p>Although mometasone and formoterol decreases the number of asthma episodes, it may increase the chances of a severe asthma episode when they do occur. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about any questions or concerns that you have.</p><p>You or your child should not use mometasone and formoterol if your asthma attack has already started or if you already have a severe asthma attack. Your doctor may prescribe another medicine (eg, a short-acting inhaler) for you to use in case of an acute asthma attack. Call your doctor immediately for instructions.</p><p>Do not use any other asthma medicine or medicine for breathing problems without talking to your doctor. Mometasone and formoterol should not be used with arformoterol (Brovana®), budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort®), formoterol (Foradil®, Perforomist®), or salmeterol (Serevent®) inhalers.</p><p>Talk to your doctor or get medical care right away if:</p><ul>
<li>Your or your child's symptoms do not improve after using mometasone and formoterol for 1 week or if they become worse.</li>
<li>Your short-acting inhaler does not seem to be working as well as usual and you need to use it more often (eg, you use 1 whole canister of your short-acting inhaler in 8 weeks time, or you need to use 4 or more inhalations of your short-acting inhaler for 2 or more days in a row).</li>
<li>You or your child have a significant decrease in your peak flow when measured as directed by your doctor.</li>
</ul><p>Your doctor may want you to carry a medical identification card stating that you or your child are using mometasone and formoterol and that you may need additional medicine during times of emergency, a severe asthma attack or other illness, or unusual stress.</p><p>You may get infections more easily while using mometasone and formoterol. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child have been exposed to someone with chickenpox or measles.</p><p>Mometasone and formoterol may cause fungus infection of the mouth or throat (thrush).

A low bone mineral density can cause weak bones or osteoporosis. If you have any questions about this, ask your doctor.</p><p>Mometasone and formoterol may cause children to grow more slowly than usual. Talk to your child's doctor if you have any concerns.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
