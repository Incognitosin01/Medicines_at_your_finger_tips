</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ciclomazole</h2><p class="First">Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream is a combination of an azole antifungal and corticosteroid and is indicated for the topical treatment of symptomatic inflammatory tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis due to <span class="Italics">Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes,</span> and <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum</span> in patients 17 years and older.</p><h2>Ciclomazole Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Treatment of tinea corporis or tinea cruris:</p><ul>
<li>Apply a thin film of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream into the affected skin areas twice a day for one week.</li>
<li>Do not use more than 45 grams per week. Do not use with occlusive dressings.</li>
<li>If a patient shows no clinical improvement after 1 week of treatment with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream, the diagnosis should be reviewed.</li>
<li>Do not use longer than 2 weeks.</li>
</ul><p>Treatment of tinea pedis:</p><ul>
<li>Gently massage a sufficient amount of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream into the affected skin areas twice a day for two weeks.</li>
<li>Do not use more than 45 grams per week. Do not use with occlusive dressings.</li>
<li>If a patient shows no clinical improvement after 2 week of treatment with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream, the diagnosis should be reviewed.</li>
<li>Do not use longer than 4 weeks.</li>
</ul><p>Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream is for topical use only. It is not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Cream, 1%/0.05% (base). Each gram of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream, USP contains 10 mg of clotrimazole, USP and 0.64 mg of betamethasone dipropionate USP, (equivalent to 0.5 mg of betamethasone) in a white to off-white hydrophilic cream.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Effects on Endocrine System</h3><p class="First">Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Cushingâ€™s syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effect of corticosteroids while on treatment. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressing, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.</p><p>Because of the potential for systemic corticosteroid effects, patients may need to be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test.</p><p>In a small trial, clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied using large dosages, 7 g daily for 14 days (twice a day) to the crural area of normal adult subjects. Three of the 8 normal subjects on whom clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was applied exhibited low morning plasma cortisol levels during treatment. One of these subjects had an abnormal cosyntropin test. The effect on morning plasma cortisol was transient and subjects recovered 1 week after discontinuing dosing. In addition, 2 separate trials in pediatric subjects demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p>If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid.</p><p>Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin-surface-to-body mass ratios <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h3>Diaper Dermatitis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">The use of</span> <span class="Bold">clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the treatment of diaper dermatitis is not recommended.</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>In clinical trials common adverse reaction reported for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream was paresthesia in 1.9% of patients. Adverse reactions reported at a frequency less than 1% included rash, edema, and secondary infection.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids: itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, skin atrophy, striae, miliaria, capillary fragility (ecchymoses), telangiectasia, and sensitization (local reactions upon repeated application of product).</p><p>Adverse reactions reported with the use of clotrimazole are: erythema, stinging, blistering, peeling, edema, pruritus, urticaria, and general irritation of the skin.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in pregnant women. Therefore, clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>There have been no teratogenic studies performed in animals or humans with the combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate. Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered at relatively low dosage levels.</p><p>Studies in pregnant rats with intravaginal doses up to 100 mg/kg (15 times the maximum human dose) revealed no evidence of fetotoxicity due to clotrimazole exposure.</p><p>No increase in fetal malformations was noted in pregnant rats receiving oral (gastric tube) clotrimazole doses up to 100 mg/kg/day during gestation Days 6 to 15. However, clotrimazole dosed at 100 mg/kg/day was embryotoxic (increased resorptions), fetotoxic (reduced fetal weights), and maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) to rats. Clotrimazole dosed at 200 mg/kg/day (30 times the maximum human dose) was maternally lethal, and therefore, fetuses were not evaluated in this group. Also in this study, doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human dose) had no adverse effects on dams or fetuses. However, in the combined fertility, teratogenicity, and postnatal development study described above, 50 mg/kg clotrimazole was associated with reduced maternal weight gain and reduced numbers of offspring reared to 4 weeks.</p><p>Oral clotrimazole doses of 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day (2 to 15 times the maximum human dose) were not teratogenic in mice. No evidence of maternal toxicity or embryotoxicity was seen in pregnant rabbits dosed orally with 60, 120, or 180 mg/kg/day (18 to 55 times the maximum human dose).</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits when given by the intramuscular route at doses of 0.05 mg/kg. This dose is approximately one-fifth the maximum human dose. The abnormalities observed included umbilical hernias, cephalocele, and cleft palates.</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate has not been tested for teratogenic potential by the dermal route of administration. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application to laboratory animals.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and can suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids can result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in patients under 17 years of age is not recommended.</p><p>Adverse events consistent with corticosteroid use have been observed in pediatric patients treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream. In open-label trials, 17 of 43 (39.5%) evaluable pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 16 years old) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for treatment of tinea pedis demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing. In another open-label trial, 8 of 17 (47.1%) evaluable pediatric subjects (aged 12 to 16 years old) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream for treatment of tinea cruris demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing.</p><p>Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are, therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to skin atrophy, including striae, when they are treated with topical corticosteroids.</p><p>HPA axis suppression, Cushingâ€™s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Avoid use of</span> <span class="Bold">clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in the treatment of diaper dermatitis.</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream under occlusion, such as in diaper dermatitis, is not recommended.</p><p>Postmarket adverse event reporting for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream in patients aged 65 and above includes reports of skin atrophy and rare reports of skin ulceration. Caution should be exercised with the use of these corticosteroid-containing topical products on thinning skin.</p><h2>Ciclomazole Description</h2><p class="First">Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream USP, 1%/0.05% (base), contains combinations of clotrimazole USP, an azole antifungal, and betamethasone dipropionate USP, a corticosteroid, for topical use.</p><p>Chemically, clotrimazole, USP is 1-( <span class="Italics">o</span>-Chloro-Î±,Î±-diphenylbenzyl)imidazole, with the molecular formula C <span class="Sub">22</span>H <span class="Sub">17</span>ClN <span class="Sub">2</span>, a molecular weight of 344.84, and the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>Clotrimazole, USP is an odorless, white crystalline powder, insoluble in water and soluble in ethanol.</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate, USP has 9-Fluoro-11Î²,17,21-trihydroxy-16Î²-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17,21-dipropionate, with the molecular formula C <span class="Sub">28</span>H <span class="Sub">37</span>FO <span class="Sub">7</span>, a molecular weight of 504.59, and the following structural formula:</p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate, USP is a white to creamy-white, odorless crystalline powder, insoluble in water.</p><p>Each gram of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream, USP contains 10 mg clotrimazole, USP and 0.64 mg betamethasone dipropionate, USP (equivalent to 0.5 mg betamethasone), in a white to off-white hydrophilic cream. Inactive ingredients: Ceteareth-30, cetyl alcohol, mineral oil, propylene glycol, purified water, sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, stearyl alcohol and white petrolatum; benzyl alcohol as preservative.</p><h2>Ciclomazole - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Clotrimazole is an azole antifungal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].</span></p><p>Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action for the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris and tinea corporis is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Vasoconstrictor Assay</span></p><p>Studies performed with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream indicate that these topical combination antifungal/corticosteroids may have vasoconstrictor potencies in a range that is comparable to high-potency topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate following topical application of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream has not been studied.</p><p>The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span> .</p><p>Once absorbed through the skin, the pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroids are similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Clotrimazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits 14-Î±-demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. This leads to the accumulation of 14-Î±-methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol, a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane. The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system, thereby inhibiting growth of fungi.</p><p><span class="Bold">Activity <span class="Italics">In Vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">In Vivo</span></span></p><p>Clotrimazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following dermatophytes, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections, <span class="Italics">Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes,</span> and <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum</span> <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Resistance</span></p><p>Strains of dermatophytes having a natural resistance to clotrimazole have not been reported. Resistance to azoles, including clotrimazole, has been reported in some <span class="Italics">Candida</span> species.</p><p>No single-step or multiple-step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of <span class="Italics">Trichophyton mentagrophytes.</span></p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">There are no adequate laboratory animal studies with either the combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate or with either component individually to evaluate carcinogenesis.</p><p>Betamethasone was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity assay ( <span class="Italics">Salmonella typhimurium</span> and <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>) and in the mammalian cell mutagenicity assay (CHO/HGPRT). It was positive in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay, and equivocal in the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p>Reproductive studies with betamethasone dipropionate carried out in rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg by the intramuscular route and in mice up to 33 mg/kg by the intramuscular route indicated no impairment of fertility except for dose-related increases in fetal resorption rates in both species. These doses are approximately 5- and 38-fold the maximum human dose based on body surface areas, respectively.</p><p>In a combined study of the effects of clotrimazole on fertility, teratogenicity, and postnatal development, male and female rats were dosed orally (diet admixture) with levels of 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 to 8 times the maximum dose in a 60-kg adult based on body surface area) from 10 weeks prior to mating until 4 weeks postpartum. No adverse effects on the duration of estrous cycle, fertility, or duration of pregnancy were noted.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In clinical trials of tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis, subjects treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream showed a better clinical response at the first return visit than subjects treated with clotrimazole cream. In tinea corporis and tinea cruris, the subject returned 3 to 5 days after starting treatment, and in tinea pedis, after 1 week. Mycological cure rates observed in subjects treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream were as good as, or better than, in those subjects treated with clotrimazole cream. In these same clinical studies, patients treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream showed better clinical responses and mycological cure rates when compared with subjects treated with betamethasone dipropionate cream.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream, USP is available as follows:</p><p>15 gram tube in a carton (NDC 0472-0379-15)</p><p>45 gram tube in a carton (NDC 0472-0379-45)</p><p>Store at 20Â° to 25Â°C (68Â° to 77Â°F); excursions permitted to 15Â° to 30Â°C (59Â° to 86Â°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling ( Patient Information)</p><p>Inform the patient of the following:</p><ul class="Disc">

In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. Ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20â€“65% involvement of the target great toenail plate. Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology), and in two studies for the endpoint "almost clear" (â‰¤10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of study. These results are presented below.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">At Week 48 (plus Last Observation Carried Forward) for the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 312</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 313</span></p><p class="First">Active</p><p class="First">Vehicle</p><p class="First">Active</p><p class="First">Vehicle</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Complete</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Cure*</span></p><p class="First">6/110</p><p>(5.5%)</p><p class="First">1/109</p><p>(0.9%)</p><p class="First">10/118</p><p>(8.5%)</p><p class="First">0/117</p><p>(0%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Almost</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Clear**</span></p><p class="First">7/107</p><p>(6.5%)</p><p class="First">1/108</p><p>(0.9%)</p><p class="First">14/116</p><p>(12%)</p><p class="First">1/115</p><p>(0.9%)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Negative Mycology Alone***</span></p><p class="First">30/105</p><p>(29%)</p><p class="First">12/106</p><p>(11%)</p><p class="First">41/115</p><p>(36%)</p><p class="First">10/114</p><p>(9%)</p><p class="First">* Clear nail and negative mycology</p><p>** â‰¤ 10% nail involvement and negative mycology</p><p>*** Negative KOH and negative culture</p><p>The summary of reported patient outcomes for the ITT population at 12 weeks following the end of treatment are presented below.

It is for use on nails and immediately adjacent skin only.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur with the use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. So far there is no relevant clinical experience with patients with insulin-dependent diabetes or who have diabetic neuropathy. The risk of removal of the unattached, infected nail, by the health care professional and trimming by the patient, should be carefully considered before prescribing to patients with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or diabetic neuropathy.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Patients should have detailed instructions regarding the use of Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis in order to achieve maximum benefit with the use of this product.</span></p><p>The patient should be told to:</p><p>1. Use Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% as directed by a health care professional. Avoid contact with the eyes and mucous membranes. Contact with skin other than skin immediately surrounding the treated nail(s) should be avoided. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% is for external use only.<br/>
2. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate and 5 mm of surrounding skin. If possible, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% should be applied to the nail bed, hyponychium, and the undersurface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed (e.g., onycholysis). Contact with the surrounding skin may produce mild, transient irritation (redness).<br/>
3. Removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, by a health care professional is needed with use of this medication. Inform a health care professional if they have diabetes or problems with numbness in the toes or fingers for consideration of the appropriate nail management program.<br/>
4. Inform a health care professional if the area of application shows signs of increased irritation (redness, itching, burning, blistering, swelling, or oozing).<br/>
5. Up to 48 weeks of daily applications with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% and professional removal of the unattached, infected nail, as frequently as monthly, are considered the full treatment needed to achieve a clear or almost clear nail (defined as 10% or less residual nail involvement).<br/>
6. Six months of therapy with professional removal of the unattached, infected nail may be required before initial improvement of symptoms is noticed.<br/>
7. A completely clear nail may not be achieved with use of this medication. In clinical studies less than 12% of patients were able to achieve either a completely clear or almost clear toenail.<br/>
8. Do not use the medication for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed.<br/>
9. Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on the treated nails.<br/>
10. Avoid use near heat or open flame, because product is flammable.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility -</h3><p class="First">No carcinogenicity study was conducted with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% formulation. A carcinogenicity study of ciclopirox (1% and 5% solutions in polyethylene glycol 400) in female mice dosed topically twice per week for 50 weeks followed by a six-month drug-free observation period prior to necropsy revealed no evidence of tumors at the application sites. In human systemic tolerability studies following daily application (~340 mg of ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) in subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis, the average maximal serum level of ciclopirox was 31Â±28 ng/mL after two months of once daily applications. This level was 159 times lower than the lowest toxic dose and 115 times lower than the highest nontoxic dose in rats and dogs fed 7.7 and 23.1 mg ciclopirox (as ciclopirox olamine)/kg/day.</p><p>The following in vitro genotoxicity tests have been conducted with ciclopirox: evaluation of gene mutation in Ames Salmonella and E. coli assays (negative); chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, with and without metabolic activation (positive); gene mutation assay in the HGPRT-test with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (negative); unscheduled DNA synthesis in human A549 cells (negative); and BALB/c3T3 cell transformation assay (negative). In an in vivo Chinese hamster bone marrow cytogenetic assay, ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at 5,000 mg/kg.</p><p>The following in vitro genotoxicity tests were conducted with ciclopirox topical solution, 8%: Ames Salmonella test (negative); unscheduled DNA synthesis in the rat hepatocytes (negative); cell transformation assay in BALB/c3T3 cell assay (positive). The positive response of the lacquer formulation in the BALB/c3T3 test was attributed to its butyl monoester of poly[methylvinyl ether/maleic acid] resin component (GantrezÂ® ES-435), which also tested positive in this test. The cell transformation assay may have been confounded because of the film-forming nature of the resin.</p><p>GantrezÂ® ES-435 tested nonmutagenic in both the in vitro mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay with or without activation and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rat hepatocytes.</p><p>Oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 3.85 mg ciclopirox (as ciclopirox olamine)/kg/day [equivalent to approximately 1.4 times the potential exposure at the maximum recommended human topical dose (MRHTD)] did not reveal any specific effects on fertility or other reproductive parameters. MRHTD (mg/m2) is based on the assumption of 100% systemic absorption of 27.12 mg ciclopirox (~340 mg ciclopirox topical solution, 8%) that will cover all the fingernails and toenails including 5 mm proximal and lateral fold area plus onycholysis to a maximal extent of 50%.</p><h3>Pregnancy:</h3><p class="First">Teratology studies in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys at oral doses of up to 77, 23, 23, or 38.5 mg, respectively, of ciclopirox as ciclopirox olamine/kg/day (14, 8, 17, and 28 times MRHTD), or in rats and rabbits receiving topical doses of up to 92.4 and 77 mg/kg/day, respectively (33 and 55 times MRHTD), did not indicate any significant fetal malformations.</p><p>There are no adequate or well-controlled studies of topically applied ciclopirox in pregnant women. Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers -</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use -</h3><p class="First">Based on the safety profile in adults, Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% is considered safe for use in children 12 years and older. No clinical trials have been conducted in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use -</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of ciclopirox topical solution, 8% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In the vehicle-controlled clinical trials conducted in the United States, 9% (30/327) of patients treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, and 7% (23/328) of patients treated with vehicle reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) considered by the investigator to be causally related to the test material.</p><p>The incidence of these adverse events, within each body system, was similar between the treatment groups except for skin and appendages: 8% (27/327) and 4% (14/328) of subjects in the ciclopirox and vehicle groups reported at least one adverse event, respectively. The most common were rash-related adverse events: periungual erythema and erythema of the proximal nail fold were reported more frequently in patients treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, (5% [16/327]) than in patients treated with vehicle (1% [3/328]). Other TEAEs thought to be causally related included nail disorders such as shape change, irritation, ingrown toenail, and discoloration.</p><p>The incidence of nail disorders was similar between the treatment groups (2% [6/327] in the ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, group and 2% [7/328] in the vehicle group). Moreover, application site reactions and/or burning of the skin occurred in 1% of patients treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, (3/327) and vehicle (4/328).</p><p>A 21-Day Cumulative Irritancy study was conducted under conditions of semi-occlusion. Mild reactions were seen in 46% of patients with the ciclopirox topical solution, 8%, 32% with the vehicle and 2% with the negative control, but all were reactions of mild transient erythema. There was no evidence of allergic contact sensitization for either the ciclopirox topical solution, 8% or the vehicle base. In a separate study of the photosensitization potential of ciclopirox topical solution, 8% in a maximized test design that included the occluded application of sodium lauryl sulfate, no photoallergic reactions were noted. In four subjects localized allergic contact reactions were observed. In the vehicle-controlled studies, one patient treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% discontinued treatment due to a rash, localized to the palm (causal relation to test material undetermined).</p><p>Use of ciclopirox topical solution, 8% for 48 additional weeks was evaluated in an open-label extension study conducted in patients previously treated in the vehicle-controlled studies. Three percent (9/281) of subjects treated with ciclopirox topical solution, 8% experienced at least one TEAE that the investigator thought was causally related to the test material. Mild rash in the form of periungual erythema (1% [2/281]) and nail disorders (1% [4/281]) were the most frequently reported. Four patients discontinued therapy because of TEAEs. Two of the four had events considered to be related to test material: one patient's great toenail "broke away" and another had an elevated creatine phosphokinase level on Day 1 (after 48 weeks of treatment with the vehicle in the previous vehicle-controlled study).</p><p><span class="Bold">To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</span></p><h2>Ciclomazole Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% should be used as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis.
