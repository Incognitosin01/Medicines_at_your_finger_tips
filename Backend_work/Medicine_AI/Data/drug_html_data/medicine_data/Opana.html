An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic.</p><p>Opana is used to treat moderate to severe pain.</p><p>The extended-release form of this medicine is for around-the-clock treatment of severe pain.

</ul><p>a head injury or seizures;</p><p>breathing problems, sleep apnea;</p><p>drug or alcohol addiction, or mental illness;</p><p>urination problems;</p><p>liver or kidney problems; or</p><p>problems with your gallbladder, pancreas, or thyroid.</p><p>Some medicines can interact with oxymorphone and cause a serious condition called &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;b&gt;serotonin syndrome.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Be sure your doctor knows if you also take stimulant medicine, herbal products, or medicine for depression, mental illness, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or prevention of nausea and vomiting. <b>Ask your doctor before making any changes in how or when you take your medications.</b></p><p>If you use oxymorphone while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on habit-forming medicine may need medical treatment for several weeks.</p><p>It is not known whether oxymorphone passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I use Opana?</h2><p>Take Opana exactly as prescribed. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Opana can slow or stop your breathing, especially when you start using this medicine or whenever your dose is changed. Never take Opana in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain.</p><p>Opana may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. <b>Take this medicine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. MISUSE OF NARCOTIC PAIN MEDICATION CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription. Selling or giving away Opana to any other person is against the law.</b></p><p>Always check your bottle to make sure you have received the correct pills (same brand and type) of medicine prescribed by your doctor. Ask the pharmacist if you have any questions about the medicine you receive at the pharmacy.</p><p>Stop taking all other around-the-clock narcotic pain medications when you start taking Opana.</p><p>Take Opana on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.</p><p>Do not crush, break, or open an extended-release tablet. Swallow the tablet whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose. <b>Never crush or break an Opana tablet to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein.</b> This can cause death.</p><p>Some forms of Opana are made with ingredients that are not absorbed in the body. Part of the tablet may appear in your stool. This is a normal side effect and will not make the medication less effective.</p><p>Do not stop using Opana suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when you stop using this medicine.</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture, heat, and light.</p><p>Keep track your medicine. Oxymorphone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p><p>Do not keep leftover Opana tablets. <b>Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.</b> Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush any unused tablets down the toilet. Disposal of medicines by flushing is recommended to reduce the danger of accidental overdose causing death. This advice applies to a very small number of medicines only. The FDA, working with the manufacturer, has determined this method to be the most appropriate route of disposal and presents the least risk to human safety.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since Opana is sometimes taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. If you are taking the medication regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. <b>A oxymorphone overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.</b></p><p>Overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, muscle weakness, confusion, cold and clammy skin, pinpoint pupils, slow heart rate, very slow breathing, or coma.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid?</h2><p><b>Do not drink alcohol.</b> Dangerous side effects or death could occur when alcohol is combined with oxymorphone.</p><p>This medication may impair your thinking or reactions. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Opana will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Opana side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction to Opana: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Like other narcotic medicines, oxymorphone can slow your breathing. Death may occur if breathing becomes too weak.</p><p>A person caring for you should seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
