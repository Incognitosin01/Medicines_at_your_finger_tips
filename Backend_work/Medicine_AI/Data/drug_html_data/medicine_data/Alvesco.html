It prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation.</p><p>Alvesco is used to prevent asthma attacks in adults and children who are at least 12 years.

Use only a fast acting inhalation medicine for an asthma attack. Tell your doctor if it seems like your asthma medications don't work as well.</p><p>Steroid medication can weaken your immune system, making it easier for you to get an infection. Steroids can also worsen an infection you already have, or reactivate an infection you recently had. Before taking Alvesco, tell your doctor about any illness or infection you have had within the past several weeks.</p><p>Before using Alvesco, tell your doctor if you have tuberculosis, an infection of your mouth or throat (such as oral thrush), glaucoma or history of cataracts, herpes infection of your eyes, or a personal or family history of osteoporosis.</p><p>If you also use a steroid medication, do not stop using the steroid suddenly or you may have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.

Call your doctor right away if you feel that Alvesco inhalation makes your condition worse.</p><p>Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections if possible.
