Attach filter before irrigating eye. Instill into anterior chamber before or after securing one or more sutures; instillation should be gentle and parallel to the iris face and tangential to the pupil border; in cataract surgery, acetylcholine should be used only after delivery of the lens.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store unopened vial at 4°C to 25°C (39°F to 77°F); prevent from freezing. Prepare solution immediately before use and discard unused portion. Acetylcholine solutions are unstable. Only use if solution is clear and colorless.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Cholinergic Agonists. Specifically, cholinergic effects may be enhanced or increased.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Beta-Blockers: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Cholinergic Agonists. Of particular concern are the potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities and bronchoconstriction.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sincalide: Drugs that Affect Gallbladder Function may diminish the therapeutic effect of Sincalide.  Management: Consider discontinuing drugs that may affect gallbladder motility prior to the use of sincalide to stimulate gallbladder contraction.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.

In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, ophthalmic cholinergic agents have been determined to be agents that may exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction (magnitude: minor) (AHA [Page 2016]).</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Aseptic conditions: Open under aseptic conditions only; do not gas sterilize.</p><p>• Cataract surgery: During cataract surgery, use only after lens is in place.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used during eye surgery.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
