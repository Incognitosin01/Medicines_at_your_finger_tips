Call your doctor right away if your child has any unusual changes in mood or behavior (anger, aggression, crying, feeling restless or irritable).</p><p>Nafarelin may also cause seizures, especially in people who have had a seizure, epilepsy, a brain tumor, or blood vessel problems in the brain. Your risk of a seizure may also be higher if you take certain antidepressant medications.</p><p>You should not use nafarelin nasal if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been checked by a doctor.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not use  nafarelin nasal if you are allergic to nafarelin or similar medicines such as goserelin, leuprolide, histrelin, or triptorelin.</p><p><b>If you are female,</b> you should not use nafarelin nasal if you have:</p><ul>

You may need to have a negative pregnancy test before starting this treatment.</p><p>Even though this medicine may cause you not to ovulate or have regular menstrual periods, <b>you should use effective nonhormonal birth control to prevent pregnancy</b> while you are using this medicine.</p><p>Nafarelin nasal can make hormonal birth control less effective, including birth control pills, injections, implants, skin patches, and vaginal rings. To prevent pregnancy while using nafarelin, use a barrier form of birth control: condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or contraceptive sponge.</p><p>You should not breastfeed while using nafarelin nasal.</p><h2>How should I use nafarelin nasal?</h2><p>Your doctor will perform tests to make sure this medicine is the right treatment for your child's condition.</p><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets.

This may cause your child's symptoms of precocious puberty to get worse for a short time. <b>Call your doctor if pubertal signs continue for longer than 1 month.</b></p><p>If you have regular menstrual periods, they should stop while you are using nafarelin nasal. Tell your doctor if your periods continue for longer than 1 month after you start using this medicine.</p><p>Do not use a nafarelin nasal spray bottle for longer than 30 days.

Do not freeze. Keep the bottle tightly capped when not in use.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Use the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose.
