It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone, and when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.</p><p>This medicine is also used to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and acne in women at least 14 years of age. PMDD is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Patients with PMDD may have severe emotional and physical symptoms 10 to 14 days before their menstrual flow starts.</p><p>No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than birth control pills. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.</p><p>This medicine does not prevent AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Yaz 28</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
