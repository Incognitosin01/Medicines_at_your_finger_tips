The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease.</p><p>The following information applies only to the Haemophilus b polysaccharide vaccine.</p><p>Infection by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria can cause life-threatening illnesses, such as meningitis, which affects the brain; epiglottitis, which can cause death by suffocation; pericarditis, which affects the heart; pneumonia, which affects the lungs; and septic arthritis, which affects the bones and joints. Hib meningitis causes death in 5 to 10% of children who are infected. Also, approximately 30% of children who survive Hib meningitis are left with some type of serious permanent damage, such as mental retardation, deafness, epilepsy, or partial blindness.</p><p>Immunization against Hib is recommended for all children 24 months up to 5 years of age (i.e., up to the 5th birthday). In addition, immunization is recommended for children 18 to 24 months of age, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Children attending day-care facilities.</li>
<li>Children with chronic illnesses associated with increased risk of Hib disease. These illnesses include asplenia, sickle cell disease, antibody deficiency syndromes, immunosuppression, and Hodgkin's disease.</li>
<li>Children 18 to 24 months of age who have already had Hib disease. These children may get the disease again if they are not immunized. Children who developed Hib disease when 24 months of age or older do not need to be immunized, since most children in this age group will develop antibodies against the disease.</li>
<li>Children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</li>
<li>Children of certain racial groups, such as American Indian and Alaskan Eskimo. Children in these groups seem to be at increased risk of Hib disease.</li>
<li>Children living close together with groups of other persons. Close living conditions increase a child's risk of being exposed to persons who have Hib infection or who carry the bacteria.</li>
</ul><p>It is recommended that children immunized when they were 18 to 24 months of age receive a second dose of vaccine, since these children may not produce enough antibodies to fully protect them from Hib disease. Children who were first immunized when they were 24 months of age or older do not need to be reimmunized.</p><p>This vaccine is available only from your doctor or other authorized health care professional.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using haemophilus b polysaccharide vaccine</h2><p>In deciding to use a vaccine, the risks of taking the vaccine must be weighed against the good it will do.
