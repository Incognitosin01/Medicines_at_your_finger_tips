</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Sodium Citrate Anticoagulant Solution</h2><p class="First">SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP is intended for use only for the anticoagulation of whole blood as part of automated apheresis procedures. <span class="Italics">[See Dosage and Administration (2).]</span></p><h2>Sodium Citrate Anticoagulant Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>General Dosing Information</h3><p class="First">SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP is added to tubing sets during apheresis procedures. The solution bag is connected to the tubing set in an apheresis collection. The recommended dose is determined by the apheresis device and metered into the tubing set by the apheresis device. It is not intended for direct intravenous infusion.</p><p>For instructions on the use of the solution with the apheresis device and tubing set, see the device operator's manual.</p><h3>Administration</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ensure solution is the SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP and is within the expiration date.</li>
<li>Inspect the bag. Do not use if the container is damaged, leaking or if there is any visible sign of deterioration.</li>
<li>Use only if solution is clear and free of particulate matter.</li>
<li>Protect from sharp objects.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Directions for connecting the</span> SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP <span class="Italics">bag to the apheresis device.</span></span></p><p>At the prompt to connect anticoagulant to the apheresis device tubing set:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Check for leaks by gently squeezing the bag. If leaks are found, discard the bag.</li>
<li>Ensure that the solution is the SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP and is within the expiration date.</li>
<li>Inspect the solution in good light. Bags showing cloudiness, haze, or particulate matter should not be used.</li>
</ul><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">250 mL SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP is a sterile solution in a polyolefin bag. Each 100 mL contains: Sodium Citrate (dihydrate) 4.0 g; Water for Injection to 100 mL, (pH adjusted with citric acid). Approximate millimoles of Sodium Citrate: 13.8.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">DO NOT INFUSE SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP DIRECTLY TO THE DONOR.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Verify that the SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP has been securely attached to the anticoagulant (AC) line on the system tubing set. Use aseptic technique throughout all procedures to ensure donor safety and quality.</li>
<li>Single-use container. Do not reuse. Discard any unused or partially used product.</li>
<li>Rx only.</li>
</ul><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Citrate reactions or toxicity may occur with the infusion of blood products to patients and return of blood containing citrate anticoagulant to donors. The recipient of the blood containing citrate should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity. The signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity begin with paresthesia, a "tingling" sensation around the mouth or in the extremities, followed by severe reactions that are characterized by hypotension and possible cardiac arrhythmia. Citrate toxicity may occur more frequently in patients who are hypothermic, have impaired liver or renal function, or have low calcium levels because of an underlying disease.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><p class="First">SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP has not been adequately studied in controlled clinical trials with specific populations.</p><h2>Sodium Citrate Anticoagulant Solution Description</h2><p class="First">SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP is designed to be metered by an apheresis device in apheresis procedures, to prevent platelet activation and coagulation as blood moves throughout the extracorporeal unit (tubing set) in an apheresis procedure.</p><p>The solution is sterile and non-pyrogenic, and it contains no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agents. Sterilized with steam.</p><p>The formulas of the active ingredients are provided in Table 1.</p><p>Each 100 mL of SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP contains: Sodium Citrate (dihydrate) 4.0 g; and Water for Injection to 100 mL (pH adjusted with citric acid). Approximate millimoles of sodium citrate: 13.8.</p><p>The polyolefin bag is not made with natural rubber latex.</p><p>The bag contains materials that have been tested to demonstrate the suitability of the container for storing pharmaceutical solutions. The bag is nontoxic and biologically inert. The bag-solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration. The bag is overwrapped to provide protection from the physical environment and to provide an additional moisture barrier when necessary.</p><h2>Sodium Citrate Anticoagulant Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP acts as an extracorporeal anticoagulant by binding the free calcium in the blood. Calcium is a necessary co-factor to several steps in the clotting cascade. The following ingredients are key components of the solution:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Citric acid for pH regulation</li>
<li>Sodium Citrate anticoagulant</li>
</ul><p>This solution has no pharmacological effect.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">SODIUM CITRATE 4% W/V ANTICOAGULANT SOLUTION USP is a clear solution supplied in sterile and non-pyrogenic polyolefin bags. The bags are packaged 30 bags per case.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">STORAGE</span></p><p>Up to 25 °C.</p><p>Protect from freezing.</p><p class="First">Issued: <span class="Bold">December 2019</span></p><p>Manufactured by<br/>
