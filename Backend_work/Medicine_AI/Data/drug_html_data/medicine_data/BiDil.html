It relaxes (widens) veins and arteries, which makes it easier for your heart to pump. Isosorbide dinitrate is in a group of drugs called nitrates. Isosorbide dinitrate dilates (widens) blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow through them and easier for the heart to pump.</p><p>BiDil is used to treat heart failure in certain patients.</p><p>BiDil may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use BiDil if you are taking medicine to treat erectile dysfunction or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).</b> This includes sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), avanafil (Stendra), tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca), vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn), and riociguat (Adempas).
