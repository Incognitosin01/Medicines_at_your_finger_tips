Influenza virus can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be passed through contact with objects the infected person has touched, such as a door handle or other surfaces.</p><p>Fluarix Quadrivalent is used to prevent infection caused by influenza virus. The vaccine is redeveloped each year to contain specific strains of inactivated (killed) flu virus that are recommended by public health officials for that year.</p><p>The injectable Fluarix Quadrivalent (flu shot) is a "killed virus" vaccine.</p><p>Fluarix Quadrivalent works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which helps your body to develop immunity to the disease. This medicine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Fluarix Quadrivalent is for use in adults and children who are at least 6 months old.</p><p>Becoming infected with influenza is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine. Influenza causes thousands of deaths each year, and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.</p><p>Like any vaccine, Fluarix Quadrivalent may not provide protection from disease in every person. This vaccine will not prevent illness caused by avian flu ("bird flu").</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>The injectable Fluarix Quadrivalent (flu shot) is a "killed virus" vaccine.</p><p>Becoming infected with influenza is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine.

You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or other clinic setting.</p><p>You should receive a flu vaccine every year. Your immunity will gradually decrease over the 12 months after you receive the Fluarix Quadrivalent. Children receiving this vaccine may need a booster shot one month after receiving the first vaccine.</p><p>The Fluarix Quadrivalent is usually given in October or November. Some people may need to have their vaccines earlier or later. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend treating fever and pain with an aspirin-free pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) when the shot is given and for the next 24 hours. Follow the label directions or your doctor's instructions about how much of this medicine to give your child.</p><p>It is especially important to prevent fever from occurring in a child who has a seizure disorder such as epilepsy.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since flu shots are usually given only one time per year, you will most likely not be on a dosing schedule.
