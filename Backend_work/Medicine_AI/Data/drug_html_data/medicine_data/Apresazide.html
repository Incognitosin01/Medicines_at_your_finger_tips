</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Diuretic</p><p>Chemical Class: Thiazide</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Apresazide</h2><p>Hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide combination is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).</p><p>High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure also may increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.</p><p>Hydralazine works by relaxing blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload. The hydrochlorothiazide is a type of medicine known as a thiazide diuretic and helps reduce the amount of water in the body by acting on the kidneys to increase the flow of urine.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Apresazide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
