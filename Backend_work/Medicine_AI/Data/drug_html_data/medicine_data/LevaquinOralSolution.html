The effectiveness of Levofloxacin is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Levofloxacin has not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of Levofloxacin in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged Levofloxacin therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1</span>, <span class="Italics">2.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.9)]</span>.</p><h3>Plague</h3><p class="First">Levofloxacin is indicated for treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to <span class="Italics">Yersinia pestis</span> (<span class="Italics">Y. pestis</span>) and prophylaxis for plague in adults and pediatric patients, 6 months of age and older. Efficacy studies of Levofloxacin could not be conducted in humans with plague for ethical and feasibility reasons.

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Culture and susceptibility testing</span></p><p>Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to levofloxacin <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>. Therapy with Levofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be selected.</p><p>As with other drugs in this class, some isolates of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with Levofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information about the continued susceptibility of the pathogens to the antimicrobial agent and also the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.</p><h2>Levaquin Oral Solution Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function</h3><p class="First">The usual dose of Levofloxacin Oral Solution is 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg administered orally every 24 hours, as indicated by infection and described in Table 1.</p><p>These recommendations apply to patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min. For patients with creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min, adjustments to the dosing regimen are required <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage in Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The dosage in pediatric patients ≥ 6 months of age is described below in Table 2.</p><h3>Dosage Adjustment in Adults with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Administer Levofloxacin with caution in the presence of renal insufficiency. Careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be performed prior to and during therapy since elimination of levofloxacin may be reduced.</p><p>No adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min.</p><p>In patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min), adjustment of the dosage regimen is necessary to avoid the accumulation of levofloxacin due to decreased clearance <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]</span>.</p><p>Table 3 shows how to adjust dose based on creatinine clearance.</p><h3>Drug Interaction With Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levofloxacin Oral Solution</span></p><p>Levofloxacin Oral Solution should be administered at least two hours before or two hours after antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine chewable/buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Food and Levofloxacin Oral Solution</span></p><p>It is recommended that Levofloxacin Oral Solution be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hydration for Patients Receiving Levofloxacin Oral Solution</span></p><p>Adequate hydration of patients receiving oral Levofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of highly concentrated urine. Crystalluria and cylindruria have been reported with quinolones <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)</span> and <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">ORAL SOLUTION, 25 mg/mL, clear yellow to clear greenish-yellow color</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Levofloxacin is contraindicated in persons with known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin, or other quinolone antibacterials <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting Levofloxacin. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="following_xmChange">Discontinue Levofloxacin immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones.</span></p><h3>Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting Levofloxacin or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.</p><p>The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in those taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have been reported in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue Levofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid Levofloxacin in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or tendon rupture <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)</span>; <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of Levofloxacin and may be irreversible in some patients <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]</span>.</p><p>Discontinue Levofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)</span>, <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Central Nervous System Effects</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) effects, including convulsions, toxic psychoses, increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri). Fluoroquinolones may also cause central nervous system stimulation which may lead to tremors, restlessness, anxiety, lightheadedness, confusion, <span class="following_xmChange">hallucinations, paranoia, depression, nightmares, insomnia, and, rarely, suicidal thoughts or acts, including completed suicide, especially in patients with a medical history of depression, or an underlying risk factor for depression.These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these</span> reactions occur in patients receiving Levofloxacin, discontinue Levofloxacin and institute appropriate measures. As with other fluoroquinolones, Levofloxacin should be used with caution in patients with a known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) disorder that may predispose them to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose them to seizures or lower the seizure threshold (e.g., certain drug therapy, renal dysfunction). <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)</span>; <span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7.4</span>, <span class="Italics">7.5)</span>; <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis</h3><p class="First">Fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid Levofloxacin in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)</span>; <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.3)].</span></p><h3>Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions</h3><p class="First">Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome);</li>
<li>vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness;</li>
<li>allergic pneumonitis;</li>
<li>interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure;</li>
<li>hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure;</li>
<li>anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities.</li>
</ul><p>Discontinue Levofloxacin immediately at the first appearance of skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and institute supportive measures <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6); Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin. These reactions often occur following the first dose. Some reactions have been accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, hypotension/shock, seizure, loss of consciousness, tingling, angioedema (including tongue, laryngeal, throat, or facial edema/swelling), airway obstruction (including bronchospasm, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress), dyspnea, urticaria, itching, and other serious skin reactions. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitative measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)</span>; <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity</h3><p class="First">Post-marketing reports of severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) have been received for patients treated with Levofloxacin. No evidence of serious drug-associated hepatotoxicity was detected in clinical trials of over 7,000 patients. Severe hepatotoxicity generally occurred within 14 days of initiation of therapy and most cases occurred within 6 days. Most cases of severe hepatotoxicity were not associated with hypersensitivity <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>. The majority of fatal hepatotoxicity reports occurred in patients 65 years of age or older and most were not associated with hypersensitivity. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately if the patient develops signs and symptoms of hepatitis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6); Patient Counseling Information (17.3)].</span></p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Levofloxacin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>, <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Prolongation of the QT Interval</h3><p class="First">Some fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Rare cases of torsade de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin. Levofloxacin should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, and patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)</span>, <span class="Italics">Use in Specific Populations (8.5),</span> and <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients and Arthropathic Effects in Animals</h3><p class="First">Levofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients (6 months of age and older) only for the prevention of inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) and for plague <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.7</span>, <span class="Italics">1.8)</span>]. An increased incidence of musculoskeletal disorders (arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, and gait abnormality) compared to controls has been observed in pediatric patients receiving Levofloxacin <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p>In immature rats and dogs, the oral and intravenous administration of levofloxacin resulted in increased osteochondrosis. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of immature dogs dosed with levofloxacin revealed persistent lesions of the cartilage. Other fluoroquinolones also produce similar erosions in the weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species <span class="Italics">[see Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Blood Glucose Disturbances</h3><p class="First">As with other fluoroquinolones, disturbances of blood glucose, including symptomatic hyper- and hypoglycemia, have been reported with Levofloxacin, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended.

</ul><p>Crystalluria and cylindruria have been reported with quinolones, including Levofloxacin. Therefore, adequate hydration of patients receiving Levofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</span>.</p><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The data described below reflect exposure to Levofloxacin in 7537 patients in 29 pooled Phase 3 clinical trials. The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 74% of the population was &lt; 65 years of age), 50% were male, 71% were Caucasian, 19% were Black. Patients were treated with Levofloxacin for a wide variety of infectious diseases <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1)]</span>. Patients received Levofloxacin doses of 750 mg once daily, 250 mg once daily, or 500 mg once or twice daily. Treatment duration was usually 3–14 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 10 days.</p><p>The overall incidence, type and distribution of adverse reactions was similar in patients receiving Levofloxacin doses of 750 mg once daily, 250 mg once daily, and 500 mg once or twice daily. Discontinuation of Levofloxacin due to adverse drug reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients overall, 3.8% of patients treated with the 250 mg and 500 mg doses and 5.4% of patients treated with the 750 mg dose. The most common adverse drug reactions leading to discontinuation with the 250 and 500 mg doses were gastrointestinal (1.4%), primarily nausea (0.6%); vomiting (0.4%); dizziness (0.3%); and headache (0.2%). The most common adverse drug reactions leading to discontinuation with the 750 mg dose were gastrointestinal (1.2%), primarily nausea (0.6%), vomiting (0.5%); dizziness (0.3%); and headache (0.3%).</p><p>Adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of Levofloxacin-treated patients and less common adverse reactions, occurring in 0.1 to &lt;1% of Levofloxacin-treated patients, are shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. The most common adverse drug reactions (≥3%) are nausea, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness.</p><p>In clinical trials using multiple-dose therapy, ophthalmologic abnormalities, including cataracts and multiple punctate lenticular opacities, have been noted in patients undergoing treatment with quinolones, including Levofloxacin. The relationship of the drugs to these events is not presently established.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Table 6 lists adverse reactions that have been identified during post-approval use of Levofloxacin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Chelation Agents: Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levofloxacin Oral Solution</span></p><p>While the chelation by divalent cations is less marked than with other fluoroquinolones, concurrent administration of Levofloxacin Oral Solution with antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc may interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. Tablets with antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine may substantially interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. These agents should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral Levofloxacin administration.</p><h3>Warfarin</h3><p class="First">No significant effect of Levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S- warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the postmarketing experience in patients that Levofloxacin enhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and Levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if Levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)</span>; <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Antidiabetic Agents</h3><p class="First">Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)</span>; <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>, <span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h3><p class="First">The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone, including Levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Theophylline</h3><p class="First">No significant effect of Levofloxacin on the plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for theophylline was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of theophylline on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, concomitant administration of other fluoroquinolones with theophylline has resulted in prolonged elimination half-life, elevated serum theophylline levels, and a subsequent increase in the risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions in the patient population. Therefore, theophylline levels should be closely monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made when Levofloxacin is co-administered. Adverse reactions, including seizures, may occur with or without an elevation in serum theophylline levels <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Cyclosporine</h3><p class="First">No significant effect of Levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for cyclosporine was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. However, elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported in the patient population when co-administered with some other fluoroquinolones. Levofloxacin C<span class="Sub">max</span> and k<span class="Sub">e</span> were slightly lower while T<span class="Sub">max</span> and t<span class="Sub">½</span> were slightly longer in the presence of cyclosporine than those observed in other studies without concomitant medication. The differences, however, are not considered to be clinically significant. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is required for Levofloxacin or cyclosporine when administered concomitantly.</p><h3>Digoxin</h3><p class="First">No significant effect of Levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for digoxin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Levofloxacin absorption and disposition kinetics were similar in the presence or absence of digoxin. Therefore, no dosage adjustment for Levofloxacin or digoxin is required when administered concomitantly.</p><h3>Probenecid and Cimetidine</h3><p class="First">No significant effect of probenecid or cimetidine on the C<span class="Sub">max</span> of levofloxacin was observed in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. The AUC and t<span class="Sub">½</span> of levofloxacin were higher while CL/F and CL<span class="Sub">R</span> were lower during concomitant treatment of Levofloxacin with probenecid or cimetidine compared to Levofloxacin alone. However, these changes do not warrant dosage adjustment for Levofloxacin when probenecid or cimetidine is co-administered.</p><h3>Interactions with Laboratory or Diagnostic Testing</h3><p class="First">Some fluoroquinolones, including Levofloxacin, may produce false-positive urine screening results for opiates using commercially available immunoassay kits. Confirmation of positive opiate screens by more specific methods may be necessary.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category C. Levofloxacin was not teratogenic in rats at oral doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day which corresponds to 9.4 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area, or at intravenous doses as high as 160 mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.9 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area. The oral dose of 810 mg/kg/day to rats caused decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality. No teratogenicity was observed when rabbits were dosed orally as high as 50 mg/kg/day which corresponds to 1.1 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area, or when dosed intravenously as high as 25 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.5 times the highest recommended human dose based upon relative body surface area.</p><p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Levofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Based on data on other fluoroquinolones and very limited data on Levofloxacin, it can be presumed that levofloxacin will be excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Levofloxacin in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Quinolones, including levofloxacin, cause arthropathy and osteochondrosis in juvenile animals of several species. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</span> and <span class="Italics">Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure)</span></p><p>Levofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older, for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure). The risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of levofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate.

Efficacy studies of Levofloxacin could not be conducted in humans with pneumonic plague for ethical and feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval of this indication was based on an efficacy study conducted in animals. The risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of levofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage (1.8)</span>, <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14.10)].</span></p><p>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of six months have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Events</span></p><p>In clinical trials, 1534 children (6 months to 16 years of age) were treated with oral and intravenous Levofloxacin. Children 6 months to 5 years of age received Levofloxacin 10 mg/kg twice a day and children greater than 5 years of age received 10 mg/kg once a day (maximum 500 mg per day) for approximately 10 days.</p><p>A subset of children in the clinical trials (1340 Levofloxacin-treated and 893 non-fluoroquinolone-treated) enrolled in a prospective, long-term surveillance study to assess the incidence of protocol-defined musculoskeletal disorders (arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, gait abnormality) during 60 days and 1 year following the first dose of the study drug. Children treated with Levofloxacin had a significantly higher incidence of musculoskeletal disorders when compared to the non-fluoroquinolone-treated children as illustrated in Table 7.</p><p>Arthralgia was the most frequently occurring musculoskeletal disorder in both treatment groups. Most of the musculoskeletal disorders in both groups involved multiple weight-bearing joints. Disorders were moderate in 8/46 (17%) children and mild in 35/46 (76%) Levofloxacin-treated children and most were treated with analgesics. The median time to resolution was 7 days for Levofloxacin-treated children and 9 for non-fluoroquinolone-treated children (approximately 80% resolved within 2 months in both groups). No child had a severe or serious disorder and all musculoskeletal disorders resolved without sequelae.</p><p>Vomiting and diarrhea were the most frequently reported adverse events, occurring in similar frequency in the Levofloxacin-treated and non-fluoroquinolone-treated children.</p><p>In addition to the events reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, events reported in adults during clinical trials or post-marketing experience <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</span> may also be expected to occur in pediatric patients.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as Levofloxacin. This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing Levofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue Levofloxacin and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning</span>; <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</span>; and <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6.3)]</span>.</p><p>In Phase 3 clinical trials, 1,945 Levofloxacin-treated patients (26%) were ≥ 65 years of age. Of these, 1,081 patients (14%) were between the ages of 65 and 74 and 864 patients (12%) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Severe, and sometimes fatal, cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported post-marketing in association with Levofloxacin. The majority of fatal hepatotoxicity reports occurred in patients 65 years of age or older and most were not associated with hypersensitivity. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately if the patient develops signs and symptoms of hepatitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]</span>.</p><p>Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using Levofloxacin with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g., Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]</span>.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic properties of levofloxacin in younger adults and elderly adults do not differ significantly when creatinine clearance is taken into consideration. However, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Clearance of levofloxacin is substantially reduced and plasma elimination half-life is substantially prolonged in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min), requiring dosage adjustment in such patients to avoid accumulation. Neither hemodialysis nor continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is effective in removal of levofloxacin from the body, indicating that supplemental doses of Levofloxacin are not required following hemodialysis or CAPD <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Pharmacokinetic studies in hepatically impaired patients have not been conducted. Due to the limited extent of levofloxacin metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin are not expected to be affected by hepatic impairment.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of an acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied. The patient should be observed and appropriate hydration maintained. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.</p><p>Levofloxacin exhibits a low potential for acute toxicity. Mice, rats, dogs and monkeys exhibited the following clinical signs after receiving a single high dose of Levofloxacin: ataxia, ptosis, decreased locomotor activity, dyspnea, prostration, tremors, and convulsions. Doses in excess of 1500 mg/kg orally and 250 mg/kg IV produced significant mortality in rodents.</p><h2>Levaquin Oral Solution Description</h2><p class="First">Levofloxacin is a synthetic broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for oral administration. Chemically, levofloxacin, a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone, is the pure (-)-(S)-enantiomer of the racemic drug substance ofloxacin. The chemical name is (-)-(S)-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid hemihydrate.</p><p>The empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">18</span>H<span class="Sub">20</span>FN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">4</span> ∙ ½ H<span class="Sub">2</span>O and the molecular weight is 370.38. Levofloxacin is a light yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder. The molecule exists as a zwitterion at the pH conditions in the small intestine.</p><p>The data demonstrate that from pH 0.6 to 5.8, the solubility of levofloxacin is essentially constant (approximately 100 mg/mL). Levofloxacin is considered <span class="Italics">soluble to freely soluble</span> in this pH range, as defined by USP nomenclature. Above pH 5.8, the solubility increases rapidly to its maximum at pH 6.7 (272 mg/mL) and is considered <span class="Italics">freely soluble</span> in this range. Above pH 6.7, the solubility decreases and reaches a minimum value (about 50 mg/mL) at a pH of approximately 6.9.</p><p>Levofloxacin has the potential to form stable coordination compounds with many metal ions. This <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chelation potential has the following formation order: Al<span class="Sup">+3</span>&gt;Cu<span class="Sup">+2</span>&gt;Zn<span class="Sup">+2</span>&gt;Mg<span class="Sup">+2</span>&gt;Ca<span class="Sup">+2</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excipients and Description of Dosage Forms</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Levofloxacin Oral Solution</span></p><p>Levofloxacin Oral Solution, 25 mg/mL, is a multi-use self-preserving aqueous solution of levofloxacin with pH ranging from 5.0 to 6.0. The appearance of Levofloxacin Oral Solution may range from clear yellow to clear greenish-yellow. This does not adversely affect product potency.</p><p>Levofloxacin Oral Solution contains the following inactive ingredients: artificial and natural flavors, ascorbic acid, benzyl alcohol, caramel color, glycerin, hydrochloric acid, propylene glycol, purified water, sucralose and sucrose. It may also contain a solution of sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment.</p><h2>Levaquin Oral Solution - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Levofloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents <span class="Italics">[see Microbiology (12.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The mean ± SD pharmacokinetic parameters of levofloxacin determined under single and steady-state conditions following oral tablet, oral solution, or intravenous (IV) doses of Levofloxacin are summarized in Table 8.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are usually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The absolute bioavailability of levofloxacin from a 500 mg tablet and a 750 mg tablet of Levofloxacin are both approximately 99%, demonstrating complete oral absorption of levofloxacin. Following a single intravenous dose of Levofloxacin to healthy volunteers, the mean ± SD peak plasma concentration attained was 6.2 ± 1.0 mcg/mL after a 500 mg dose infused over 60 minutes and 11.5 ± 4.0 mcg/mL after a 750 mg dose infused over 90 minutes. Levofloxacin Oral Solution and Tablet formulations are bioequivalent.</p><p>Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics are linear and predictable after single and multiple oral or IV dosing regimens. Steady-state conditions are reached within 48 hours following a 500 mg or 750 mg once-daily dosage regimen. The mean ± SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily oral dosage regimens were approximately 5.7 ± 1.4 and 0.5 ± 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 8.6 ± 1.9 and 1.1 ± 0.4 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. The mean ± SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained following multiple once-daily IV regimens were approximately 6.4 ± 0.8 and 0.6 ± 0.2 mcg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 12.1 ± 4.1 and 1.3 ± 0.71 mcg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. Oral administration of a 500 mg dose of Levofloxacin with food prolongs the time to peak concentration by approximately 1 hour and decreases the peak concentration by approximately 14% following tablet and approximately 25% following oral solution administration. Therefore, Levofloxacin Tablets can be administered without regard to food. It is recommended that Levofloxacin Oral Solution be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating.</p><p>The plasma concentration profile of levofloxacin after IV administration is similar and comparable in extent of exposure (AUC) to that observed for Levofloxacin Tablets when equal doses (mg/mg) are administered. Therefore, the oral and IV routes of administration can be considered interchangeable <span class="Italics">(see Figure 2 and Figure 3)</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean volume of distribution of levofloxacin generally ranges from 74 to 112 L after single and multiple 500 mg or 750 mg doses, indicating widespread distribution into body tissues. Levofloxacin reaches its peak levels in skin tissues and in blister fluid of healthy subjects at approximately 3 hours after dosing. The skin tissue biopsy to plasma AUC ratio is approximately 2 and the blister fluid to plasma AUC ratio is approximately 1 following multiple once-daily oral administration of 750 mg and 500 mg doses of Levofloxacin, respectively, to healthy subjects. Levofloxacin also penetrates well into lung tissues. Lung tissue concentrations were generally 2- to 5-fold higher than plasma concentrations and ranged from approximately 2.4 to 11.3 mcg/g over a 24-hour period after a single 500 mg oral dose.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, over a clinically relevant range (1 to 10 mcg/mL) of serum/plasma levofloxacin concentrations, levofloxacin is approximately 24 to 38% bound to serum proteins across all species studied, as determined by the equilibrium dialysis method. Levofloxacin is mainly bound to serum albumin in humans. Levofloxacin binding to serum proteins is independent of the drug concentration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p>Levofloxacin is stereochemically stable in plasma and urine and does not invert metabolically to its enantiomer, D-ofloxacin. Levofloxacin undergoes limited metabolism in humans and is primarily excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. Following oral administration, approximately 87% of an administered dose was recovered as unchanged drug in urine within 48 hours, whereas less than 4% of the dose was recovered in feces in 72 hours. Less than 5% of an administered dose was recovered in the urine as the desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites, the only metabolites identified in humans. These metabolites have little relevant pharmacological activity.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></p><p>Levofloxacin is excreted largely as unchanged drug in the urine. The mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin ranges from approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin given orally or intravenously. The mean apparent total body clearance and renal clearance range from approximately 144 to 226 mL/min and 96 to 142 mL/min, respectively. Renal clearance in excess of the glomerular filtration rate suggests that tubular secretion of levofloxacin occurs in addition to its glomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of either cimetidine or probenecid results in approximately 24% and 35% reduction in the levofloxacin renal clearance, respectively, indicating that secretion of levofloxacin occurs in the renal proximal tubule. No levofloxacin crystals were found in any of the urine samples freshly collected from subjects receiving Levofloxacin.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric</span></p><p>There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between young and elderly subjects when the subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration.</p><p>Following a 500 mg oral dose of Levofloxacin to healthy elderly subjects (66–80 years of age), the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.6 hours, as compared to approximately 6 hours in younger adults. The difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by age. Levofloxacin dose adjustment based on age alone is not necessary <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatrics</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin following a single 7 mg/kg intravenous dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from 6 months to 16 years. Pediatric patients cleared levofloxacin faster than adult patients, resulting in lower plasma exposures than adults for a given mg/kg dose. Subsequent pharmacokinetic analyses predicted that a dosage regimen of 8 mg/kg every 12 hours (not to exceed 250 mg per dose) for pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years of age would achieve comparable steady state plasma exposures (AUC<span class="Sub">0–24</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span>) to those observed in adult patients administered 500 mg of levofloxacin once every 24 hours.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gender</span></p><p>There are no significant differences in levofloxacin pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects when subjects' differences in creatinine clearance are taken into consideration. Following a 500 mg oral dose of Levofloxacin to healthy male subjects, the mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin was about 7.5 hours, as compared to approximately 6.1 hours in female subjects. This difference was attributable to the variation in renal function status of the male and female subjects and was not believed to be clinically significant. Drug absorption appears to be unaffected by the gender of the subjects. Dose adjustment based on gender alone is not necessary.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Race</span></p><p>The effect of race on levofloxacin pharmacokinetics was examined through a covariate analysis performed on data from 72 subjects: 48 white and 24 non-white.

In immature dogs (4–5 months old), oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days and intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg/day for 14 days of levofloxacin resulted in arthropathic lesions. Administration at oral doses of 300 mg/kg/day for 7 days and intravenous doses of 60 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks produced arthropathy in juvenile rats. Three-month old beagle dogs dosed orally with levofloxacin at 40 mg/kg/day exhibited clinically severe arthrotoxicity resulting in the termination of dosing at Day 8 of a 14-day dosing routine. Slight musculoskeletal clinical effects, in the absence of gross pathological or histopathological effects, resulted from the lowest dose level of 2.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2-fold the pediatric dose based upon AUC comparisons). Synovitis and articular cartilage lesions were observed at the 10 and 40 mg/kg dose levels (approximately 0.7-fold and 2.4-fold the pediatric dose, respectively, based on AUC comparisons).

<li><span class="Bold">Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions That May Occur Together</span>: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of Levofloxacin and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking Levofloxacin immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture:</span> Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue Levofloxacin treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Peripheral Neuropathies:</span> Inform patients that peripheral neuropathies have been associated with levofloxacin use, symptoms may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible. If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness and/or weakness develop, immediately discontinue Levofloxacin and tell them to contact their physician.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System Effects</span> (for example, convulsions, dizziness, lightheadedness, increased intracranial pressure)<span class="Bold">:</span> Inform patients that convulsions have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. Instruct patients to notify their physician before taking this drug if they have a history of convulsions. Inform patients that they should know how they react to Levofloxacin before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. Instruct patients to notify their physician if persistent headache with or without blurred vision occurs.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis:</span> Instruct patients to inform their physician of any history of myasthenia gravis. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, including respiratory difficulties.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Hypersensitivity Reactions:</span> Inform patients that levofloxacin can cause hypersensitivity reactions, even following a single dose, and to discontinue the drug at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Hepatotoxicity:</span> Inform patients that severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) has been reported in patients taking Levofloxacin. Instruct patients to inform their physician if they experience any signs or symptoms of liver injury including: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness, tiredness, right upper quadrant tenderness, itching, yellowing of the skin and eyes, light colored bowel movements or dark colored urine.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Diarrhea:</span> Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Prolongation of the QT Interval:</span> Instruct patients to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia; if they are taking any Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness.</li>
<li><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal Disorders in Pediatric Patients:</span> Instruct parents to inform their child's physician if the child has a history of joint-related problems before taking this drug. Inform parents of pediatric patients to notify their child's physician of any joint-related problems that occur during or following levofloxacin therapy <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></li>
<li><span class="Bold">Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity:</span> Inform patients that photosensitivity/phototoxicity has been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Inform patients to minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while taking fluoroquinolones. If patients need to be outdoors while using fluoroquinolones, instruct them to wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. If a sunburn-like reaction or skin eruption occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician.</li>
</ul><h3>Antibacterial Resistance</h3><p class="First">Antibacterial drugs including Levofloxacin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Levofloxacin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Levofloxacin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><h3>Administration with Food, Fluids, and Concomitant Medications</h3><p class="First">Levofloxacin Oral Solution should be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. The oral solution should be taken at the same time each day.</p><p>Patients should drink fluids liberally while taking Levofloxacin to avoid formation of a highly concentrated urine and crystal formation in the urine.</p><p>Antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral Levofloxacin administration.</p><h3>Drug Interactions with Insulin, Oral Hypoglycemic Agents, and Warfarin</h3><p class="First">Patients should be informed that if they are diabetic and are being treated with insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent and a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, they should discontinue Levofloxacin and consult a physician.</p><p>Patients should be informed that concurrent administration of warfarin and Levofloxacin has been associated with increases of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time and clinical episodes of bleeding. Patients should notify their physician if they are taking warfarin, be monitored for evidence of bleeding, and also have their anticoagulation tests closely monitored while taking warfarin concomitantly.</p><h3>Plague and Anthrax Studies</h3><p class="First">Patients given Levofloxacin for these conditions should be informed that efficacy studies could not be conducted in humans for ethical and feasibility reasons. Therefore, approval for these conditions was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals.</p><p>Active Ingredient Made in Japan</p><p>Finished Product Manufactured by:</p><p>Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., Beerse, Belgium.</p><p>Manufactured for:</p><p>Patriot Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Horsham, PA 19044.</p><p>© Patriot Pharmaceuticals, LLC</p><p>Issued August 2016</p><h3>FDA-Approved Medication Guide</h3><p class="First"> </p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">MEDICATION GUIDE<br/>

This Medication Guide does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment.</p><p><span class="Bold">What is the most important information I should know about Levofloxacin? Levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, can cause serious side effects. Some of these serious side effects can happen at the same time and could result in death.</span></p><p>If you have any of the following serious side effects while you take Levofloxacin, you should stop taking Levofloxacin immediately and get medical help right away.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li><span class="Bold">Tendon problems can happen in people of all ages who take Levofloxacin.</span> Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones.<br/>
Some tendon problems include pain, swelling, tears, and swelling of tendons including the back of the ankle (Achilles), shoulder, hand, or other tendon sites.</li>
<li>The risk of getting tendon problems while you take Levofloxacin is higher if you:
<ul class="Circle">
<li>are over 60 years of age</li>
<li>are taking steroids (corticosteroids)</li>
<li>have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant.</li>
</ul>
Tendon problems can happen in people who do not have the above risk factors when they take Levofloxacin.<br/>
Other reasons that can increase your risk of tendon problems can include:
<ul class="Circle">
<li>physical activity or exercise</li>
<li>kidney failure</li>
<li>tendon problems in the past, such as in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</li>
</ul>
Stop taking Levofloxacin immediately and get medical help right away at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling or inflammation. Avoid exercise and using the affected area.<br/>
The most common area of pain and swelling is the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. This can also happen with other tendons. You may need a different antibiotic that is not a fluoroquinolone to treat your infection.<br/>
Tendon rupture can happen while you are taking or after you have finished taking Levofloxacin. Tendon ruptures can happen within hours or days of taking Levofloxacin and have happened up to several months after people have finished taking their fluoroquinolone.<br/>
Stop taking Levofloxacin immediately and get medical help right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of a tendon rupture:
<ul class="Circle">
