</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Endocrine-Metabolic Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone Agonist</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for leuprolide</h2><p>Leuprolide injection is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is similar to a natural hormone that is produced in the brain. It is used to treat a number of medical problems including:</p><ul>
<li>Anemia caused by bleeding from uterine leiomyomas (fibroid tumors in the uterus), or</li>
<li>Cancer of the prostate that is advanced or late-stage, or</li>
<li>Central precocious puberty, a condition which causes early puberty in boys (before 9 years of age) and girls (before 8 years of age), or</li>
<li>Pain due to endometriosis.</li>
</ul><p><i>Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg</i> is used in combination with norethindrone acetate to initially relieve and manage the reoccurrence of the painful symptoms of endometriosis. It is also used together with iron to treat bleeding in women with anemia caused by uterine leiomyomas before a surgical procedure. It is given in women who need 3 months of hormonal suppression.</p><p>When given regularly to men, leuprolide decreases testosterone levels. Reducing the amount of testosterone in the body helps treat cancer of the prostate.</p><p>When given regularly to women, leuprolide decreases estrogen levels. Reducing the amount of estrogen in the body helps treat endometriosis. Leuprolide will also shrink tumors in the uterus, which decreases vaginal bleeding and helps prevent anemia.</p><p>When given regularly to boys and girls who have early puberty, leuprolide slows the development of the genital area for both sexes. Leuprolide will also slow breast development in girls. Leuprolide will delay puberty only as long as the child continues to receive it.</p><p>Leuprolide is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using leuprolide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For leuprolide, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to leuprolide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>leuprolide pediatric injection</i> in children. However, use is not recommended in children younger than 2 years of age. <i>Leuprolide pediatric injection</i> will stop having an effect for central precocious puberty soon after the child stops using it, and puberty will advance normally.</p><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Eligard®, Lupron®, Lupron Depot®, Lupron Depot®-3 month, Lupron Depot®-4 month, Lupron Depot®-6 month, Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg, or Viadur®</i> in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of <i>Eligard®, Lupron®, Lupron Depot®, Lupron Depot®-3 month, Lupron Depot®-4 month, or Lupron Depot®-6 month</i> in the elderly.</p><p>Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg</i> have not been performed in the geriatric population. Leuprolide is not indicated for use in elderly women.</p><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Fensolvi®, Lupron Depot-Ped® or Viadur®</i> in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using leuprolide.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using leuprolide with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

<li>A nurse or other trained health professional may give you leuprolide. It is given as a shot under your skin or into a muscle.</li>
<li>The long-acting form (depot) may be given once every month or once every 3 to 12 months. To stay on the right schedule, make sure you keep all appointments.</li>
<li>You may be taught how to give leuprolide at home. Make sure you understand all of the instructions before giving yourself an injection. Do not use more medicine or use it more often than your doctor tells you to.</li>
<li>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas.</li>
<li>Use a new needle and syringe each time you inject your medicine.</li>
<li>Check the medicine before each injection. Do not use it if it is discolored, if there are particles in it, or if there is clumping or caking of the powder present.</li>

<li>Viadur® is an implant that is surgically placed under the skin of the upper arm. Your doctor will treat the arm with numbing medicine and then cut a small incision to insert the implant with a special tool. The incision will be closed with surgical strips. An adhesive bandage will be placed over the arm and should be left on for 24 hours.</li>
<li>After the implant is put in place, you should keep the arm clean and dry, and should not swim or bathe for 24 hours. You should avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for 48 hours after the implant is put into the arm.</li>
