The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving trastuzumab/hyaluronidase with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. Evaluate left ventricular function in all patients prior to and during treatment with trastuzumab/hyaluronidase. Discontinue trastuzumab/hyaluronidase treatment in patients receiving adjuvant therapy and withhold trastuzumab/hyaluronidase in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function. </b>Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death. Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may also result in an asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Other cardiac adverse effects associated with trastuzumab/hyaluronidase include tachycardia, palpitations, and heart failure. Among patients receiving trastuzumab (as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy), there is a 4- to 6-fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction, compared to patients not receiving trastuzumab. The highest absolute incidence occurs when trastuzumab is administered with an anthracycline. The incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction for trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and IV trastuzumab was similar in clinical trials. Withhold trastuzumab/hyaluronidase for ≥16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and ≥10% absolute decrease in LVEF (from pretreatment values). The safety of continuing or resuming trastuzumab/hyaluronidase with trastuzumab-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and LVEF assessment (by echocardiogram or MUGA scan). LVEF should be assessed at baseline (immediately prior to trastuzumab/hyaluronidase initiation), every 3 months during and upon completion of trastuzumab/hyaluronidase therapy, every 4 weeks if trastuzumab/hyaluronidase is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, and every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of trastuzumab/hyaluronidase treatment when used as a component of adjuvant therapy.</p><p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has developed guidelines for prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in adult survivors of cancer (ASCO [Armenian 2017]). According to the guidelines, the risk of cardiac dysfunction related to trastuzumab is increased with the following:</p><p>- Trastuzumab alone AND any of the following risk factors: Multiple cardiovascular risk factors (≥2 risk factors), including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity (during or after completion of therapy), or older age (≥60 years of age) at cancer treatment, or compromised cardiac function (eg, borderline low LVEF [50% to 55%], history of myocardial infarction, moderate or higher valvular heart disease) before or during treatment.</p><p>- Treatment with lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin &lt;250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, epirubicin &lt;600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) followed by trastuzumab (sequential therapy)</p><p>The ASCO guidelines recommend a comprehensive assessment in patients with cancer that includes a history and physical examination, screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. An echocardiogram should be obtained prior to initiating potentially cardiotoxic therapies. Modifiable risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity) should be actively managed before initiating potentially cardiotoxic therapies. In patients who develop signs/symptoms of cardiac dysfunction during therapy, in addition to the above LVEF monitoring recommendations, an echocardiogram is recommended for diagnostic workup; if echocardiogram is not available or feasible, a cardiac MRI (preferred) or MUGA scan may be utilized. Serum cardiac biomarkers are recommended, along with referral to a cardiologist if indicated. Routine echocardiographic surveillance may be utilized in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving trastuzumab indefinitely.</p><p>• Hepatitis B virus reactivation: The ASCO hepatitis B screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with trastuzumab/hyaluronidase. Patients with dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and/or comorbidities may be at increased risk of a severe or fatal adverse reaction. Grades 3 or 4 reactions have occurred (rare); permanent discontinuation due to hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis was required in a small number of patients. Serious and fatal reactions have been reported following treatment with IV trastuzumab products. Monitor for systemic hypersensitivity reactions, particularly with the initial dose. Permanently discontinue trastuzumab/hyaluronidase in patients who experience anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions. Medications to treat anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity and emergency equipment should be available for immediate use. Consider premedication with an analgesic, antipyretic, or an antihistamine prior to subsequent trastuzumab/hyaluronidase doses in patients who experienced a reversible grade 1 or 2 hypersensitivity reaction.</p><p>• Pulmonary toxicity: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase administration can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Symptoms usually occur during or within 24 hours of trastuzumab/hyaluronidase administration. Discontinue trastuzumab/hyaluronidase for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Monitor patients until symptoms completely resolve. </b>Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive pulmonary tumor involvement, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe pulmonary toxicity.</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</b></i></p><p>• Chemotherapy: Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may increase the incidence of neutropenia when used in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The incidences of grades 3 and 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab (compared to those who received chemotherapy alone).</p><p><i><b>Special populations:</b></i></p><p>• Pregnancy: <b>[US Boxed Warning]: Exposure to trastuzumab/hyaluronidase during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.</b></p><p><i><b>Dosage form specific issues:</b></i></p><p>• Do not interchange: Trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and conventional trastuzumab products, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan, or pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase are <b>not</b> interchangeable. Verify product label prior to reconstitution and administration to prevent medication errors. Dosing and treatment schedules differ between trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and conventional trastuzumab (Herceptin or trastuzumab biosimilars), ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu), or pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase (Phesgo).</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• HER2 expression: Establish human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) status prior to treatment with an approved test, either HER2 protein overexpression by validated immunohistochemistry assay or gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. Tests appropriate for breast cancer should be used to assess HER2 status. Unreliable results may occur from improper assay performance, such as use of suboptimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents or to include appropriate controls for assay validation, or incorrectly following specific assay instructions. Information regarding HER2 diagnostic testing may be found at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Assess for HER2 overexpression and HER2 gene amplification by validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methodology (pretherapy) specific for breast cancer. Evaluate pregnancy status prior to treatment (in females of reproductive potential). Hepatitis B virus screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) prior to beginning systemic anticancer therapy (ASCO [Hwang 2020]). Conduct a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment prior to treatment initiation, including a history and physical examination. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline, every 3 months during treatment, and upon therapy completion, and if treatment is withheld for significant LVEF dysfunction, monitor LVEF at 4-week intervals. When used for adjuvant therapy, continue to monitor for cardiomyopathy and assess LVEF every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of treatment. Monitor closely for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity (particularly during the first dose) and/or pulmonary toxicity.</p><p>Additional cardiovascular monitoring (ASCO [Armenian 2017]): Screen for cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. In patients who develop signs/symptoms of cardiac dysfunction during therapy, an echocardiogram is recommended for diagnostic workup; if echocardiogram is not available or feasible, a cardiac MRI (preferred) or MUGA scan may be utilized; obtain serum cardiac biomarkers. Routine echocardiographic surveillance may be utilized in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving trastuzumab indefinitely.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: Advise patients of the risks of exposure to trastuzumab/hyaluronidase during pregnancy and the need for effective contraception.</b></p><p>Evaluate pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of therapy. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months after the last trastuzumab/hyaluronidase dose.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p><b>[US Boxed Warning]: Exposure to trastuzumab/hyaluronidase during pregnancy can result in oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death.
