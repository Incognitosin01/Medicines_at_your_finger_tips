</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Xopenex Inhalation Solution Concentrate</h2><p class="First">XOPENEX (levalbuterol HCl) Inhalation Solution Concentrate is indicated for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in adults, adolescents, and children 6 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease.</p><h2>Xopenex Inhalation Solution Concentrate Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Xopenex Inhalation Solution Concentrate is for oral inhalation only. Dilute with sterile normal saline before administration. Administer by nebulization using with a standard jet nebulizer (with a face mask or mouthpiece) connected to an air compressor. Do not exceed recommended dose. For dosages less than 1.25 mg, the non-concentrate (i.e., XOPENEX Inhalation Solution, 3 mL) formulation must be used.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Children 6 to 11 years old:</span> The recommended dosage of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution for patients 6 to 11 years old is 0.31 mg administered three times a day, by nebulization. Routine dosing should not exceed 0.63 mg three times a day.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Adults and Adolescents</span> <span class="Italics">≥</span><span class="Italics">12 years old:</span> The recommended starting dosage of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution for patients 12 years of age and older is 0.63 mg administered three times a day, every 6 to 8 hours, by nebulization.</p><p>Patients 12 years of age and older with more severe asthma or patients who do not respond adequately to a dose of 0.63 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution may benefit from a dosage of 1.25 mg three times a day.</p><p>Patients receiving the highest dose of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution should be monitored closely for adverse systemic effects, and the risks of such effects should be balanced against the potential for improved efficacy.</p><p>The use of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution can be continued as medically indicated to help control recurring bouts of bronchospasm. During this time, most patients gain optimal benefit from regular use of the inhalation solution.</p><p>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual response this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids.</p><p>The drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.</p><p>The safety and efficacy of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution have been established in clinical trials when administered using the PARI LC Jet™ and PARI LC Plus™ nebulizers, and the PARI Master<span class="Sup">®</span> Dura-Neb<span class="Sup">®</span> 2000 and Dura-Neb<span class="Sup">®</span> 3000 compressors. The safety and efficacy of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution when administered using other nebulizer systems have not been established.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Inhalation Solution Concentrate: 0.5 mL unit-dose vials containing 1.25 mg of levalbuterol that must be diluted before use. Xopenex Inhalation Solution Concentrate is available in cartons of 30 individually pouched vials.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">XOPENEX Inhalation Solution is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to levalbuterol or racemic albuterol. Reactions have included urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Paradoxical Bronchospasm</h3><p class="First">XOPENEX Inhalation Solution can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, XOPENEX Inhalation Solution should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm, when associated with inhaled formulations, frequently occurs with the first use of a new vial.</p><h3>Deterioration of Asthma</h3><p class="First">Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g., corticosteroids.</p><h3>Use of Anti-Inflammatory Agents</h3><p class="First">XOPENEX Inhalation Solution is not a substitute for corticosteroids. The use of beta-adrenergic agonist alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g., corticosteroids, to the therapeutic regimen.</p><h3>Cardiovascular Effects</h3><p class="First">XOPENEX Inhalation Solution, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients, as measured by heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the t-wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, XOPENEX Inhalation Solution, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</p><h3>Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose</h3><p class="First">Do not exceed the recommended dose. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma. The exact cause of death is unknown, but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected.</p><h3>Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of levalbuterol or racemic albuterol. Reactions have included urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema. The potential for hypersensitivity must be considered in the clinical evaluation of patients who experience immediate hypersensitivity reactions while receiving XOPENEX Inhalation Solution.</p><h3>Coexisting Conditions</h3><p class="First">XOPENEX Inhalation Solution, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias; in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after the use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.</p><p>Changes in blood glucose may occur. Large doses of intravenous racemic albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p><h3>Hypokalemia</h3><p class="First">As with other beta-adrenergic agonist medications, XOPENEX Inhalation Solution may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Paradoxical bronchospasm [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>]</li>
<li>Cardiovascular effects [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>]</li>
<li>Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.6)</span>]</li>
<li>Hypokalemia [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</span>]</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of the drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older</span></p><p>Adverse reaction information concerning XOPENEX Inhalation Solution in adults and adolescents is derived from one 4-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-, and placebo-controlled trial in 362 patients with asthma 12 years of age and older. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients receiving XOPENEX Inhalation Solution or racemic albuterol and more frequently than in patients receiving placebo are listed in Table 1.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> One treatment group, racemic albuterol 1.25 mg, with 68 subjects is omitted.</p><p>The incidence of certain systemic beta-adrenergic adverse reactions (e.g., tremor, nervousness) was slightly less in the XOPENEX Inhalation Solution 0.63 mg group compared with the other active treatment groups. The clinical significance of these small differences is unknown.</p><p>Changes in heart rate 15 minutes after drug administration and in plasma glucose and potassium 1 hour after drug administration on day 1 and day 29 were clinically comparable in the XOPENEX Inhalation Solution 1.25 mg and racemic albuterol 2.5 mg groups (see Table 2). Changes in heart rate and plasma glucose were slightly less in the XOPENEX Inhalation Solution 0.63 mg group compared with the other active treatment groups (see Table 2). The clinical significance of these small differences is unknown. After 4 weeks, effects on heart rate, plasma glucose, and plasma potassium were generally diminished compared with day 1 in all active treatment groups.</p><p>No other clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities related to administration of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution were observed in this study.</p><p>In the clinical trials, a slightly greater number of serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and clinically significant ECG changes were reported in patients who received XOPENEX 1.25 mg compared with the other active treatment groups.</p><p>The following adverse reactions, considered potentially related to XOPENEX, occurred in less than 2% of the 292 subjects who received XOPENEX and more frequently than in patients who received placebo in any clinical trial:</p><p>The following reactions, considered potentially related to XOPENEX, occurred in less than 2% of the treated subjects but at a frequency less than in patients who received placebo: asthma exacerbation, cough increased, wheezing, sweating, and vomiting.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age</span></p><p>Adverse reaction information concerning XOPENEX Inhalation Solution in pediatric patients is derived from one 3-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-, and placebo-controlled trial in 316 pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients in any treatment group and more frequently than in patients receiving placebo are listed in Table 3.</p><p class="First Footnote">Note: Subjects may have more than one adverse event per body system and preferred term.</p><p>Changes in heart rate, plasma glucose, and serum potassium are shown in Table 4. The clinical significance of these small differences is unknown.</p><h3>Post-marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">In addition to the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been observed in postapproval use of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness, their frequency of reporting, or their likely beta-mediated mechanism: angioedema, anaphylaxis, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles), asthma, chest pain, cough increased, dysphonia, dyspnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), metabolic acidosis, nausea, nervousness, rash, tachycardia, tremor, urticaria.</p><p>In addition, XOPENEX Inhalation Solution, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as hypertension, angina, vertigo, central nervous system stimulation, sleeplessness, headache, and drying or irritation of the oropharynx.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Short-Acting Bronchodilators</h3><p class="First">Avoid concomitant use of other short-acting sympathomimetic bronchodilators or epinephrine in patients being treated with XOPENEX Inhalation Solution. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.</p><h3>Beta-blockers</h3><p class="First">Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-adrenergic agonists such as XOPENEX Inhalation Solution, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</p><h3>Diuretics</h3><p class="First">The ECG changes or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop and thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium-sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.</p><h3>Digoxin</h3><p class="First">Mean decreases of 16% and 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of racemic albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving XOPENEX Inhalation Solution and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and XOPENEX Inhalation Solution.</p><h3>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants</h3><p class="First">XOPENEX Inhalation Solution should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of levalbuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Exposure Registry</span></p><p>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to asthma medication, including XOPENEX during pregnancy.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% respectively.</p><p class="First">Clinical Considerations</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</span></p><p>In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal control.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Labor or Delivery</span></p><p>Because of the potential for beta-adrenergic agonists to interfere with uterine contractility, the use of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution for the treatment of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk.</p><p>XOPENEX Inhalation Solution has not been approved for the management of preterm labor. The benefit-risk ratio when XOPENEX is administered for tocolysis has not been established. Serious adverse reactions, including maternal pulmonary edema, have been reported during or following treatment of premature labor with beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-agonists, including racemic albuterol.</p><p class="First">Data</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Animal Data</span></p><p>The oral administration of levalbuterol HCl to pregnant New Zealand White rabbits during the period of organogenesis found no evidence of teratogenicity at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 108 times the MRHDID of levalbuterol HCl for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). In a rat development study, racemic albuterol sulfate administered by inhalation did not produce any teratogenic effects at exposure approximately 63 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal dose of 10.5 mg/kg).</p><p>However, other developmental studies with the racemic albuterol sulfate, did result in teratogenic effects in mice and rabbits at doses slightly higher than the human therapeutic range. In a rabbit developmental study, orally administered albuterol sulfate induced cranioschisis in 7 of 19 fetuses (37%) at approximately 215 times the MRHDID for adults (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal dose of 50 mg/kg). In a mouse developmental study, subcutaneously administered albuterol sulfate produced cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at an exposure approximately 0.3 times the MRHDID for adults (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day) and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at approximately 3 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at a maternal dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day). Similar effects were not observed at approximately 0.03 times the MRHDID for adults on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis at maternal dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day (i.e., less than the therapeutic dose). Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with isoproterenol (positive control).</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on the presence of levalbuterol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.</p><p>The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for XOPENEX Inhalation Solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from XOPENEX Inhalation Solution or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Pediatric Patients 6 Years of Age and Older</span></p><p>The safety and efficacy of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older in an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial [see <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)</span>].</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Pediatric Patients less than 6 Years of Age</span></p><p>XOPENEX Inhalation Solution is not indicated for pediatric patients less than 6 years of age.</p><p>Clinical trials with XOPENEX Inhalation Solution in this age group failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoint and demonstrated an increased number of asthma-related adverse reactions following chronic XOPENEX treatment.</p><p>XOPENEX Inhalation Solution was studied in 379 pediatric patients less than 6 years of age with asthma or reactive airway disease – (291patients 2 to 5 years of age, and 88 patients from birth to less than 2 years of age). Efficacy and safety data for XOPENEX Inhalation Solution in this age group are primarily available from one 3-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1) in 211 pediatric patients between the ages of 2 and 5 years, of whom 119 received XOPENEX Inhalation Solution. Over the 3 week treatment period, there were no significant treatment differences in the Pediatric Asthma Questionnaire (PAQ) total score between groups receiving XOPENEX Inhalation Solution 0.31 mg, XOPENEX Inhalation Solution 0.63 mg, racemic albuterol, and placebo. Additional safety data following chronic dosing is available from a 4-week, multicenter, randomized, modified-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 2) of 196 patients between the ages of birth and 3 years, of whom 63 received open-label XOPENEX Inhalation Solution. In these two studies, treatment-emergent asthma exacerbations or asthma-related adverse reactions and treatment discontinuations due to asthma occurred at a higher frequency in XOPENEX Inhalation-treated subjects compared to control (Table 5). Other adverse reactions were consistent with those observed in the clinical trial population of patients 6 years of age and older <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p class="First Footnote">*Asthma exacerbation defined as worsening of asthma symptoms or pulmonary function that required any of the following: emergency department visit, hospitalization, therapeutic intervention with oral or parenteral steroids, unscheduled clinic visit to treat acute asthma symptoms</p><p class="First Footnote">**Includes the following Preferred Terms (whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug): asthma, cough, hypoxia, status asthmaticus, tachypnea</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Only 5 patients 65 years of age and older were treated with XOPENEX Inhalation Solution in a 4-week clinical study [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12)</span> and <span class="Italics">Clinical Studies (14)</span>] (n=2 for 0.63 mg and n=3 for 1.25 mg). In these patients, bronchodilation was observed after the first dose on day 1 and after 4 weeks of treatment. In general, patients 65 years of age and older should be started at a dose of 0.63 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution. If clinically warranted due to insufficient bronchodilator response, the dose of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution may be increased in elderly patients as tolerated, in conjunction with frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring, to the maximum recommended daily dose [see <span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2)</span>].</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Albuterol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation and/or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms listed under <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions (6)</span>, e.g., seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min., arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and sleeplessness. Hypokalemia also may occur. As with all sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with the abuse of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution. Treatment consists of discontinuation of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution together with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardio selective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution.</p><h2>Xopenex Inhalation Solution Concentrate Description</h2><p class="First">Xopenex Inhalation Solution Concentrate is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free solution of the hydrochloride salt of levalbuterol, the (R)-enantiomer of the drug substance racemic albuterol. Levalbuterol HCl is a relatively selective beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptor agonist [see <span class="Italics">Clinical Pharmacology (12)</span>]. The chemical name for levalbuterol HCl is (R)-α<span class="Sup">1</span>-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]methyl]-4-hydroxy-1,3-benzenedimethanol hydrochloride, and its established chemical structure is as follows:</p><p></p><p>The molecular weight of levalbuterol HCl is 275.8, and its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">13</span>H<span class="Sub">21</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span>•HCl. It is a white to off-white, crystalline solid, with a melting point of approximately 187°C and solubility of approximately 180 mg/mL in water.</p><p>Levalbuterol HCl is the USAN modified name for (R)-albuterol HCl in the United States.</p><p>Xopenex Inhalation Solution Concentrate is supplied in 0.5 mL unit-dose vials that must be diluted with normal saline before administration by nebulization. Each 0.5 mL unit-dose vial contains 1.25 mg of levalbuterol (as 1.44 mg of levalbuterol HCl), sodium chloride to adjust tonicity, and hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH to 4.0 (3.3 to 4.5).</p><h2>Xopenex Inhalation Solution Concentrate - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Activation of beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3´, 5´-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The increase in cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein kinase A, which in turn inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation. Levalbuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway. Levalbuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges. While it is recognized that beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta-receptors in the human heart, 10% to 50% of which are beta<span class="Sub">2</span>-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established [see <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</span>]. However, all beta-adrenergic agonist drugs can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and Adolescents</span> <span class="Bold">≥</span><span class="Bold">12 Years Old</span></p><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 20 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma received single doses of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution (0.31 mg, 0.63 mg, and 1.25 mg) and racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (2.5 mg). All doses of active treatment produced a significantly greater degree of bronchodilation (as measured by percent change from pre-dose mean FEV<span class="Sub">1</span>) than placebo, and there were no significant differences between any of the active treatment arms. The bronchodilator responses to 1.25 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution and 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution were clinically comparable over the 6-hour evaluation period, except for a slightly longer duration of action (&gt;15% increase in FEV<span class="Sub">1</span> from baseline) after administration of 1.25 mg of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution. Systemic beta-adrenergic adverse effects were observed with all active doses and were generally dose-related for (R)-albuterol. XOPENEX Inhalation Solution at a dose of 1.25 mg produced a slightly higher rate of systemic beta-adrenergic adverse effects than the 2.5 mg dose of racemic albuterol sulfate inhalation solution.</p><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 12 adults with mild-to-moderate asthma were challenged with inhaled methacholine chloride 20 and 180 minutes following administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg of racemic albuterol sulfate, 1.25 mg of XOPENEX, 1.25 mg of (S)-albuterol, or placebo using a Pari LC Jet™ nebulizer. Racemic albuterol sulfate, XOPENEX, and (S)-albuterol had a protective effect against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction 20 minutes after administration, although the effect of (S)-albuterol was minimal.

When racemic albuterol was administered either intravenously or via inhalation after oral charcoal administration, there was a 3- to 4-fold difference in the area under the concentration-time curves between the (R)- and (S)-albuterol enantiomers, with (S)-albuterol concentrations being consistently higher. However, without charcoal pretreatment, after either oral or inhalation administration the differences were 8- to 24-fold, suggesting that (R)-albuterol is preferentially metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract, presumably by SULT1A3.</p><p>The primary route of elimination of albuterol enantiomers is through renal excretion (80% to 100%) of either the parent compound or the primary metabolite. Less than 20% of the drug is detected in the feces. Following intravenous administration of racemic albuterol, between 25% and 46% of the (R)-albuterol fraction of the dose was excreted as unchanged (R)-albuterol in the urine.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Special Populations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of XOPENEX Inhalation Solution has not been evaluated.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of racemic albuterol was evaluated in 5 subjects with creatinine clearance of 7 to 53 mL/min, and the results were compared with those from healthy volunteers.
