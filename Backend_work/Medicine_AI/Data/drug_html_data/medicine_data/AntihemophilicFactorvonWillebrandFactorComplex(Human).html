Patients who develop antibodies against von Willebrand factor will not have an effective clinical response to therapy and infusions may result in anaphylactic reactions; these patients should be managed by an experienced physician and alternatives to therapy should be considered. Patients with hemophilia should have an appropriate laboratory assessment if expected factor VIII plasma levels are not attained or if bleeding is not controlled following an adequate dose. Any patient who has an inadequate response to therapy or a severe adverse reaction should be evaluated for the presence of inhibitors.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions have been observed, including anaphylaxis and shock (with or without fever). Monitor patients closely during infusion; if allergic symptoms occur, discontinue administration and initiate treatment immediately. Patients experiencing anaphylactic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of inhibitors.</p><p>• Thrombotic events: Thromboembolic events have been reported; especially in patients with known risk factors for thrombosis. Risk of thromboembolic events may be increased in female patients, patients with endogenous high concentrations of factor VIII, and in patients who receive continued treatment resulting in an excessive rise in factor VIII activity; monitor concentrations of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII closely. Use with caution and consider antithrombotic measures when treating patients with von Willebrand disease that are at an increased risk for thrombosis.</p><p>• Vasomotor reactions: Rapid administration may result in vasomotor reactions; do not exceed administration rate recommendations.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Albumin: Products vary by preparation method; some final formulations may contain human albumin.</p><p>• Blood types A, B, and AB: Alphanate and Humate-P contain trace amounts of blood groups A and B isohemagglutinins; use caution when large or frequently repeated doses are given to individuals with blood groups A, B, and AB. Monitor patients for signs of intravascular hemolysis and falling hematocrit; discontinue therapy and consider administration of serologically compatible type O red blood cells if progressive hemolytic anemia occurs.</p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents (eg, viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [vCJD], theoretically the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD]) that could transmit disease. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer. Hepatitis A and B vaccination is recommended for all patients receiving plasma derivatives.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Dosage requirements will vary in patients with factor VIII inhibitors; optimal treatment should be determined by the extent of bleeding, presence of inhibitors, and clinical response. Frequency of use is determined by the severity of the disorder or bleeding pattern.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Heart rate and blood pressure (before and during administration); AHF concentrations prior to and during treatment; in patients with circulating inhibitors, the inhibitor concentration should be monitored; hematocrit; monitor for signs and symptoms of intravascular hemolysis; bleeding; VWF activity (circulating levels of functional VWF are measured as ristocetin cofactor activity [VWF:RCo]). In surgical patients, monitor VWF:RCo at baseline and after surgery, trough VWF:RCo and FVIII:C at least daily; hypersensitivity reactions during infusion.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Pregnant hemophilia A carriers and those with von Willebrand disease may have an increased bleeding risk following abortion, invasive procedures, miscarriage, and delivery; close surveillance is recommended. Factor VIII concentrations may increase in pregnant patients; changes in von Willebrand factor levels may vary during pregnancy depending on type. Patients should be monitored at the first antenatal visit, once or twice during the third trimester, prior to surgical or invasive procedures, and at delivery. Replacement is recommended if concentrations are &lt;0.5 IU/mL and any of the following occur: need for invasive procedures (including delivery), spontaneous miscarriage, insertion and removal of epidural catheters, or active bleeding. Hemostatic concentrations should be maintained for at least 3 to 5 days following invasive procedures or postpartum. When VWF replacement therapy is needed, a recombinant product or a product made from a safe plasma source with viral testing that contains both factor VIII and von Willebrand factor is recommended. A recombinant product is one of the preferred agents if prophylaxis or treatment is needed for hemophilia A during pregnancy (NHF 2017; RCOG [Pavord 2017]; WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat von Willebrand disease.</p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent bleeding.</p><p>• Some products are used to treat hemophilia.</p><p>• It may be given for other reasons.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
