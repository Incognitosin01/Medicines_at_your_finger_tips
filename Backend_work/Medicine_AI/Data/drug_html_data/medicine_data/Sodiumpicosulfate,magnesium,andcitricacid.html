Sodium picosulfate, magnesium, and citric acid is a laxative. It works by causing you to have diarrhea to clean your colon. Cleaning your colon will help your doctor see inside of it more clearly during colonoscopy.</p><p>Sodium picosulfate, magnesium, and citric acid is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using sodium picosulfate, magnesium, and citric acid</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For sodium picosulfate, magnesium, and citric acid, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to sodium picosulfate, magnesium, and citric acid or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of <i>Clenpiq®</i> and <i>Prepopik®</i> in children younger than 9 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of citric acid, magnesium oxide, and sodium picosulfate combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, and unwanted effects (eg, fluid or electrolyte imbalance), which may require caution in patients receiving sodium picosulfate, magnesium, and citric acid.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking sodium picosulfate, magnesium, and citric acid, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using sodium picosulfate, magnesium, and citric acid with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.
