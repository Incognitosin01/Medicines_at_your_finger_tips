</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Oxymorphone Tablets</h2><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use</span></p><p>Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>, reserve oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]:</p><ul>
<li>Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated,</li>
<li>Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia</li>
</ul><h2>Oxymorphone Tablets Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Dosage and Administration Instructions</h3><p class="First">Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5)]</span>.</p><p>Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly <span class="Italics">[see Warnings </span><span class="Italics">and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p>Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>To avoid medication errors, prescribers and pharmacists must be aware that oxymorphone is available as both immediate-release 5 mg and 10 mg tablets and extended-release 5 mg and 10 mg tablets <span class="Italics">[see Dosage </span><span class="Italics">Forms and Strengths (3)]</span>.</p><h3>Initial Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets as the first Opioid Analgesic</span></p><p>Initiate treatment with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a dosing range of 10 to 20 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain.</p><p>Do not initiate treatment with doses higher than 20 mg because of the potential serious adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Other Opioids to Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets</span></p><p>There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.</p><p>For conversion from other opioids to oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, physicians and other healthcare professionals are advised to refer to published relative potency information, keeping in mind that conversion ratios are only approximate. In general, it is safest to start oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy by administering half of the calculated total daily dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in 4 to 6 equally divided doses, every 4-6 hours. The initial dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Parenteral Oxymorphone to Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets</span></p><p>Given oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets absolute oral bioavailability of approximately 10%, patients receiving parenteral oxymorphone may be converted to oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets by administering 10 times the patient’s total daily parenteral oxymorphone dose as oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, in four or six equally divided doses (e.g., [IV dose x 10] divided by 4 or 6). For example, approximately 10 mg of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets four times daily may be required to provide pain relief equivalent to a total daily IM dose of 4 mg oxymorphone. Due to patient variability with regard to opioid analgesic response, upon conversion patients should be closely monitored to ensure adequate analgesia and to minimize side effects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Conversion from Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets to Extended-Release Oxymorphone</span></p><p>The relative bioavailability of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets compared to extended-release oxymorphone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release tablets must be accompanied by close observation for signs of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Mild Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.</p><p>Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment, starting with the lowest dose (e.g., 5 mg) and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Use oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with caution in patients with creatinine clearance rates less than 50 mL/min., starting with the lowest dose (e.g., 5 mg) and titrating slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology</span><span class="Italics">(12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications in Geriatric Patients</h3><p class="First">Exercise caution in the selection of the starting dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets for an elderly patient by starting with the lowest dose (e.g., 5 mg) and titrate slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5</span>)<span class="Italics">]</span>.</p><h3>Dosage Modifications with Concomitant Use of Central Nervous System Depressants</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like all opioid analgesics, should be started at one-third to one-half of the usual dose in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system (CNS) depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers, and alcohol, because respiratory depression, hypotension and profound sedation, coma or death may result <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and </span><span class="Italics">Drug Interactions (7)]</span>. When combined therapy with any of the above medications is considered, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.</p><h3>Titration and Maintenance of Therapy</h3><p class="First">Individually titrate oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span> Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.</p><p>If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.</p><h3>Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</p><p>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</p><p>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</p><p>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</p><p>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.13), Drug Abuse </span><span class="Italics">and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Tablets 5 mg: White to off white round flat tablets de-bossed with <span class="Bold">‘T 277’</span> on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>Tablets 10 mg: Pink round flat tablets de-bossed with <span class="Bold">‘T 278’</span> on one side and plain on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul>
<li>Significant respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
<li>Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span></li>
<li>Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]</span></li>

<li>Moderate or severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablet contains oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [<span class="Italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</span>].</p><p>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</p><p>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, and monitor all patients receiving oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse.</p><p>Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</p><h3>Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)</h3><p class="First">To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:</p><ul>
<li>Complete a <span class="Bold">REMS-compliant education program</span> offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</li>
<li>Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: <span class="Bold">www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG</span>.</li>
<li>Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.</li>
<li>Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.</li>
</ul><p>To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to <span class="Bold">www.opioidanalgesicrems.com</span>. The FDA Blueprint can be found at <span class="Bold">www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint</span>.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</h3><p class="First">Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <span class="Italics">[see </span><span class="Italics">Overdosage (10)]</span>. Carbon dioxide (CO<span class="Sub">2</span>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</p><p>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets.</p><p>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are essential [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2)</span>]. Overestimating the oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</p><p>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxymorphone.</p><p>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and </span><span class="Italics">Administration (2.8)]</span>.</p><h3>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Prolonged use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), </span><span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants</h3><p class="First">Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><p>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)]</span>.</p><p>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.</p><p>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when oxymorphone hydrochloride tablet is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7), </span><span class="Italics">Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h3>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debiliated Patients</h3><p class="First">The use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.</p><p><span class="Bold">Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease:</span> oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets -treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients:</span> Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets and when oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.</p><h3>Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have occurred in patients treated with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in the postmarket setting. The most commonly described clinical features in these reports were swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, lips, tongue, hands, and/or throat; dyspnea; hives, pruritus, and/or rash; and nausea/vomiting. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets immediately, discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of oxymorphone. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information</span><span class="Italics">(17)]</span>.</p><h3>Adrenal Insufficiency</h3><p class="First">Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</p><h3>Severe Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Drug Interactions</span><span class="Italics">(7)].</span> Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness</h3><p class="First">In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<span class="Sub">2</span> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets.</p><p>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.</p><h3>Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.</p><p>The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders</h3><p class="First">The oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets therapy.</p><h3>Withdrawal</h3><p class="First">Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of oxymorphone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</span>.</p><p>Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets.

An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Pregnant rats were treated with oxymorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 5, 10, or 25 mg/kg/day (2.4, 4.9, or 12.2 times the HDD based on body surface area, respectively).

Efficacy was not demonstrated in this population treated with doses expected to be comparable to effective starting doses in adults. In addition, pharmacokinetic results demonstrated that treatment with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets resulted in substantially higher systemic exposures to oxymorphone in 2 out of 24 patients.</p><p>Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use in the pediatric population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, 31% were 65 and over, while 7% were 75 and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. There were several adverse events that were more frequently observed in subjects 65 and over compared to younger subjects. These adverse events included dizziness, somnolence, confusion, and nausea. In general, dose selection for elderly patients should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <span class="Italics">[see Warnings </span><span class="Italics">and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Oxymorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because the elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In a study of extended-release Oxymorphone Tablets, patients with mild hepatic impairment were shown to have an increase in bioavailability compared to the subjects with normal hepatic function. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution in patients with mild impairment. These patients should be started with the lowest dose (5 mg) and titrated slowly while carefully monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated for patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions</span><span class="Italics">(5.15), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In a study of extended-release Oxymorphone Tablets, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment were shown to have an increase in bioavailability compared to the subjects with normal renal function <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Such patients should be started with the lowest dose (5 mg) and titrated slowly while monitoring for signs of respiratory and central nervous system depression <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.4) Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Drug Abuse and Dependence</h2><h3>Controlled Substance</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets contains oxymorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance.</p><h3>Abuse</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets contains oxymorphone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone and tapentadol. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and </span><span class="Italics">Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p><p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p><p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.</p><p>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control.</p><p>Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.</p><p>Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</p><p>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</p><p><span class="Bold">Risks Specific to Abuse of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Tablets</span></p><p>Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets is for oral use only. Abuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets poses a risk of overdose and death. This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.</p><p>Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.</p><h3>Dependence</h3><p class="First">Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during chronic opioid therapy. Tolerance is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect such as analgesia (in the absence of disease progression or other external factors). Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p><p>Physical dependence is a physiological state in which the body adapts to the drug after a period of regular exposure, resulting in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug. Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued opioid usage.</p><p>Do not abruptly discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</p><p>When discontinuing oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for a long duration at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Warnings and Precautions </span><span class="Italics">(5.13)]</span>.</p><p>Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific </span><span class="Italics">Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Presentation</span></p><p>Acute overdose with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations <span class="Italics">[see Clinical </span><span class="Italics">Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Treatment of Overdose</span></p><p>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support techniques.</p><p>The opioid antagonists, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to oxymorphone overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to Oxymorphone overdose.</p><p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxymorphone in oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</p><p>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p><h2>Oxymorphone Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablet, USP is an opioid agonist available in 5 mg and 10 mg tablet strengths for oral administration. The chemical name for oxymorphone hydrochloride is 4, 5α-epoxy-3, 14-dihydroxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-one hydrochloride. The molecular weight is 337.80. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">17</span>H<span class="Sub">19</span>NO<span class="Sub">4</span>.HCl and it has the following chemical structure.</p><p></p><p>Oxymorphone hydrochloride, USP is white to off white powder, which is soluble in water, sparingly soluble in alcohol and ether.</p><p>The inactive ingredients in oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, USP include: lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized starch. In addition, the 10 mg tablets contain D&amp;C red No. 30 talc lake.</p><p>USP Dissolution Test Pending.</p><h2>Oxymorphone Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Oxymorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxymorphone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxymorphone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</p><p>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Effects on the Central Nervous System</span></p><p>Oxymorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</p><p>Oxymorphone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle</span></p><p>Oxymorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Cardiovascular System</span></p><p>Oxymorphone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Endocrine System</span></p><p>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</p><p>Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on the Immune System</span></p><p>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Efficacy Relationships</span></p><p>The minimum effective analgesic concentration varies widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent agonist opioids The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxymorphone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance <span class="Italics">[see </span><span class="Italics">Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships</span></p><p>There is a relationship between increasing oxymorphone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.6)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The absolute oral bioavailability of oxymorphone is approximately 10%. Studies in healthy volunteers reveal predictable relationships between oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage and plasma oxymorphone concentrations.</p><p>Steady-state levels were achieved after three days of multiple dose administration. Under both single-dose and steady-state conditions, dose proportionality has been established for 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg doses of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, for both peak plasma levels (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) and extent of absorption (AUC) (see Table 3).</p><p></p><p>After oral dosing with 40 mg of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in healthy volunteers under fasting conditions or with a high-fat meal, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC were increased by approximately 38% in fed subjects relative to fasted subjects. As a result, oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets should be dosed at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and </span><span class="Italics">Administration (2.1)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Formal studies on the distribution of oxymorphone in various tissues have not been conducted. Oxymorphone is not extensively bound to human plasma proteins; binding is in the range of 10% to 12%.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>Half-life ranges from approximately 9-11 hours after a single oral dose (5-40 mg).</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism</span></p><p>Oxymorphone is highly metabolized, principally in the liver, and undergoes reduction or conjugation with glucuronic acid to form both active and inactive products. The two major metabolites of Oxymorphone are oxymorphone-3-glucuronide and 6-OH-oxymorphone. The mean plasma AUC for oxymorphone-3-glucuronide is approximately 90-fold higher than the parent compound. The pharmacologic activity of the glucuronide metabolite has not been evaluated. 6-OH-oxymorphone has been shown in animal studies to have analgesic bioactivity. The mean plasma 6-OH-oxymorphone AUC is approximately 70% of the oxymorphone AUC following single oral doses but is essentially equivalent to the parent compound at steady-state.</p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion</span></p><p>Because oxymorphone is extensively metabolized, &lt;1% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. On average, 33% to 38% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as oxymorphone-3-glucuronide and 0.25% to 0.62% is excreted as 6-OH-oxymorphone in subjects with normal hepatic and renal function. In animals given radiolabeled oxymorphone, approximately 90% of the administered radioactivity was recovered within 5 days of dosing. The majority of oxymorphone-derived radioactivity was found in the urine and feces.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Age: Geriatric Population</span></p><p>The plasma levels of oxymorphone administered as an extended-release tablet were about 40% higher in elderly (≥65 years of age) than in younger subjects <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">Sex:</span></p><p>The effect of sex on the pharmacokinetics of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets has not been studied. In a study with an extended-release formulation of oxymorphone, there was a consistent tendency for female subjects to have slightly higher AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> values than male subjects. However, sex differences were not observed when AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span> and C<span class="Sub">max</span> were adjusted by body weight.</p><p><span class="Italics">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>The liver plays an important role in the pre-systemic clearance of orally administered oxymorphone. Accordingly, the bioavailability of orally administered oxymorphone may be markedly increased in patients with moderate to severe liver disease. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets has not been studied. However, in a study with an extended-release formulation of oxymorphone, the disposition of oxymorphone was compared in 6 patients with mild, 5 patients with moderate, and one patient with severe hepatic impairment, and 12 subjects with normal hepatic function. The bioavailability of oxymorphone was increased by 1.6-fold in patients with mild hepatic impairment and by 3.7-fold in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In one patient with severe hepatic impairment, the bioavailability was increased by 12.2-fold. The half-life of oxymorphone was not significantly affected by hepatic impairment.</p><p><span class="Italics">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets has not been studied. However, in a study with an extended-release formulation of oxymorphone, an increase of 26%, 57%, and 65% in oxymorphone bioavailability was observed in mild (creatinine clearance 51-80 mL/min; n=8), moderate (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min; n=8), and severe (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min; n=8) patients, respectively, compared to healthy controls.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions Studies</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies revealed little to no biotransformation of oxymorphone to 6-OH-oxymorphone by any of the major cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) isoforms at therapeutically relevant oxymorphone plasma concentrations.</p><p>No inhibition of any of the major CYP P450 isoforms was observed when oxymorphone was incubated with human liver microsomes at concentrations of ≤50 μM. An inhibition of CYP 3A4 activity occurred at oxymorphone concentrations ≥150 μM. Therefore, it is not expected that oxymorphone, or its metabolites will act as inhibitors of any of the major CYP P450 enzymes <span class="Italics">in vivo</span>.</p><p>Increases in the activity of the CYP 2C9 and CYP 3A4 isoforms occurred when oxymorphone was incubated with human hepatocytes. However, clinical drug interaction studies with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets ER showed no induction of CYP450 3A4 or 2C9 enzyme activity, indicating that no dose adjustment for CYP 3A4- or 2C9-mediated drug-drug interactions is required.</p><p><span class="Italics">Alcohol Interaction</span></p><p>The effect of co-ingestion of alcohol with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets has not been evaluated. However, an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> study was performed to evaluate the effect of alcohol (40%, 20%, 4% and 0%) on the bioavailability of a single dose of 40 mg of extended-release Oxymorphone Tablets in healthy, fasted volunteers. Following concomitant administration of 240 mL of 40% ethanol the C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased on average by 70% and up to 270% in individual subjects. Following the concomitant administration of 240 mL of 20% ethanol, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased on average by 31% and up to 260% in individual subjects. In some individuals there was also a decrease in oxymorphone peak plasma concentrations. No effect on the release of Oxymorphone from the extended-release tablet was noted in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> alcohol interaction study. The mechanism of the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> interaction is unknown. Therefore, avoid co-administration of oxymorphone and ethanol.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in long-term animal studies in mice and rats. Oxymorphone hydrochloride was administered to Sprague Dawley rats (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day in males and 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/day in females) for 2 years by oral gavage. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the highest doses tested in male and female rats was 4.8 times and 21.2 times the human exposure at a dose of 20 mg/day, respectively. Oxymorphone hydrochloride was administered to male and female CD-1 mice (10, 25, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day) for 2 years by oral gavage. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at 150 mg/kg/day in male and female mice was 205 times and 243 times the human exposure at a dose of 20 mg/day, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Oxymorphone hydrochloride was not mutagenic when tested in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), or in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> mammalian cell chromosome aberration assay performed with human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tested positive in both the rat and mouse <span class="Italics">in </span><span class="Italics">vivo</span> micronucleus assays. An increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes occurred in mice given doses of ≥250 mg/kg and in rats given doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg. A subsequent study demonstrated that oxymorphone hydrochloride was not aneugenic in mice following administration of up to 500 mg/kg. Additional studies indicate that the increased incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in rats may be secondary to increased body temperature following oxymorphone administration. Doses associated with increased micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes also produce a marked, rapid increase in body temperature. Pretreatment of animals with sodium salicylate minimized the increase in body temperature and prevented the increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes after administration of 40 mg/kg oxymorphone.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of fertility</span></p><p>Female rats were treated with oxymorphone hydrochloride beginning 14 days prior to mating through Gestation Day 7 via oral gavage doses of 5, 10, or 25 mg/kg/day (2.4, 4.9, or 12.2 times the human daily dose of 20 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Male rats were treated via oral gavage with the same oxymorphone hydrochloride doses beginning 28 days prior to and throughout mating. In female rats, an increase in the length of the estrus cycle and decrease in the mean number of viable embryos, implantation sites and corpora lutea were observed at 4.9 times the human dose of 20 mg/day. No adverse effects of oxymorphone on male reproductive function or sperm parameters were observed.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The analgesic efficacy of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets has been evaluated in acute pain following orthopedic and abdominal surgeries.</p><h3>Orthopedic Surgery</h3><p class="First">Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging studies in patients with acute moderate to severe pain following orthopedic surgery evaluated the doses of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets 10 mg and 20 mg, and 30 mg was included in one study. Both studies demonstrated that oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets 20 mg provided greater analgesia as measured by total pain relief based on a weighted analysis over 8 hours using a 0-4 categorical, compared to placebo. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets 10 mg provided greater analgesia as compared to placebo in one of the two studies. There was no evidence of superiority of the 30 mg dose over the 20 mg dose. However, there was a high rate of naloxone use in patients receiving the oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets 30 mg dose in the postoperative period [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and </span><span class="Italics">Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><h3>Abdominal Surgery</h3><p class="First">In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study, the efficacy of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets 10 mg and 20 mg was assessed in patients with moderate to severe acute pain following abdominal surgery. In this study, patients were dosed every 4 to 6 hours over a 48-hour treatment period. Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets 10 and 20 mg provided greater analgesia, as measured by the mean average pain intensity on a 0-100 mm visual analog scale, over 48 hours, compared to placebo [<span class="Italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2)</span>].</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets, USP are supplied as follows:</p><p><span class="Bold">5 mg Tablet:</span></p><p>White to off white round flat tablets de-bossed with <span class="Bold">‘T 277’</span> on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>Bottles of 100 tablets with child-resistant closure                        NDC 72865-130-01</p><p><span class="Bold">10 mg Tablet:</span></p><p>Pink round flat tablets de-bossed with <span class="Bold">‘T 278’</span> on one side and plain on the other side.</p><p>Bottles of 100 tablets with child-resistant closure                        NDC 72865-131-01</p><p>Store at 20°C - 25°C (68° to 77°F); [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].</p><p>Dispense in tight container as defined in the USP, with a child-resistant closure (as required).</p><p>Store oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets securely and dispose of properly <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</span>.</p><h2>Patient Counseling Information</h2><p class="First">Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).</p><p><span class="Bold">Storage and Disposal</span>:</p><p>Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence </span><span class="Italics">(9.2)]</span>.
