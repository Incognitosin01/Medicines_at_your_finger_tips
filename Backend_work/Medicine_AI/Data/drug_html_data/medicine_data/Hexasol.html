Each mL contains 300 mg of oxytetracycline base as amphoteric oxytetracycline; 20 mg of flunixin base as flunixin meglumine, 40% (v/v) glycerol formal, 10% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 200, 2.7% (w/v) magnesium oxide, 0.4% (w/v) sodium formaldehyde sulphoxylate (as a preservative) and monoethanolamine (as required to adjust pH).</p><h2>INDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">For the treatment of bacterial pneumonia associated with <span class="Italics">Pasteurella</span> spp. and for the control of associated pyrexia in beef and non-lactating dairy cattle.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">Administer Hexasol Injection once as an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of 1 mL per 22 lb body weight (13.6 mg oxytetracycline and 0.9 mg flunixin per lb BW). Do not administer more than 10 mL per injection site (1 to 2 mL per site in small calves). Hexasol Injection is recommended where retreatment of calves and yearlings is impractical due to husbandry conditions, such as cattle on range, or where their repeated restraint is inadvisable.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Do not use in animals showing hypersensitivity to either flunixin meglumine or oxytetracycline.</p><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:</h2><h3>Withdrawal Periods and Residue Warnings</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Residue Warnings:</span> Discontinue treatment at least 21 days prior to slaughter of cattle. Do not use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older. Use in this class of cattle may cause milk residues. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal. Use of dosages other than those indicated may result in residue violations.</p><p>Exceeding the highest recommended level of drug per pound of bodyweight per day, administering more than the recommended number of treatments, and/or exceeding 10 mL intramuscularly or subcutaneously per injection site in beef cattle and non-lactating dairy cattle may result in antibiotic residues beyond the withdrawal time.</p><h3>Antibacterial Warnings</h3><p class="First">Use of antibacterial drugs in the absence of a susceptible bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to treated animals and may increase the risk of the development of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.</p><p>As with all antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. The absence of a favorable response following treatment or the development of new signs or symptoms may suggest an overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. If superinfections occur, the use of this product should be discontinued and appropriate specific therapy should be instituted. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving Hexasol Injection in conjunction with penicillin.</p><h3>User Safety Warnings</h3><p class="First">Not for use in humans. Keep out of reach of children.</p><p>The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information. To obtain an MSDS contact Norbrook at 1-866-591-5777.</p><h3>Animal Safety Warnings and Precautions</h3><p class="First">At the first sign of any adverse reaction, discontinue use of the product. Some of the reactions may be attributable either to anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction) or to cardiovascular collapse of unknown cause.</p><p>Shortly after injection, treated animals may have transient hemoglobinuria resulting in darkened urine. Intramuscular injection in the rump area may cause mild temporary lameness associated with swelling at the injection site.</p><p>As a class, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory NSAIDs may be associated with gastrointestinal, renal and hepatic toxicity. Sensitivity to drug-associated adverse effects varies with the individual patient. Patients at greatest risk for adverse events are those that are dehydrated, on diuretic therapy, or those with existing renal, cardiovascular, and/or hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent administration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be carefully approached. NSAIDs may inhibit the prostaglandins that maintain normal homeostatic function. Such anti-prostaglandin effects may result in clinically significant disease in patients with underlying or pre-existing disease that has not been previously diagnosed. Since many NSAIDs possess the potential to produce gastrointestinal ulceration, concomitant use of Hexasol Injection with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or corticosteroids, should be avoided or closely monitored.</p><p>Flunixin is a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory NSAID, and as with others in this class, adverse effects may occur with its use. The most frequently reported adverse effects have been gastrointestinal signs. Events involving suspected renal, hematologic, neurologic, dermatologic, and hepatic effects have also been reported for other drugs in this class.</p><p>Not for use in animals intended for breeding purposes. The effects of oxytetracycline and flunixin on bovine reproductive performance, pregnancy, and lactation have not been determined. NSAIDs are known to have potential effects on both parturition and the estrous cycle. There may be a delay in the onset of estrus if flunixin is administered during the prostaglandin phase of the estrous cycle. The effects of flunixin on imminent parturition have not been evaluated in a controlled study. NSAIDs are known to have the potential to delay parturition through a tocolytic effect.</p><h3>Other Warnings</h3><p class="First">Hexasol Injection, when administered as directed, may induce a transient reaction at the site of injection and underlying tissues that may result in trim loss of edible tissue at slaughter.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">At the first sign of any adverse reaction, discontinue use of the product. Reports of adverse reactions associated with oxytetracycline administration include injection site swelling, restlessness, ataxia, trembling, swelling of eyelids, ears, muzzle, anus and vulva (or scrotum and sheath in males), respiratory abnormalities (labored breathing), frothing at the mouth, collapse and possibly death. Some of these reactions may be attributed either to anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction) or to cardiovascular collapse of unknown cause. After flunixin administration in cattle, anaphylactic-like reactions have been reported, some of which have been fatal, primarily following intravenous use.</p><h2>CONTACT INFORMATION:</h2><p class="First">For technical assistance, contact Norbrook at 1-866-591-5777.

The antibiotic activity of oxytetracycline is not appreciably diminished in the presence of body fluids, serum or exudates. Studies have shown that the half-life of oxytetracycline in blood following intramuscular treatment with Hexasol at 5 mg per pound of bodyweight is approximately 23 hours in cattle. Studies have shown when Hexasol Injection is administered once intramuscularly or subcutaneously to cattle at 13.6 mg per pound of bodyweight, blood oxytetracycline concentration of greater than 0.2 μg/mL have been observed for at least 7 to 8 days.</p><p>Flunixin meglumine is a weak acid (pKa=5.82)<span class="Sup">1</span> which exhibits a high degree of plasma protein binding (approximately 99%).<span class="Sup">2</span> However, free (unbound) drug appears to readily partition into body tissues (Vss predictions range from 297 to 782 mL/kg.<span class="Sup">2-5</span> Total body water is approximately equal to 570 mL/kg).<span class="Sup">6</span> In cattle, elimination occurs primarily through biliary excretion.<span class="Sup">7</span> This may, at least in part, explain the presence of multiple peaks in the blood concentration/time profile following IV administration.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>In healthy cattle, total body clearance of flunixin has been reported to range from 90 to 151 mL/kg/hr.<span class="Sup">2-5</span> These studies also report a large discrepancy between the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) and the volume of distribution associated with the terminal elimination phase (Vß). This discrepancy appears to be attributable to extended drug elimination from a deep compartment.<span class="Sup">8</span> The terminal half-life following IV injection has been shown to vary from 3.14 to 8.12 hours.<span class="Sup">2-5</span> Although the average depletion half-life of flunixin following IV administration is less than that following intramuscular and subcutaneous Hexasol Injection, a range of terminal elimination half-life values similar to those reported above are observed following subcutaneous and intramuscular injection. The absolute bioavailability of the flunixin component of Hexasol Injection is 83% when administered via the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes of administration.</p><p>Flunixin persists in inflammatory tissues<span class="Sup">9</span> and is associated with anti-inflammatory properties which extend well beyond the period associated with detectable plasma drug concentrations.<span class="Sup">4-9</span> These observations account for the counterclockwise hysteresis associated with flunixin's pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships.<span class="Sup">10</span> Therefore, prediction of drug concentrations based upon the estimated plasma terminal elimination half-life will likely underestimate both the duration of drug action and the concentration of drug remaining at the site of activity.</p><h2>ANIMAL SAFETY:</h2><p class="First">A randomized negative-controlled target animal safety study was conducted in 3- to 5-month-old calves to evaluate the effects of Hexasol Injection when administered to cattle intramuscularly at 1X, 3X, and 5X the labeled dose every 3 days for 3 treatments (3X the labeled duration). Hexasol Injection produced no drug-related adverse effects at the labeled dose. In separate injection site studies, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Hexasol Injection resulted in transient inflammation, including signs of discomfort, swelling, and/or hardness.</p><h2>EFFECTIVENESS:</h2><p class="First">The effectiveness of Hexasol Injection for the control of pyrexia associated with bovine respiratory disease was demonstrated in a US multi-location study. Crossbred beef calves were enrolled if they had an abnormal respiratory score and/or an abnormal attitude score and a rectal temperature of ≥104.5 °F. Calves were randomly assigned and treated with either Hexasol Injection (13.6 mg oxytetracycline/lb BW and 0.9 mg flunixin/lb BW), Tetradure (oxytetracycline, NADA 141-143, 13.6 mg oxytetracycline/lb BW) or saline as a single subcutaneous (SC) injection in the neck at 1 mL/22 lb BW at enrollment (Hour 0). At 6 hours ±1 hour, there was a clinically relevant decrease in mean rectal temperature in the Hexasol Injection-treated group. The decrease in mean rectal temperature in the Hexasol Injection-treated group compared to the saline-treated group and in the Hexasol Injection-treated group compared to the Tetradure-treated group was statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001).</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED:</h2><p class="First">Hexasol Injection is available in 100 mL, 250 mL and 500 mL vials containing 300 mg oxytetracycline and 20 mg flunixin as flunixin meglumine per mL.</p><h2>STORAGE:</h2><p class="First">Store at 59° to 86°F (15° to 30°C)</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Restricted Drug (California) - Use Only As Directed.</span></p><p>NADA 141-312, Approved By FDA</p><p><span class="Bold">Made in the UK.</span></p><p>Norbrook Laboratories Limited<br/>
