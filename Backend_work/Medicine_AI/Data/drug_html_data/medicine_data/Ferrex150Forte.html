Hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis are contraindications to iron supplementation.</p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First">Folic Acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> is deficient.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Do not exceed recommended dose.</span></p><p>The type of anemia and the underlying cause or causes should be determined before starting Ferrex™ 150 Forte. Since the anemia may be a result of a systemic disturbance, such as recurrent blood loss, the underlying cause or causes should be corrected, if possible.</p><p>Folic Acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. Pernicious anemia should be excluded before using this product since folic acid may mask the symptoms of pernicious anemia.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies on this product have not been performed in subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions with iron supplementation may include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dark stools and abdominal pain. Adverse reactions with iron therapy are usually transient.</p><p>Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">The clinical course of acute iron overdosage can be variable. Initial symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tarry stools, melena, hematemesis, hypotension, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, dehydration, drowsiness, pallor, cyanosis, lassitude, seizures, shock and coma.</p><h2>How is Ferrex 150 Forte Supplied</h2><p class="First">Ferrex™ 150 Forte capsules are available as an opaque maroon capsule, imprinted B 198.
