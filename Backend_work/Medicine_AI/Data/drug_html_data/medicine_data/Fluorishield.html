</ul><p class="First">Your dentist has selected for you Fluorishield, a 1.1% Sodium Fluoride product that was specially developed to prevent tooth decay which can occur from xerostomia (dry mouth). Dry mouth can result from radiation therapy, systemic diseases, medications which affect the salivary glands and mouth breathing. Clinical trials have shown that application of topical fluoride gel in the presence of good oral hygiene can prevent or significantly reduce tooth decay which is related to dry mouth.  Fluorishield topical fluoride gel can be applied with a custom carrier or tray, directly brushed on, or used with an over denture. Your dentist will prescribe the method that is best suited for your individual needs. The gel is easily dispensed when the bottle is inverted for storing.</p><p><span class="Bold">STORE INVERTED FOR EASY REMOVAL OF CONTENTS.</span></p><h2>Description:</h2><p class="First">Topical neutral 1.1% sodium fluoride for use as a dental caries preventative in children and adults.
