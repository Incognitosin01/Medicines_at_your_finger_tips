Potential applications in diabetes and hepatic and cardiovascular disease have been suggested, but there is no evidence to support these uses.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>Clinical trials are lacking to provide dosing recommendations for African basil.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Contraindications have not been identified.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. O. gratissimum may have abortifacient effects.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>None documented.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>No data.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Lamiaceae (mint)</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>O. gratissimum is an aromatic, perennial plant native to Africa, Madagascar, and southern Asia. It grows up to 1 m in height, with multiple branches arising from its base. It has elliptic-lanceolate leaves that taper at both ends, and long, pale, white to pinkish flower spikes. Recognized synonyms for African basil include Ocimum suave and Ocimum viride Willd.Plants 2016, USDA 2016, Nweze 2009</p><p>Related plants include Ocimum basilicum (sweet basil), Ocimum canum (African mint), Ocimum campechianum (Amazonian basil), and Ocimum tenuiflorum or Ocimum sanctum (holy basil).</p><h2>History</h2><p>Dried leaves of the plant are used for flavoring food and have traditionally been used to alleviate headache and fever, among other uses.Nweze 2009 The plant has traditionally been used in some African countries to induce abortion,Nikolajsen 2011 facilitate childbirth, and reduce associated pain.Attah 2012 It has also been used in the management of diabetes.Ejike 2013</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Similar to other members of the Ocimum genus, O. gratissimum contains an essential oil, alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, and other chemical constituents. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been used to elucidate the constituents of the essential oil: eugenol and methyl eugenol, alpha and beta-caryophyllene, 1,8 cineole, methyl chavicol, carvacrol, linalool, thymol, limonene, gamma-terpinene, camphor, germacrene A, beta-ocimene, and cinnamyl acetate. Chemical composition varies with geographical location and environmental and genetic factors.Pandey 2014, Mahajan 2013</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Anti-inflammatory activity</h3><p>In models of respiratory allergy (in vitro experiments evaluating effects on airway epithelial cells, in vivo studies in rodents), O. gratissimum demonstrated effects on markers of inflammation, including interleukins, protein kinases, and leukocytes/eosinophils.Costa 2012, Jiao 2013</p><p>In mouse paw edema studies, ethanol and aqueous extracts of O. suave demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity.Masresha 2012 Limited studies in rodents suggest antinociceptive activity of O. gratissimum extracts and essential oil, which may be mediated through the opioid and endocannabinoid systems.Paula-Freire 2013, Paula-Freire 2014</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of O. gratissimum as an anti-inflammatory agent.</p><h3>Antimicrobial activity</h3><p>Antimicrobial activity against relevant human pathogens (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Vibrio spp., and periodontopathic organisms) has been demonstrated.Nweze 2009, Tibyangye 2015, Ocheng 2015, Adesina 2015, Igbinosa 2016 Antifungal activity of the essential oil has also been observed in vitro.Nweze 2009, Prakash 2011 O. gratissimum extracts have been used in topical preparations as a mosquito repellant.Keziah 2015</p><p>A small clinical study evaluated the effect of an O. gratissimum mouthwash in reducing gingivitis. Plaque and bleeding were reduced in both the test and control groups, with O. gratissimum demonstrating equivalence to the chlorhexidine used in control subjects.Pereira 2011</p><h3>Cardiovascular effects</h3><p>In a study in rats, O. gratissimum essential oil demonstrated endothelium-dependent, vasorelaxant effects and decreased perfusion pressure in isolated mesenteric vascular beds.Pires 2012</p><p>An extract of O. gratissimum attenuated induced cardiac abnormalities associated with liver fibrosis in rats, possibly by influencing the interleukin-6 signaling pathwayLi 2012 or by inducing antioxidant effects.Chiu 2014</p><p>In Wistar rats, O. gratissimum extracts reversed toxicity and blood pressure changes associated with cobalt-chloride exposure, indicating a protective effect.Akinrinde 2016</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding the use of O. gratissimum as a cardiovascular agent.</p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p>Limited reports in rodents suggest glucose-lowering effects of O. gratissimum extracts, which indicates a propensity of O. gratissimum to reverse impairment of nutrient digestion and absorption in diabetes mellitus.Okon 2015, Shittu 2016 In vivo and in vitro studies evaluating the constituent eugenol showed reductions in blood glucose levels, possibly due to the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase (insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels remained unchanged).Singh 2016</p><p>A small study (N = 27) evaluated the effect of O. gratissimum decoctions, given singly or as a combination decoction, on oral glucose tolerance. Neither the peak time of the oral glucose tolerance test nor the area under the curve changed relative to baseline with O. gratissimum alone.Ejike 2013</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>In rats with induced gastric ulcers, the aqueous leaves extract of O. gratissimum decreased gastric acid secretion and ulceration.Ofem 2012</p><p>Activity against certain cancer cell linesNangia-Makker 2013, Pandey 2015 and antisickling activity of ursolic acid isolated from O. gratissimum have been demonstrated.Tshilanda 2015</p><p>O. gratissimum essential oil exhibited larvicidal activity against the Aedes albopictus mosquito, an important and proven viral disease vector.Sumitha 2016</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Clinical trials are lacking to provide dosing recommendations for African basil.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking. Women in Africa reportedly use O. gratissimum to induce abortion,Nikolajsen 2011 facilitate childbirth, and reduce associated pain.Attah 2012</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>None documented.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Equivocal findings regarding toxic effects of orally administered O. gratissimum on hematological parameters (eg, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet and neutrophil counts) have been reported in animal studies; the effects on human blood are unknown.Ofem 2012, Obianime 2011</p><p>The essential oil was reportedly nontoxic in mice, with a high acute median lethal dose of 11,622.67 mcL/kg.Prakash 2011</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Ocimum basilicum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum campechianum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum canum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum sanctum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum suave</i></li><li><i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i></li><li><i>Ocimum viride</i> Willd.</li><li>African mint</li><li>Amazonian basil</li><li>Holy basil</li><li>Sweet basil</li></ul><h2>References</h2><h2>Disclaimer</h2><p>This information relates to an herbal, vitamin, mineral or other dietary supplement.
