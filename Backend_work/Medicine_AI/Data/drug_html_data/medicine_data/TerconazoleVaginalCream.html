It is insoluble in water; sparingly soluble in ethanol; and soluble in butanol.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg <span class="Sup">14</span>C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5 mcg/mL.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (&gt;95%).</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean<span class="Bold"> </span>elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours.<span class="Bold"> </span>Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg<span class="Bold"> </span><span class="Sup">14</span>C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to<span class="Bold"> </span>10% (mean ±SD: 5.7 ± 3%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the<span class="Bold"> </span>urine and 2 to 6% (mean ± SD: 4.2 ± 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the<span class="Bold"> </span>7-day collection period.</p><p><span class="Bold">Multiple Dosing</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><br/></span> There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall<span class="Bold"> </span>exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories<span class="Bold"> </span>for 3 days.</p><p>Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with Terconazole Vaginal Cream (0.4%).</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Microbiology</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Mechanism of action</span><br/>
Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Activity <span class="Italics">in vitro<br/></span></span> Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> against <span class="Italics">Candida albicans </span>and other<span class="Italics"><span class="Bold"> </span>Candida</span> species. The MIC values of terconazole against most <span class="Italics">Lactobacillus</span> spp.<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span>typically found in the human vagina were ≥ 128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial<span class="Bold"><span class="Italics"> </span></span>bacteria are not affected by drug treatment.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">Terconazole Vaginal Cream 0.4% is indicated for the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (moniliasis). As Terconazole Vaginal Cream 0.4% is effective only for vulvovaginitis caused by the genus <span class="Italics">Candida</span>, the diagnosis should be confirmed by KOH smears and/or cultures.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Patients known to be hypersensitive to terconazole or to any of the components of the cream.</p><h2>WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Anaphylaxis and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported during terconazole therapy. Terconazole therapy should be discontinued if anaphylaxis or toxic epidermal necrolysis develops.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span></p><p>For vaginal use only. Terconazole Vaginal Cream 0.4% is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Laboratory Tests</span></p><p>If there is a lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis</span></p><p>Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mutagenicity</span></p><p>Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C:</span></span></p><p>There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (100x the intravaginal human dose of the 0.4% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats.</p><p>Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20 to 40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increase incidence of skeletal variants.</p><p>The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 44 times the mean peak plasma level (0.004 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of Terconazole Vaginal Cream 0.4%. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes.</p><p>Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient.</p><p>Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers</span></p><p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use</span></p><p>Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></p><p>Clinical studies of Terconazole Vaginal Cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><br/></span> Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction<span class="Bold"> </span>rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the<span class="Bold"> </span>clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, 521 patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream. Based on comparative analyses with placebo, the adverse experiences considered most likely related to terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream were headache (26% vs. 17% with placebo) and body pain (2.1% vs. 0% with placebo). Fever (1.7% vs. 0.5% with placebo) and chills (0.4% vs. 0.0% with placebo), vulvovaginal burning, itching and irritation have also been reported. The adverse drug experience on terconazole most frequently causing discontinuation was vulvovaginal itching.</p><p><span class="Bold">Post-marketing Experience</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><br/></span> The following adverse drug reactions have been first identified during post-marketing<span class="Bold"> </span>experience with Terconazole Vaginal Cream 0.4%.
