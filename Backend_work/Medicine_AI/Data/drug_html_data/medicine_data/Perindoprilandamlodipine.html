High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.</p><p>Perindopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure.</p><p>Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p><p>Perindopril and amlodipine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using perindopril and amlodipine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of perindopril and amlodipine combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of perindopril and amlodipine combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, dizziness, rash) or age-related liver problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving perindopril and amlodipine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding.
