</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for RUBY-FILL</h2><p class="First">RUBY-FILL is a closed system used to produce rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection for intravenous administration. Rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the myocardium under rest or pharmacologic stress conditions to evaluate regional myocardial perfusion in adult patients with suspected or existing coronary artery disease.</p><h2>RUBY-FILL Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Radiation Safety - Drug Handling</h3><p class="First">Rubidium Rb 82 is a radioactive drug and should be handled with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure during administration <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3]</span>).</p><ul>
<li><span class="Bold">Use only additive-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP to elute the generator</span> [<span class="Italics">see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</li>
<li>Use waterproof gloves and effective shielding when handling rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection and the RUBY Rubidium Elution System.</li>
<li>Use aseptic techniques in all drug handling.</li>
<li>Visually inspect the drug for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer eluate from the generator if there is any evidence of foreign matter.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended Dose and Administration Instructions</h3><ul>
<li>The recommended weight-based dose of rubidium Rb 82 chloride to be administered per rest or stress component of a PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) procedure is between 10 to 30 Megabecquerels (MBq)/kg [0.27 to 0.81 millicuries (mCi)/kg].</li>
<li>Do not exceed a single dose of 2220 MBq (60 mCi).</li>
<li>Use the lowest dose necessary to obtain adequate cardiac visualization and individualize the weight-based dose depending on multiple factors, including, patient weight, imaging equipment and acquisition type used to perform the procedure. For example, 3D imaging acquisition may require doses at the lower end of the recommended range compared to 2D imaging.</li>
<li>Administer the single dose at a rate of 15 to 30 mL/minute through a catheter inserted into a large peripheral vein; do not exceed an infusion volume of 60 mL.</li>
<li>Instruct patients to void as soon as a study is completed and as often as possible thereafter for at least one hour.</li>
<li>The maximum available activity (delivery limit) will decrease as the generator ages <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h3>Image Acquisition Guidelines</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For Rest Imaging:</span></p><ul>
<li>Administer a single (“rest”) rubidium Rb 82 chloride dose;</li>
<li>Start imaging 60 to 90 seconds after completion of the infusion of the rest dose and acquire images for 3 to 7 minutes.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">For Stress Imaging:</span></p><ul>
<li>Begin the study 10 minutes after completion of the resting dose infusion, to allow for sufficient Rb 82 decay;</li>
<li>Administer a pharmacologic stress agent in accordance with its prescribing information;</li>
<li>After administration of the pharmacologic stress agent, administer the second dose of Rb 82 at the time interval according to the prescribing information of the pharmacological stress agent;</li>
<li>Start imaging 60 to 90 seconds after completion of the stress rubidium Rb 82 chloride dose infusion and acquire images for 3 to 7 minutes.</li>
</ul><p><span class="Bold">For Both Rest and Stress Imaging:</span></p><ul>
<li>If a longer circulation time is anticipated (e.g., in a patient with severe left ventricular dysfunction), start imaging 120 seconds after the rest dose.</li>
<li>Acquisition may be started immediately post-injection if dynamic imaging is needed.</li>
</ul><h3>Elution System</h3><ul>
<li>Use RUBY-FILL Rubidium Rb 82 Generator only with an elution system specifically designed for use with the generator (RUBY Rubidium Elution System) and capable of accurate measurement and delivery of doses of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection.</li>
<li>The generator used with the elution system provides ± 10% accuracy for rubidium Rb 82 chloride doses between 370 to 2220 MBq (10 to 60 mCi)</li>
<li>Follow instructions in the RUBY Rubidium Elution System User Manual for the set up and intravenous infusion of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection dose.</li>
</ul><h3>Directions for Eluting Rubidium Rb 82 Chloride Injection</h3><ul>

RUBY-FILL consists of Sr 82 adsorbed on a hydrous stannic oxide column with an activity of 3145 to 4255 MBq (85 to 115 mCi) Sr 82 at calibration time.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">RUBY-FILL is contraindicated for use if a solution other than additive-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP has been used to elute the generator at any time. Immediately stop the patient infusion and permanently discontinue the use of the affected RUBY-FILL generator whenever the incorrect eluent is used [<span class="Italics">see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</span>].</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>High Level Radiation Exposure with Use of Incorrect Eluent</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Use only additive-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP to elute the generator. </span> Apply the provided saline confirmation label to the additive-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP bag before use. Additives present in other solutions (particularly calcium ions) expose patients to high levels of radiation by causing the release of large amounts of Sr 82 and Sr 85 into the eluate regardless of the generator’s age or prior use <span class="Italics">[Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5, 2.6)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immediately stop the patient infusion and discontinue use of the affected RUBY-FILL generator</span> if the incorrect eluent is used and <span class="Bold">evaluate the patient’s radiation absorbed dose and monitor for the effects of radiation to critical organs such as bone marrow.</span> When solutions containing calcium ions are used to elute the generator, high levels of radioactivity are present in the eluate, even with the subsequent use of additive-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.9), and Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>Excess Radiation Exposure with Failure to Follow the Quality Control Testing Procedure</h3><p class="First">Excess radiation exposure occurs when the Sr 82 and Sr 85 levels in rubidium Rb 82 chloride injections exceed the specified generator eluate limits. Strictly adhere to the quality control testing procedure to minimize radiation exposure to the patient. Stop using the rubidium generator when the expiration limits are reached <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and (2.7)].</span></p><h3>Risks Associated with Pharmacologic Stress</h3><p class="First">Pharmacologic induction of cardiovascular stress may be associated with serious adverse reactions such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, and cerebrovascular events. Perform pharmacologic stress testing in accordance with the pharmacologic stress agent’s prescribing information and only in the setting where cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff are readily available.</p><h3>Radiation Risks</h3><p class="First">RUBY-FILL use contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and health care providers. Encourage patients to void as soon as a study is completed and as often as possible thereafter for at least one hour <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and (2.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reaction associated with the use of rubidium Rb 82 chloride was identified in clinical trials or post marketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Radiation Exposure</span><br/>
High level radiation exposure to the bone marrow has occurred in some patients due to Sr 82 and Sr 85 breakthrough in the eluate when an incorrect solution was used to elute the rubidium Rb 82 generator <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. Excess radiation exposure has occurred in some patients who received rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection at clinical sites where generator eluate testing appeared insufficient <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
There are no data available on the use of rubidium Rb 82 in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies with rubidium Rb 82 chloride have not been conducted. However, all radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose. If considering rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection administration to a pregnant woman, inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from Rb 82 and the gestational timing of exposure.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
There is no information regarding the presence of Rb 82 chloride in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Due to the short half-life of Rb 82 chloride (75 seconds), exposure of a breast fed infant through breast milk can be minimized by temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding <span class="Italics">[See Clinical Considerations]</span>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Rb 82, any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Rb 82 or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Minimizing Exposure</span><br/>
Exposure to Rb 82 chloride through breast milk can be minimized if breastfeeding is discontinued when Rb 82 chloride injection is administered. Do not resume breastfeeding until at least one hour after completion of RUBY-FILL infusion.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In elderly patients with a clinically important decrease in cardiac function, lengthen the delay between infusion and image acquisition <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>. Observe for the possibility of fluid overload from the infusion.</p><h2>RUBY-FILL Description</h2><h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3><p class="First">RUBY-FILL Rubidium Rb 82 Generator contains accelerator-produced Sr 82 adsorbed on stannic oxide in a lead-shielded column and provides a means for obtaining sterile non-pyrogenic solutions of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection. The chemical form of Rb 82 is <span class="Sup">82</span>RbCl.</p><p>The amount (mCi) of Rb 82 obtained in each elution will depend on the potency of the generator. When used with the RUBY Rubidium Elution System, the generator provides ± 10% accuracy for rubidium Rb 82 chloride doses between 370 to 2220 MBq (10 to 60 mCi).</p><p>When eluted at a rate of 15 to 30 mL/minute, each generator eluate at the end of elution should not contain more than 0.02 mcCi (0.74 kBq) of Sr 82 and not more than 0.2 mcCi (7.4 kBq) of Sr 85 per mCi of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection, and not more than 1 mcg of tin per mL of eluate.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><p class="First">Rb 82 decays by positron emission and associated gamma emission with a physical half-life of 75 seconds. Table 5 shows the annihilation photons released following positron emission which are useful for detection and imaging studies.</p><p>The decay modes of Rb 82 are: 95.5% by positron emission, resulting in the production of annihilation radiation, i.e., two 511 keV gamma rays; and 4.5% by electron capture, resulting in the emission of “prompt” gamma rays of predominantly 776.5 keV. Both decay modes lead directly to the formation of stable Kr 82.</p><p class="First">The specific gamma ray constant for Rb 82 is 6.33 R cm<span class="Sup">2</span> / mCi h (1.23 × 10<span class="Sup">-12</span> C m<span class="Sup">2</span> / kg MBq s). The first half-value layer is 0.53 cm of lead (Pb). Table 6 shows a range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb. For example, the use of a 6.15 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1,000.</p><p>Sr 82 (half-life of 25 days; 600 hrs.) decays to Rb 82. To correct for physical decay of Sr 82, Table 7 shows the fractions that remain at selected intervals after the time of calibration.</p><p>* Calibration time</p><p>To correct for physical decay of Rb 82, Table 1 shows the fraction of Rb 82 remaining in all 15 second intervals up to 300 seconds after time of calibration <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</span></p><h2>RUBY-FILL - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Rb 82 is analogous to potassium ion (K<span class="Sup">+</span>) in its biochemical behavior and is rapidly extracted by the myocardium proportional to the blood flow. Rb<span class="Sup">+</span> participates in the sodium-potassium (Na<span class="Sup">+</span>/K<span class="Sup">+</span>) ion exchange pumps that are present in cell membranes. The intracellular uptake of Rb 82 requires maintenance of ionic gradient across cell membranes. Rb 82 radioactivity in viable myocardium is higher than in infarcted tissue, reflecting intracellular retention.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In human studies, myocardial activity was noted within the first minute after peripheral intravenous injection of Rb 82. When areas of infarction or ischemia are present in the myocardium, they are visualized within 2 to 7 minutes after injection as photon-deficient, or “cold”, areas on the myocardial perfusion scan. In patients with reduced cardiac function, transit of the injected dose from the peripheral infusion site to the myocardium may be delayed.</p><p>Blood flow brings Rb 82 to all areas of the body during the first pass of circulation. Accordingly, visible uptake is observed in highly vascularized organs, such as the kidneys, liver, spleen and lungs.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">With a physical half-life of 75 seconds, Rb 82 is converted by radioactive decay into stable Kr 82 gas, which is passively expired by the lungs.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No long-term studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity potential, or to determine whether rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection may affect fertility in males or females.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In a descriptive, prospective, blinded image interpretation study of adult patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, myocardial perfusion deficits in stress and rest PET images obtained with ammonia N 13 (n = 111) or Rb 82 (n = 82) were compared to changes in stenosis flow reserve (SFR) as determined by coronary angiography. PET perfusion defects at rest and stress for seven cardiac regions (anterior, apical, anteroseptal, posteroseptal, anterolateral, posterolateral, and inferior walls) were graded on a scale of 0 (normal) to 5 (severe). Values for stenosis flow reserve, defined as flow at maximum coronary vasodilatation relative to rest flow, ranged from 0 (total occlusion) to 5 (normal). With increasing impairment of flow reserve, the subjective PET defect severity increased. A PET defect score of 2 or higher was positively correlated with flow reserve impairment (SFR &lt; 3).</p><p>A systematic review of published literature was conducted using pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria which resulted in identification of 10 studies evaluating the use of Rb 82 PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for the identification of coronary artery disease as defined by catheter-based angiography. In these studies, the patient was the unit of analysis and 50% stenosis was the threshold for clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Of these 10 studies, 9 studies were included in a meta-analysis for sensitivity (excluding one study with 100% sensitivity) and 7 studies were included in a meta-analysis of specificity (excluding 3 studies with 100% specificity). A random effects model yielded overall estimates of sensitivity and specificity of 92% (95% CI: 89% to 95%) and 81% (95% CI: 76% to 86%), respectively. The use of meta-analysis in establishing performance characteristics is limited, particularly by the possibility of publication bias (positive results being more likely to be published than negative results) which is difficult to detect especially when based on a limited number of small studies.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><h3>How Supplied</h3><p class="First">RUBY-FILL Rubidium Rb 82 Generator consists of Sr 82 adsorbed on a hydrous stannic oxide column with an activity of 3145 to 4255 MBq (85 to 115 mCi) Sr 82 at calibration time.
