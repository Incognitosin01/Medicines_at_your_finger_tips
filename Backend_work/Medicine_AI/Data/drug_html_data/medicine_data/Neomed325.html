Provide medicated water as the sole source of water each day until consumed, followed by non-medicated water as required.  Fresh medicated water should be prepared each day.  For a stock solution, add six level tablespoonfuls to one gallon of water.  Each pint of this stock solution will medicate 5 gallons of drinking water.</p><p>For use in automatic proportioners delivering 2 ounces of stock solution per gallon of drinking water, dissolve 9 level tablespoonfuls in a gallon of water to make the stock solution.</p><p>Individual Animal Treatment:  To provide 10 mg neomycin sulfate per pound of body weight, mix one (1) level teaspoon** in water or milk for each 160 pounds of body weight.  Administer daily either as a drench in divided doses or in the drinking water to be consumed in 12-24 hours.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span>  To administer the stated dosage, the concentration of neomycin required in medicated water must be adjusted to compensate for variation in age and weight of animal, the nature and severity of disease signs, and environmental temperature and humidity, each of which affects water consumption.</p><p>If symptoms persist after using this preparation for 2 or 3 days, consult a veterinarian.  If symptoms such as fever,depression, or going off feed develop, oral neomycin is not indicated as the sole treatment since systemic levels of neomycin are not obtained due to low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>IMPORTANT:  Treatment should continue 24 to 48 hours beyond remission of disease symptoms, but not to exceed a total of 14 consecutive days for cattle, swine, sheep and goats and 5 days for turkeys.  Animals not drinking or eating should be treated individually by drench.<br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">RESIDUE WARNINGS:</span>  Discontinue treatment prior to slaughter by at least the number of days listed below for appropriate species:</p><p>Cattle.....1 day</p><p>Swine and goats.....3 days</p><p>Sheep.....2 days</p><p>Turkeys.....0 days</p><p>A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves.  Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.  A milk discard period has not been established for this product in lactating dairy cattle. <br/></p><p>Do not use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older. <br/></p><p>Use of more than one product containing neomycin or failure to follow withdrawal times may result in illegal drug residues.</p><p>**  Level teaspoonful =  US Standard Measure<br/></p><h2>Package Label Display Panel</h2><p class="First">Neomed 325</p><p>Soluble Powder</p><p>Neomycin Sulfate (commercial grade)</p><p>Antibacterial</p><p>For the treatment and control of colibacillosis (bacterial enteritis) caused by Escherichia coli susceptible to neomycin sulfate in cattle (excluding veal calves), swine, sheep and goats.</p><p>For the control of mortality associated with Escherichia coli organisms susceptible to neomycin sulfate in growing turkeys.</p><p>Each Pound Contains:  325 g neomycin sulfate (commercial grade) equivalent to 227.5 g neomycin.</p><p>FOR ANIMAL USE ONLY</p><p>KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN</p><p>Restricted Drug  - Use Only as Directed (California)</p><p>ANADA 200-050, Approved by FDA</p><p>NET WEIGHT:</p><p>50 Pounds (22.7 kg)</p><p></p><p class="ddc-disclaimer-link">Medical Disclaimer</p></body></html>
