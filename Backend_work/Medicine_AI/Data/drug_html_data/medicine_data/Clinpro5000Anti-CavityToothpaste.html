</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste</h2><p class="First">Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste is indicated for use as part of a professional program for the prevention and control of dental caries.</p><h2>Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">• Use once daily in place of conventional toothpaste unless instructed otherwise by a physician or dentist.</p><p>• Apply a thin ribbon or pea-sized amount of Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste using a soft-bristled toothbrush and brush teeth for at least two minutes.</p><p>• After brushing adults should expectorate. Children 6 to 16 years of age should expectorate and rinse mouth thoroughly with water.</p><p>• Follow these instructions or use as directed by a dental professional.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">White toothpaste containing 1.1% sodium fluoride</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Do not use in children under 6 years of age unless recommended by a dentist or physician.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">• DO NOT SWALLOW. If more than a pea-sized amount of Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste is swallowed, contact a medical or dental professional or a poison control center.</p><p>• Keep out of reach of children under 6 years of age.</p><p>• Repeated ingestion of high levels of fluoride may cause dental fluorosis. For this reason, use in children with developing dentition requires special supervision to prevent swallowing. Prescribing dentists and physicians should consider risk of fluorosis when prescribing for use in children less than 6 years of age.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Allergic reactions and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Fluoride crosses the placenta in women and has been measured in cord blood, amniotic fluid, and serum of newborn children, but without a consistent correlation to maternal serum fluoride levels.<span class="Sup">1,2</span> There are no data to indicate an increased susceptibility to fluorosis during pregnancy. Developmental studies were conducted by the National Toxicology Program, with sodium fluoride administered in the drinking water to pregnant rats and rabbits. No developmental toxicity was observed, even at doses that caused maternal toxicity. The No Adverse Effect Levels were about 29 mg/kg-day and 27 mg/kg-day for rabbits and rats, respectively.<span class="Sup">3</span> There is no conclusive evidence of fluoride developmental effects in humans.<span class="Sup">1,2</span></p><p>The Institute of Medicine established a fluoride Upper Limit of 10 mg/day for pregnant women.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>Prescribing physicians and dentists should consider total fluoride exposure (dental care plus food, water and other sources) when prescribing the product for use in pregnant women or women who may become pregnant.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">An extremely small proportion of fluoride in drinking water is transferred to breast milk. The Institute of Medicine established a fluoride Upper Limit of 10 mg/day for nursing women.<span class="Sup">2</span> Prescribing physicians and dentists should consider total fluoride exposure (dental care plus food, water and other sources) when prescribing the product for use in women who are nursing.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The primary adverse effects of fluoride are fluorosis of dental enamel and of the skeleton; these effects occur at exposures below those associated with other adverse health effects. The population most at risk for dental fluorosis is children during the period of tooth formation, i.e. from birth to 8 years of age. For this population, the Institute of Medicine established Fluoride Upper Limits of intake based on the risk of dental fluorosis. In populations with permanent dentition, skeletal fluorosis is the greatest risk from excessive fluoride. For this population the Institute of Medicine (IOM) established Fluoride Upper Limits based on the risk of skeletal fluorosis.<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p>Prescribing physicians and dentists should consider total fluoride exposure (dental care plus food, water and other sources) when prescribing the product for use in children.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">No studies of Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste have been conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Ingestion of large amounts of fluoride may result in abdominal pain, stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms may occur at overdosages of 5 mg/kg of body weight. Fluoride doses of 16 mg/kg have been fatal.</p><h2>Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste Description</h2><p class="First">Clinpro 5000 1.1% Sodium Fluoride Anti-Cavity Toothpaste is a self-applied fluoride dentifrice for the prevention of dental caries. Each gram contains 5 mg of fluoride ion in a neutral pH base, consisting of water, sorbitol, hydrated silica, glycerin, polyethylene-polypropylene glycol, flavor, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium saccharin and tri-calcium phosphate.</p><h2>Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Clinpro 5000 1.1% Sodium Fluoride Anti-Cavity Toothpaste aids in the prevention of tooth decay. Fluoride delivered from Clinpro 5000 inhibits the demineralization of sound teeth and enhances the remineralization (i.e., repair) of demineralized teeth. During tooth brushing, fluoride is taken up by teeth and dental plaque. Fluoride is taken up with calcium and phosphate by demineralized teeth resulting in an improved tooth structure than contains more fluoride and less carbonate than naturally occurring tooth structure and is more resistant to acid challenge. Additionally, calcium fluoride is formed on the crystal structure of teeth. As the pH of the mouth drops, fluoride is released from calcium fluoride and aids in the remineralization of teeth. Fluoride taken up into plaque alters the activity of cariogenic bacteria. Fluoride inhibits the process by which cariogenic bacteria metabolize carbohydrates resulting in less acid and adhesive polysaccharide production by the bacteria.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Clinpro 5000 Anti-Cavity Toothpaste is supplied as a white dentifrice paste in a 4 oz.
