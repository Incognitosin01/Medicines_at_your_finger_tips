</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting.

</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Lactic Acidosis</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Lactic Acidosis</span></p><p>There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.</p><p>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets. In alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</p><p>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</p><p>For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Renal Impairment</span></p><p>The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:</span></p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Before initiating alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets, obtain an eGFR.</li>
<li>Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span><span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</li>
<li>Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span> because these patients require a lower dosage of alogliptin than what is available in the fixed combination alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets product.</li>
<li>Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions</span></p><p>The concomitant use of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7)].</span> Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Age 65 or Greater</span></p><p>The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Radiological Studies with Contrast</span></p><p>Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets if renal function is stable.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Surgery and Other Procedures</span></p><p>Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypoxic States</span></p><p>Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Excessive Alcohol Intake</span></p><p>Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hepatic Impairment</span></p><p>Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.</p><h3>Pancreatitis</h3><p class="First">Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, acute pancreatitis was reported in 6 (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 2 (&lt;0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in 10 (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in 7 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo.</p><p>It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets<span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>After initiation of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, alogliptin should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.</p><h3>Heart Failure</h3><p class="First">In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome, 106 (3.9%) of patients treated with alogliptin and 89 (3.3%) of patients treated with placebo were hospitalized for congestive heart failure.</p><p>Consider the risks and benefits of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Patients should be advised of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and should be instructed to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets, assess for other potential causes for the event and institute alternative treatment for diabetes <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]</span>. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema with another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.</p><h3>Hepatic Effects</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking alogliptin, although some of the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].</span></p><p>In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo.</p><p>Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have clinically significant liver enzyme elevations and if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.</p><h3>Vitamin B12 Levels</h3><p class="First">In controlled, 29-week clinical trials of immediate-release metformin, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B<span class="Sub">12</span> absorption from the B<span class="Sub">12</span>-intrinsic factor complex is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets, and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B<span class="Sub">12</span> measurements at two to three year intervals may be useful.</p><h3>Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin</span></p><p>Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p><p>Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and in people who are taking β-adrenergic blocking drugs.</p><h3>Severe and Disabling Arthralgia</h3><p class="First">There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP- 4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.</p><h3>Bullous Pemphigoid</h3><p class="First">Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.</p><h3>Macrovascular Outcomes</h3><p class="First">There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets or any other antidiabetic drug.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Pancreatitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Heart Failure <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>

</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p><p>Over 2700 patients with type 2 diabetes have received alogliptin coadministered with metformin in four large, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trials. The mean exposure to alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets was 58 weeks, with more than 1400 subjects treated for more than one year. These included two 26 week placebo-controlled studies, one 52 week active control study and an interim analysis of a 104 week active-controlled study. In the alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets arm, the mean duration of diabetes was approximately six years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (56% of patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and the mean age was 55 years (18% of patients ≥65 years of age).</p><p>In a pooled analysis of these four controlled clinical studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 74% in patients treated with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets compared to 75% treated with placebo. Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 6.2% with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets compared to 1.9% in placebo, 6.4% in metformin and 5.0% in alogliptin.</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in ≥4% of patients treated with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets and more frequently than in patients who received alogliptin, metformin or placebo are summarized in Table 1.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Hypoglycemia</span></p><p>In a 26 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of alogliptin in combination with metformin, the number of patients reporting hypoglycemia was 1.9% in the alogliptin 12.5 mg with metformin HCl 500 mg, 5.3% in the alogliptin 12.5 mg with metformin HCl 1000 mg, 1.8% in the metformin HCl 500 mg and 6.3% in the metformin HCl 1000 mg treatment groups.</p><p>In a 26 week placebo-controlled study of alogliptin 25 mg administered once daily as add-on to metformin regimen, the number of patients reporting hypoglycemic events was 0% in the alogliptin with metformin and 2.9% in the placebo treatment groups.</p><p>In a 52 week, active-controlled, double-blind study of alogliptin once daily as add-on therapy to the combination of pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin compared to the titration of pioglitazone 30 mg to 45 mg and metformin, the number of patients reporting hypoglycemia was 4.5% in the alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin group versus 1.5% in the pioglitazone 45 mg with metformin group.</p><p>In an interim analysis conducted in a 104 week, double-blind, active-controlled study of alogliptin 25 mg in combination with metformin, the number of patients reporting hypoglycemia was 1.4% in the alogliptin 25 mg with metformin group versus 23.8% in the glipizide with metformin group.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin</span></p><p>A total of 14,778 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in 14 randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials of whom 9052 subjects were treated with alogliptin, 3469 subjects were treated with placebo and 2257 were treated with an active comparator. The mean duration of diabetes was seven years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (49% of patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), and the mean age was 58 years (26% of patients ≥65 years of age).

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin</span></p><p>Acute pancreatitis, hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hepatic enzyme elevations, fulminant hepatic failure, severe and disabling arthralgia and bullous pemphigoid, rhabdomyolysis, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and ileus <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.8, 5.9)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metformin</span></p><p>Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin</span></p><p>Alogliptin is primarily renally excreted. Cytochrome (CYP) P450-related metabolism is negligible. No significant drug-drug interactions were observed with the CYP-substrates or inhibitors tested or with renally excreted drugs <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p><h3>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</h3><p class="First">Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently causes a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce nonanion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets may increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients.</p><h3>Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance</h3><p class="First">Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2]/multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use.</p><h3>Alcohol</h3><p class="First">Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets.</p><h3>Insulin Secretagogues and Insulin</h3><p class="First">When used in an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or with insulin, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.</p><h3>The Use of Metformin with Other Drugs</h3><p class="First">Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control.

These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin selectively binds to and inhibits DPP-4 but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p><p>Metformin is a biguanide that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes or in healthy subjects except in special circumstances <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span> and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and daylong plasma insulin response may actually decrease.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin</span></p><p>Single-dose administration of alogliptin to healthy subjects resulted in a peak inhibition of DPP-4 within two to three hours after dosing. The peak inhibition of DPP-4 exceeded 93% across doses of 12.5 mg to 800 mg. Inhibition of DPP-4 remained above 80% at 24 hours for doses greater than or equal to 25 mg. Peak and total exposure over 24 hours to active GLP-1 were three- to four-fold greater with alogliptin (at doses of 25 to 200 mg) than placebo. In a 16 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, alogliptin 25 mg demonstrated decreases in postprandial glucagon while increasing postprandial active GLP-1 levels compared to placebo over an eight hour period following a standardized meal. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in overall glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, alogliptin 25 mg demonstrated decreases in two hour postprandial glucose compared to placebo (-30 mg/dL versus 17 mg/dL, respectively).</p><p>Multiple-dose administration of alogliptin to patients with type 2 diabetes also resulted in a peak inhibition of DPP-4 within one to two hours and exceeded 93% across all doses (25 mg, 100 mg and 400 mg) after a single dose and after 14 days of once daily dosing. At these doses of alogliptin, inhibition of DPP-4 remained above 81% at 24 hours after 14 days of dosing.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption and Bioavailability</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Alogliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride</span></p><p>In bioequivalence studies of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets, the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of both the alogliptin and the metformin component following a single dose of the combination tablet were bioequivalent to the alogliptin 12.5 mg concomitantly administered with metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg tablets under fasted conditions in healthy subjects. Administration of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets with food resulted in no change in total exposure (AUC) of alogliptin and metformin. Mean peak plasma concentrations of alogliptin and metformin were decreased by 13% and 28%, respectively, when administered with food. There was no change in time to peak plasma concentrations (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) for alogliptin under fed conditions, however, there was a delayed T<span class="Sub">max</span> for metformin of 1.5 hours.

Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1500 mg and 850 mg to 2550 mg indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35 minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T<span class="Sub">max</span>) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin HCl with food compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting.

The racial distribution of patients exposed to study medication was 69.2% white, 16.3% Asian, 6.5% black and 8.0% other racial groups. The ethnic distribution was 24.3% Hispanic. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 54.4 years (range 22 to 80 years). In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets produced clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in A1C versus comparator. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) with alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Alogliptin and Metformin Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise</span></p><p>In a 26 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 784 patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise alone (mean baseline A1C = 8.4%) were randomized to one of seven treatment groups: placebo; metformin HCl 500 mg or metformin HCl 1000 mg twice daily, alogliptin 12.5 mg twice daily, or alogliptin 25 mg daily; alogliptin 12.5 mg in combination with metformin HCl 500 mg or metformin HCl 1000 mg twice daily. Both coadministration treatment arms (alogliptin 12.5 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg and alogliptin 12.5 mg + metformin HCl 1000 mg) resulted in significant improvements in A1C <span class="Italics">(Figure 3)</span> and FPG when compared with their respective individual alogliptin and metformin component regimens <span class="Italics">(Table 6)</span>.

Patients were maintained on a stable dose of metformin HCl (median daily dose = 1700 mg) during the treatment period. Alogliptin 25 mg in combination with metformin resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in A1C and FPG at Week 26, when compared to placebo <span class="Italics">(Table 7)</span>.

Patients were maintained on a stable dose of metformin HCl (median daily dose = 1700 mg). Patients who failed to meet prespecified hyperglycemic goals during the 52 week treatment period received glycemic rescue therapy.</p><p>In combination with pioglitazone and metformin, alogliptin 25 mg was shown to be statistically superior in lowering A1C and FPG compared with the titration of pioglitazone from 30 to 45 mg at Week 26 and at Week 52 <span class="Italics">(Table 8)</span>. A total of 11% of patients in the alogliptin 25 mg in combination with pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin treatment group and 22% of patients in the up titration of pioglitazone in combination with metformin treatment group required glycemic rescue.

Lipid effects were neutral.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cardiovascular Safety Trial</span></p><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial (EXAMINE) was conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular risk of alogliptin. The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between alogliptin (N=2701) and placebo (N=2679) when added to standard of care therapies for diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASCVD). The trial was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued.</p><p>Eligible patients were adults with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control at baseline (e.g., HbA1c &gt;6.5%) and had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome event (e.g., acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) 15 to 90 days prior to randomization. The dose of alogliptin was based on estimated renal function at baseline per dosage and administration recommendations. The average time between an acute coronary syndrome event and randomization was approximately 48 days.</p><p>The mean age of the population was 61 years. Most patients were male (68%), Caucasian (73%), and were recruited from outside of the United States (86%). Asian and Black patients contributed 20% and 4% of the total population, respectively. At the time of randomization patients had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for approximately 9 years, 87% had a prior myocardial infarction and 14% were current smokers. Hypertension (83%) and renal impairment (27% with an eGFR ≤60 ml/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) were prevalent co-morbid conditions. Use of medications to treat diabetes (e.g., metformin 73%, sulfonylurea 54%, insulin 41%), and ASCVD (e.g., statin 94%, aspirin 93%, renin-angiotensin system blocker 88%, beta-blocker 87%) was similar between patients randomized to alogliptin and placebo at baseline. During the trial, medications to treat diabetes and ASCVD could be adjusted to ensure care for these conditions adhered to standard of care recommendations set by local practice guidelines.</p><p>The primary endpoint in EXAMINE was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke. The study was designed to exclude a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. The median exposure to study drug was 526 days and 95% of the patients were followed to study completion or death.</p><p>Table 9 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary MACE endpoint. The upper bound of the confidence interval was 1.16 and excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3.</p><p>The Kaplan-Meier based cumulative event probability is presented in Figure 4 for the time to first occurrence of the primary MACE composite endpoint by treatment arm. The curves for placebo and alogliptin overlap throughout the duration of the study. The observed incidence of MACE was highest within the first 60 days after randomization in both treatment arms (14.8 MACE per 100 PY), decreased from day 60 to the end of the first year (8.4 per 100 PY) and was lowest after 1 year of follow-up (5.2 per 100 PY).</p><p>The rate of all cause death was similar between treatment arms with 153 (3.6 per 100 PY) recorded among patients randomized to alogliptin and 173 (4.1 per 100 PY) among patients randomized to placebo. A total of 112 deaths (2.9 per 100 PY) among patients on alogliptin and 130 among patients on placebo (3.5 per 100 PY) were adjudicated as cardiovascular deaths.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets are available in the following strengths and packages: 12.5 mg/500 mg tablet: pale yellow, oblong, film-coated tablets with "12.5/500" debossed on one side and "322M" debossed on the other side, available in:</p><p>12.5 mg/1000 mg tablet: pale yellow, oblong, film-coated tablets with "12.5/1000" debossed on one side and "322M" debossed on the other side, available in:</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Storage</span></p><p>Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].
