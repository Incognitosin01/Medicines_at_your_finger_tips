Levothyroxine is given when your thyroid does not produce enough of this hormone on its own.</p><p>Levoxyl is a prescription medicine used to treat hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone).</p><p>Levoxyl is also used to treat or prevent goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), which can be caused by hormone imbalances, radiation treatment, surgery, or cancer.</p><p>Levoxyl is also used in patients who need surgery and radioiodine therapy to manage a type of thyroid cancer called well-differentiated thyroid cancer.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You may not be able to take Levoxyl if you have certain medical conditions. Tell your doctor if you have an untreated or uncontrolled adrenal gland disorder, a thyroid disorder called thyrotoxicosis, or if you have any recent or current symptoms of a heart attack.</p><p><b>Levoxyl should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems.</b> Dangerous side effects or death can occur from the misuse of this medicine, especially if you are taking any other weight-loss medications or appetite suppressants.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p><b>Levoxyl should not be used to treat obesity or weight problems.</b> Dangerous side effects or death can occur from the misuse of levothyroxine, especially if you are taking any other weight-loss medications or appetite suppressants.</p><p>Since thyroid hormone occurs naturally in the body, almost anyone can take Levoxyl.

Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose.</p><p>Levoxyl is taken by mouth.</p><p>Levoxyl works best if you take it on an empty stomach, 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast. Follow your doctor's dosing instructions and try to take the medicine at the same time each day.</p><p>Swallow the tablet whole, with a full glass (8 ounces) of water. The Levoxyl tablet may dissolve very quickly and could swell in your throat.</p><p>When giving Levoxyl to infants and children who cannot swallow tablets the tablets may be crushed. Place the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5 mL to 10 mL or 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls) of water and immediately give the medicine by spoon or dropper. Do not store the mixed medicine or mix it with foods that decrease the absorption of levothyroxine, such as soybean-based infant formula.</p><p>It may take several weeks before your body starts to respond to levothyroxine. <b>Keep using Levoxyl even if you feel well.</b> You may need to use for the rest of your life.</p><p>You may need frequent medical tests. Tell any doctor, dentist, or surgeon who treats you that you are using .</p><p>Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.</p><p>Do not share Levoxyl with another person, even if they have the same symptoms you have.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the medicine as soon as you can, but skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at one time.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include headache, leg cramps, tremors, feeling nervous or irritable, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fast or pounding heartbeats.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>Avoid the following food products, which can make your body absorb less levothyroxine: grapefruit juice, infant soy formula, soybean flour, cotton seed meal, walnuts, and high-fiber foods.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Levoxyl:</b> hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
