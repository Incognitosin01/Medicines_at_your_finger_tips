Pegloticase should be administered in healthcare settings and by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis and infusion reactions. Patients should be premedicated with antihistamines and corticosteroids and be closely monitored for an appropriate period of time for anaphylaxis after administration of pegloticase. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and consider discontinuing treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed. Do not administer pegloticase to patients with G6PD deficiency. Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia have been reported with pegloticase in patients with G6PD deficiency. Screen patients at risk for G6PD deficiency prior to starting pegloticase .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

Gout is a condition that is caused by too much uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia).</p><p>Pegloticase injection works by causing less uric acid to be produced by the body. Pegloticase will not relieve a gout attack that has already started.</p><p>Pegloticase is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using pegloticase</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For pegloticase, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to pegloticase or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of pegloticase injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of pegloticase injection in the elderly.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving pegloticase, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using pegloticase with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Allopurinol</li>
<li>Oxypurinol</li>
<li>Probenecid</li>
<li>Sulfinpyrazone</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of pegloticase. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Congestive heart failure—Use with caution. May make this condition worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (a hereditary metabolic disorder affecting red blood cells) or</li>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of pegloticase</h2><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you pegloticase in a hospital or clinic. Pegloticase is given through a needle placed in one of your veins.</p><p>Pegloticase must be given slowly, so the needle will remain in place for a few hours (up to 2 hours or longer). You may also receive medicines (eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to help prevent possible allergic reactions to the injection.</p><p>Pegloticase is usually given every 2 weeks. If you miss a dose or forget to receive your medicine, call your doctor for instructions.</p><p>Pegloticase should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using pegloticase</h2><p><i>Your doctor will check you closely while you are receiving pegloticase</i>.

Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Pegloticase may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, hives, itching, dizziness, swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or tongue, trouble breathing or swallowing, or chest pain after you receive the medicine.</p><p>Pegloticase may cause infusion reactions, such as a rash, itching, or redness of the skin, difficulty with breathing, feeling of warmth or redness of the face, neck, arms, and occasionally, upper chest, or chest discomfort or pain while you are receiving the injection or within 2 hours after you receive it. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms.</p><p>Patients of African, Mediterranean, or Southern Asian ancestry are at higher risk of serious side effects and should be carefully evaluated by their doctor before starting pegloticase.</p><p>Gout flares may occur in the first 3 months when you start receiving pegloticase. Do not stop receiving pegloticase even if you have a gout flare. Your doctor may give you medicines (eg, colchicine, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug or NSAID) to reduce and prevent worsening of the gout.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
