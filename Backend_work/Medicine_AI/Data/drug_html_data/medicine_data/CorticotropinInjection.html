It is also used to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Corticotropin will not cure MS, but it may slow some of the disabling effects and decrease the number of flare-ups (relapses) of the disease.</p><p>Repository corticotropin injection is also used to treat joint disorders (eg, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus or SLE, polymyositis), and certain conditions of the skin (eg, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), eyes (eg, keratitis, diffuse posterior uveitis and choroiditis, optic neuritis), and lungs (eg, sarcoidosis). It is also used to treat certain allergies (eg, serum sickness) and swelling (edema) of the body.</p><p>Corticotropin is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using corticotropin</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Avoid being near people who are sick or have infections while you are using corticotropin. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</p><p>Using too much of corticotropin or using it for a long time may increase your risk of having adrenal gland problems (eg, Cushing's syndrome). The risk is greater for children and patients who use large amounts for a long time. Talk to your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms while you are using corticotropin: blurred vision, dizziness or fainting, a fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat, fractures, increased thirst or urination, irritability, round or "moon" face, neck, or trunk, stomach pain, thin skin or easy bruising, weight gain or loss, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</p><p>Corticotropin may cause fluid retention (edema) in some patients. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions about any special diet (especially on salt intake).</p><p>Corticotropin may mask or hide symptoms of other diseases while you are using it. Check with your doctor if you or your child have symptoms of infection, black, tarry stools, changes in body weight, difficulty with breathing, fast heart rate, increased thirst, stomach pain, unusual tiredness, or vomiting.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you start having severe abdominal or stomach burning, cramps, or pains, bloody or black, tarry stools, constipation or diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, or vomiting of material that looks like coffee grounds. These could be symptoms of a serious stomach or bowel problem.</p><p>Corticotropin may cause changes in mood and behavior. Check with your doctor if you or your child have trouble sleeping, feeling depressed or irritable, mood swings, or other changes in behavior.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have any changes to your eyes, such as redness, itching, swelling, or vision changes while you are using corticotropin. Your doctor may want your eyes to be checked by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist).</p><p>Corticotropin may decrease bone mineral density when used for a long time. A low bone mineral density can cause slow growth and may lead to osteoporosis at any age. If you have any questions about this ask your doctor.</p><p><i>Do not stop using corticotropin suddenly without checking first with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you or your child to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
