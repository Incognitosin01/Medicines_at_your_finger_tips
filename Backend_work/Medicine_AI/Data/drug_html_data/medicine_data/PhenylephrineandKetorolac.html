Following irrigation with diluted phenylephrine/ketorolac solution, plasma concentrations of phenylephrine were 1.2 to 1.4 ng/mL within 2 hours  and plasma concentrations of ketorolac were 1 to 4.2 ng/mL within 8 hours.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Ophthalmic surgical irrigation:</b> Added to an ophthalmic irrigation solution to maintain pupil size by preventing intraoperative miosis and reducing postoperative ocular pain during cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to phenylephrine, ketorolac, or any component of the formulation</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Surgical irrigation:</b> Ophthalmic: Use diluted irrigation solution as needed during the surgical procedure.</p><h2>Dosing: Geriatric</h2><p>Refer to adult dosing.</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Surgical irrigation:</b> Infants, Children, and Adolescents: Ophthalmic: Use diluted irrigation solution as needed during the surgical procedure for a single patient.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Prior to use, dilute 4 mL of phenylephrine 1%/ketorolac 0.3% solution in 500 mL of ophthalmic irrigation solution.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For ophthalmic irrigation during surgery.  Must be diluted prior to use. Do not use if irrigation solution is cloudy or contains particulate matter.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store between 20°C and 25°C (68°F and 77°F). Protect from light. Following dilution in ophthalmic irrigation solution, do not store for more than 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours under refrigeration.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Alpha1-Blockers: May diminish the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha1-Agonists. Similarly, Alpha1-Agonists may antagonize Alpha1-Blocker vasodilation.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>AtoMOXetine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. AtoMOXetine may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cannabinoid-Containing Products: May enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cocaine (Topical): May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Consider alternatives to use of this combination when possible. Monitor closely for substantially increased blood pressure or heart rate and for any evidence of myocardial ischemia with concurrent use.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Corticosteroids (Ophthalmic): Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Ophthalmic) may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Corticosteroids (Ophthalmic). Healing of ophthalmic tissue during concomitant administration of ophthalmic products may be delayed. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Doxofylline: Sympathomimetics may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Doxofylline. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Ergot Derivatives: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha1-Agonists. Ergot Derivatives may enhance the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha1-Agonists.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Guanethidine: May enhance the arrhythmogenic effect of Sympathomimetics. Guanethidine may enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Iobenguane Radiopharmaceutical Products: Alpha1-Agonists may diminish the therapeutic effect of Iobenguane Radiopharmaceutical Products.  Management: Discontinue all drugs that may inhibit or interfere with catecholamine transport or uptake for at least 5 biological half-lives before iobenguane administration. Do not administer these drugs until at least 7 days after each iobenguane dose.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Linezolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Reduce initial doses of sympathomimetic agents, and closely monitor for enhanced pressor response, in patients receiving linezolid.  Specific dose adjustment recommendations are not presently available.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha1-Agonists. While linezolid is expected to interact via this mechanism, management recommendations differ from other monoamine oxidase inhibitors.  Refer to linezolid specific monographs for details.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Ozanimod: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Concomitant use of ozanimod with sympathomimetic agents is not recommended. If combined, monitor patients closely for the development of hypertension, including hypertensive crises.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Prostaglandins (Ophthalmic): Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Ophthalmic) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Prostaglandins (Ophthalmic). Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Ophthalmic) may enhance the therapeutic effect of Prostaglandins (Ophthalmic). <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Solriamfetol: Sympathomimetics may enhance the hypertensive effect of Solriamfetol. Sympathomimetics may enhance the tachycardic effect of Solriamfetol. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sympathomimetics: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tedizolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Tedizolid may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tricyclic Antidepressants: May enhance the therapeutic effect of Alpha1-Agonists. Tricyclic Antidepressants may diminish the therapeutic effect of Alpha1-Agonists.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>&gt;10%: Ophthalmic: Anterior chamber inflammation (24%)</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Foreign body sensation of eye (2%)</p><p>Ophthalmic: Increased intraocular pressure (4%), posterior capsule opacification (4%), eye irritation (2%)</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Cross sensitivity or hypersensitivity may occur in patients with previous sensitivities to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid, or other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Use caution in patients with known sensitivities to these medications. Bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma has been reported following ketorolac use in patients with previous sensitivity to aspirin/NSAIDs or history of asthma.</p><p>•	 Hypertension: Low concentrations of phenylephrine can be detected systemically following ophthalmic irrigation and may cause elevations in blood pressure.</p><p>• Light sensitivity (ocular): May cause sensitivity to light.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Systemic exposure following ophthalmic irrigation is low. Because premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus has occurred with third trimester use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the manufacturer recommends avoiding use of this product in late in pregnancy.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used during eye surgery.</p><p>• It is used to lower eye pain after eye surgery.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
