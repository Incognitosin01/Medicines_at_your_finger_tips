It works by increasing the levels of certain proteins in the body that can dilate (widen) blood vessels. This helps lower blood pressure by reducing sodium levels.</p><p>Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (sometimes called an ARB). Valsartan keeps blood vessels from narrowing, which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow.</p><p>Entresto is used in certain people with chronic heart failure. This medicine helps lower the risk of needing to be hospitalized when symptoms get worse, and helps lower the risk of death from heart failure.</p><p>Entresto is also used to treat heart failure in children who are at least 1 year old.</p><p>Entresto is usually given together with other heart medications.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p><b>Do not use Entresto if you are pregnant.
