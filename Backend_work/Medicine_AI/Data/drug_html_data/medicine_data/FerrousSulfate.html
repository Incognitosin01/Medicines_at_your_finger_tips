In your body, iron becomes a part of your hemoglobin and myoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen through your blood to tissues and organs. Myoglobin helps your muscle cells store oxygen.</p><p>Ferrous Sulfate is an essential body mineral. Ferrous sulfate is used to treat iron deficiency anemia (a lack of red blood cells caused by having too little iron in the body).</p><p>Ferrous sulfate may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist if it is safe for you to take ferrous sulfate if you have iron overload syndrome, hemolytic anemia (a lack of red blood cells), porphyria (a genetic enzyme disorder that causes symptoms affecting the skin or nervous system), thalassemia (a genetic disorder of red blood cells), if you are an alcoholic, or if you receive regular blood transfusions.</p><p>Seek emergency medical attention if you think you have used too much of this medicine, or if anyone has accidentally swallowed it. An overdose of iron can be fatal, especially in a young child.</p><p>Overdose symptoms may include nausea, severe stomach pain, bloody diarrhea, coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds, shallow breathing, weak and rapid pulse, pale skin, blue lips, and seizure (convulsions).</p><p>Take ferrous sulfate on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Avoid taking antacids or antibiotics within 2 hours before or after taking ferrous sulfate.</p><p>Ferrous sulfate is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include a special diet. It is very important to follow the diet plan created for you by your doctor or nutrition counselor. You should become very familiar with the list of foods you should eat to make sure you get enough iron from both your diet and your medication.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>Ask a doctor or pharmacist if it is safe for you to take ferrous sulfate if you have:</p><ul>

Avoid taking antacids or antibiotics within 2 hours before or after taking ferrous sulfate . Take ferrous sulfate with a full glass of water. Do not crush, chew, break, or open an extended-release tablet or capsule. Swallow the pill whole. Breaking or opening the pill may cause too much of the drug to be released at one time.</p><p>Shake the oral suspension (liquid) well just before you measure a dose. Measure the liquid with a special dose-measuring spoon or medicine cup, not with a regular table spoon. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.</p><p>Ferrous sulfate can stain your teeth, but this effect is temporary. To prevent tooth staining, mix the liquid form of ferrous sulfate with water or fruit juice (not with milk) and drink the mixture through a straw. You may also clean your teeth with baking soda once per week to treat any tooth staining.</p><p>Ferrous sulfate is only part of a complete program of treatment that may also include a special diet.
