Use the medicine exactly as directed. You may need to use  epoprostenol for many years.</p><p>You may receive your first dose in a hospital or clinic setting to quickly treat any serious side effects. Your blood pressure and heart rate may also need to be monitored whenever your dose is changed.</p><p>Epoprostenol is injected with an infusion pump, usually through a permanent central intravenous (IV) catheter placed into a large vein such as in your chest.

Do not use epoprostenol if you don't understand all instructions for proper use. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.</p><p>Prepare your injection only when you are ready to give it. Do not use if the medicine has changed colors or has particles in it. Call your pharmacist for new medicine.</p><p>You should not stop using epoprostenol suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping suddenly may make your condition worse.</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms do not improve, or if they get worse.</p><p>To make sure there is no interruption in your treatment, you may need to have a back-up infusion pump, replacement batteries, and extra IV infusion sets.
