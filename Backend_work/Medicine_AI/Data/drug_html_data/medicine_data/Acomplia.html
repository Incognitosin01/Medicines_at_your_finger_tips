<li>Acomplia (rimonabant) was the first in a new class of therapeutic agents called Cannabinoid-1 Receptor Blockers (CB1).</li>
<li>Acomplia was studied for use in the treatment of obesity and related conditions.</li>
</ul><h2>How does Acomplia work?</h2><ul>
<li>Acomplia acts by selectively blocking CB1 receptors found in the brain and in peripheral organs important in glucose and lipid (or fat) metabolism, including adipose tissue, the liver, gastrointestinal tract and muscle<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li>Acomplia switches off the same brain circuits that make people hungry when they smoke cannabis.</li>
<li>CB1 receptor blockade with Acomplia acts to decrease the overactivity of the endocannabinoid system (EC system).<sup>3,4</sup> The EC system is a recently characterised physiological system that includes receptors such as the CB1 receptor and it has been shown to play an important role in regulating body weight and in controlling energy balance, as well as glucose and lipid (or fat) metabolism.</li>
</ul><h2>What is Acomplia used for?</h2><ul>
<li>Acomplia was studied to be used complementary to diet and exercise to treat obese or overweight patients who suffer from type 2 diabetes and abnormal levels of fat in the blood.</li>
<li>Sanofi argued that Acomplia could also prevent the risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>
<li>Patients with large waist circumference (102 cm in men and 88 cm in women) were said to most benefit from taking the drug.</li>
</ul><h2>Does Acomplia also aid smoking cessation?</h2><ul>
<li>Acomplia (Zimulti in the US) was studied by Sanofi-Aventis as an aid to smoking cessation based on studies for up to one year in over 6,500 smokers motivated to quit smoking.</li>
<li>Sanofi-Aventis submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA, which in turn issued a non-approvable letter for Zimulti for use in smoking cessation. In June of 2007, the FDA's Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended against the approval of rimonabant due to concerns over serious side effects such as suicidality.</li>
</ul><h2>What were the results of Acomplia clinical trial studies?</h2><ul>
<li>In clinical studies, Acomplia was has been shown to improve a wide array of cardiometabolic risk factors as well as promoting sustained weight loss.<sup>5,6</sup></li>
<li>Approximately half of the observed improvement in HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and HbA1C (an indicator of blood sugar control) in patients who received Acomplia 20mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone.<sup>7</sup></li>
<li>Serious psychological adverse effects, such as suicidality and depression led to the eventual global withdrawal of rimonabant by Sanofi-Aventis.</li>
