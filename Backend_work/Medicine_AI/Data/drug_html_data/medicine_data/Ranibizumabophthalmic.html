It works by keeping new blood vessels from forming under the retina (a sensory membrane that lines the inside of the eye). In people with certain types of eye disorders, new blood vessels grow under the retina where they leak blood and fluid.</p><p>Ranibizumab ophthalmic (for the eyes) is used to treat the "wet form" of age-related macular degeneration. Ranibizumab is also used to treat swelling in the retina caused by diabetes or by a blockage in the blood vessels.</p><p>Ranibizumab may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive ranibizumab if you are allergic to it, or if you have any type of infection in or around your eyes.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have sudden vision problems, eye pain or redness, or if your eyes are more sensitive to light.</p><p>The timing of your monthly injections is very important for this medication to be effective.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive ranibizumab if you are allergic to it, or if you have any type of infection in or around your eyes.</p><p>To make sure ranibizumab is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:</p><ul>
