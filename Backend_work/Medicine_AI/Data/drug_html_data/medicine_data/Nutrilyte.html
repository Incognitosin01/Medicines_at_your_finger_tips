</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Rx Only</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Not for direct infusion. For prescription compounding of intravenous admixtures only. Concentrated solution. Dilute to appropriate strength with suitable intravenous fluid prior to administration.</span></p><h2>Nutrilyte Description</h2><p class="First">Nutrilyte (Multi-Electrolyte Concentrate) is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, concentrated solution of intra- and extracellular electrolytes, excluding phosphate. No antimicrobial agent has been added.</p><p>It is available in a 20 mL single dose preparation and a 100 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package.</p><p>The 100 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package contains many doses for use in a pharmacy admixture program in the preparation of parenteral fluids. See directions for dispensing from the 100 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package.</p><p>pH (6.3 to 7.0) adjusted with Glacial Acetic Acid when necessary.</p><p><span class="Bold">Calculated Osmolarity:</span> Approximately 7562 mOsmol/Liter; 7.562 mOsmol/ mL.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h2><p class="First">Nutrilyte Concentrate provides a source of intra- and extracellular electrolytes in suitable amounts, to help maintain normal cellular metabolism during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and other parenteral therapy in adults. Use of properly diluted Nutrilyte meets most adult daily electrolyte requirements and provides adjunctive therapy for replenishment of depleted electrolyte stores.</p><p><span class="Bold">Intracellular</span><span class="Bold">:</span> Potassium, the principal intracellular cation, maintains the integrity of the cellular membrane, helps transport dextrose across the cell membrane and contributes to normal renal function: Magnesium, the second most concentrated intracellular cation, acts as an important cofactor in enzymatic reactions and helps to maintain normal central nervous system activity and amino acid utilization. Calcium participates in the maintenance of normal neuromuscular functions and blood coagulation.</p><p><span class="Bold">Extracellular</span><span class="Bold">:</span> Chloride, the primary extracellular anion, contributes to the maintenance of acid-base balance. Sodium, the principal extracellular cation, acts in conjunction with potassium to maintain integrity of the cell membrane. Sodium also helps to maintain motor nerve depolarization, normal renal metabolism and fluid balance. Acetate is a bicarbonate alternate and an important intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Nutrilyte</h2><p class="First">Nutrilyte Concentrate is indicated for use as a supplement to parenteral nutritional solutions containing amino acids, dextrose and/or other calorie sources delivered by central venous or peripheral infusion to facilitate amino acid utilization and maintain electrolyte balance in adults.</p><p>Nutrilyte Concentrate is also indicated as a source of replacement electrolytes for the depleted adult patient during parenteral therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Nutrilyte Concentrate is contraindicated in clinical conditions where additives of potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium or chloride could be clinically detrimental. Such conditions include anuria, hyperkalemia, heart block or myocardial damage and edema due to cardiovascular, renal or hepatic failure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nutrilyte Concentrate is not intended for pediatric use.</span></p><p>Use only if solution is clear and seal intact.</p><h2>WARNINGS</h2><h2>Precautions</h2><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in Nutrilyte Multi-Electrolyte Concentrate. Therefore, frequent monitoring of blood electrolyte levels is essential.</p><p>Sodium excess can cause edema and subsequent congestive heart failure in patients with cardiovascular insufficiency.</p><p>Potassium excess can cause an abnormal electrocardiogram, cardiac arrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest, paresthesias and flaccid paralysis, mental confusion and weakness.</p><p>Potassium deficit can impair neuromuscular function and cause intestinal dilatation and ileus.</p><p>Magnesium excess can cause muscular weakness, flushing, sweating, hypotension, circulatory collapse and depression of cardiac and central nervous system function. Magnesium deficiency can cause hyperirritability, psychotic behavior, tachycardia, hypertension and neuromuscular dysfunction.</p><p>Calcium excess can cause depression, headaches, drowsiness, disorientation, syncope, dysphagia, hypotonia of skeletal and smooth muscles, arrhythmias and coma. Calcium deficits can produce neuromuscular hyperexcitabilty (paresthesias, cramps, tetany and grand mal seizures).</p><p>Phosphorus deficiency may lead to impaired tissue oxygenation and acute hemolytic anemia. Relative to calcium, excessive phosphorus intake can precipitate hypocalcemia with ensuing neuromuscular hyperexcitabilty.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First">For adults, one 20 mL dose of Nutrilyte should be added to each liter of amino acid/dextrose solution (TPN) or other suitable intravenous solution.</p><p><span class="Bold">Route</span><span class="Bold">:</span> Nutrilyte Concentrate is for prescription compounding of intravenous admixtures only. The solution is strongly hypertonic. Not for direct patient injection. Dilute to appropriate strength with suitable intravenous fluid prior to administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">DIRECTIONS FOR DISPENSING FROM 100 mL PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE—NOT FOR DIRECT INFUSION</span></p><p>The 100 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package is for use in a Pharmacy Admixture Service only. The 100 mL Pharmacy Bulk Package should be suspended (inverted) by its IV hang label in a laminar flow hood or biological safety cabinet. Prior to entering a Pharmacy Bulk Package, remove the flip-off seal and cleanse the rubber closure with a suitable antiseptic agent. Entry into the Pharmacy Bulk Package must be made with a sterile transfer set or other sterile dispensing device and the contents dispensed in aliquots using aseptic technique. Use of a syringe needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage. ANY UNUSED PORTION MUST BE DISCARDED WITHIN 4 HOURS AFTER INITIAL ENTRY. The date and the time initially opened should be recorded in the space provided on the Pharmacy Bulk Package label.</p><p>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">Nutrilyte<span class="Sup">®</span> (Multi-Electrolyte Concentrate)</p><p>NDC 0517-3120-25              20 mL Single Dose Vial                             Boxes of 25<br/>
