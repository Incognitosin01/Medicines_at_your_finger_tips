Most research examines the plant's use against vector-borne diseases and as an insect repellent.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>Numerous dosage forms (ie, tablets, pellets, granules) are available commercially. However, clinical trials are lacking to provide dosing recommendations for African mint.</p><h3>Contraindications</h3><p>Hypersensitivity to any of the chemical components of O. canum.</p><h3>Pregnancy/Lactation</h3><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h3>Interactions</h3><p>None well documented.</p><h3>Adverse Reactions</h3><p>A small clinical study reported abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and constipation in patients consuming 15 g/day of O. canum seeds.</p><h3>Toxicology</h3><p>Information is limited. The estragole constituent of O. canum is carcinogenic.</p><h2>Scientific Family</h2><ul><li>Lamiaceae</li></ul><h2>Botany</h2><p>The aromatic O. canum is a semiperennial plant species found in Africa and Asia. The plant grows up to 60 cm in height, with multiple branches originating from its base. It has elliptic-lanceolate leaves that are slightly pointed at both ends, and long pale white to pinkish flower spikes.Naghibi 2005, Ngassoum 2004, Vieira 2003, USDA 2016</p><p>O. canum is synonymous with Ocimum americanum Auct., and related plants include Ocimum basilicum (sweet basil), Ocimum gratissimum (African basil), Ocimum campechianum (Amazonian basil), and Ocimum tenuiflorum/sanctum (holy basil).</p><h2>History</h2><p>The plant is used medicinally in Africa to treat conjunctivitis, malaria, and headache, and has been used as an analgesic and rubefacient.Ngassoum 2004, Nyarko 2002 It also has been used to manage diabetes mellitus in Ghana.Nyarko 2002 Ethnopharmacology studies document its use in treating dysuria in Iran.Naghibi 2005 The essential oils of the plant species have been used mainly for antipyretic purposes and for treating respiratory diseases on the eastern coast of Africa.Martins 1999, Ngassoum 2004</p><p>The aerial plant parts have been used with other spices for culinary purposes. The essential leaf and flower oils have been used as flavoring in foods, chewing gums, sweets, teas, soft drinks, energy drinks, and milk products. The oils are also used in cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, shower gels, body lotions, and toothpastes.Ngassoum 2004</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>An essential oil present in the aerial parts of the plant is rich in camphor and linalool, and includes varying amounts of methyl cinnamate, citronella and citral derivatives, and eugenol, among others. Dipentene, terpinolene, crithmene, limonene, pinene, sabinene, camphene, and caryophyllene have been identified, and polysaccharides (including xylose, arabinose, rhamnose, and galactose) have been described. Content varies according to geographical location and harvesting times, with resultant various chemical constituents such as methyl cinnamate, citral, eugenol, camphor being the most prominent.Berhow 2012, Duke 2016, Nascimento 2011, Pandey 2014, Vieira 2003, Vieira 2014, Vyry 2014, Xaasan 1981</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><h3>Anti-inflammatory activity</h3><p>O. canum showed significant anti-inflammatory activity against carrageenan, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, leukotriene, and arachidonic acid–induced paw edema.Singh 1998 Anti-inflammatory activity may be associated with the essential oils and linolenic acid content, which can block both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonate metabolism.Setty 2005, Singh 1998 In vitro antioxidant activity has also been demonstrated.George 2009, Saeio 2011</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding anti-inflammatory use of O. canum.</p><h3>Antimicrobial activity</h3><p>In vitro, the oil from O. canum leaves, but not the flowers, was active against some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,Bassole 2005, Cimanga 2002, Tajo 1999, Vyry 2014 and also possessed antifungal activity.Yadav 1994 The essential oil of O. canum possesses activity against mosquito and tick larvae.Cavalcanti 2004, Inbaneson 2012, Jayaseelan 2012, Murugan 2016 The plant and essential oil are used in Africa to protect agricultural crops from insect damage,Belmain 2001, Khanom 2000, Lehman 2007, Pandey 1994 and as a mosquito repellent.Pålsson 1999, Seyoum 2002, Seyoum 2002, Tawatsin 2001</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding antimicrobial use of O. canum.</p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p>Limited studies conducted in rodents suggest constituents of the plant (especially eugenol and rosmarinic acid) may exert effects in lowering blood glucose, possibly by increasing insulin release.Berhow 2012, Nyarko 2002, Singh 2016</p><p>Research reveals no clinical data regarding use of O. canum for diabetes.</p><h3>Dyslipidemia</h3><p>In a study in mice, O. canum decreased serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.Nyarko 2002</p><p>One small (N=30), 12-week clinical study examined the clinical outcome of nutrition counseling with O. canum seed supplementation (15 g daily) on serum lipid levels, finding no benefit to the lipid profile.Kangsadalampai 2007</p><h3>Other uses</h3><p>Limited studies in mice suggest extracts of O. canum reduce tumor volume and increase survival.Monga 2011 Protective effects against irradiation were also reportedMonga 2011; however, the chemical constituent estragole is considered carcinogenic.De Vincenzi 2000</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>Numerous dosage forms (ie, tablets, pellets, granules) are available commercially. However, clinical trials are lacking to provide dosing recommendations for African mint.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Avoid use. Information regarding safety and efficacy in pregnancy and lactation is lacking.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Information is limited, despite the traditional use of O. canum. A 12-week clinical trial documented abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and constipation in patients consuming 15 g/day of O. canum seeds.Kangsadalampai 2007</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Information is limited.
