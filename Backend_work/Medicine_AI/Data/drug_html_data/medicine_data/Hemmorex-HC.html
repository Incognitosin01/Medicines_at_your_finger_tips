<br/>
For Rectal Administration</p><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><p class="First">Hydrocortisone acetate is a corticosteroid designed chemically as pregn-4-ene 3, 20-dione, 21-(acetyloxy)-11, 17-dihydroxy––(11 β) with the following structural formula:</p><p></p><p>Each rectal suppository contains hydrocortisone acetate, USP 25 mg in a specially blended hydrogenated vegetable oil base.</p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">In normal subjects, about 26% of hydrocortisone acetate is absorbed when the suppository is applied to the rectum. Absorption of hydrocortisone acetate may vary across abraded or inflamed surfaces. Topical steroids are primarily effective because of their anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive action.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First">Hemmorex-HC™ suppositories are indicated for use in inflamed hemorrhoids, post-irradiation (factitial) proctitis; as an adjunct in the treatment of chronic ulcerative colitis; cryptitis; and other inflammatory conditions of anorectum and pruritus ani.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Hemmorex-HC™ suppositories are contraindicated in those patients having a history of hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone acetate or any of the components.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Do not use Hemmorex-HC™ suppositories unless adequate proctologic examination is made. If irritation develops, the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of an infection, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, Hemmorex-HC™ should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis:</h3><p class="First">No long term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of corticosteroid suppositories.</p><h3>Pregnancy Category C:</h3><p class="First">In laboratory animals, topical steroids have been associated with an increase in the incidence of fetal abnormalities when gestating females have been exposed to rather low dosage levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Hemmorex-HC™ suppositories should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time.</p><p>It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk and because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Hemmorex-HC™ suppositories, a decision should be</p><p>made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First">The following local adverse reactions have been reported with corticosteroid suppositories; burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypopigmentation, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection.</p><h2>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE:</h2><p class="First">Drug abuse and dependence have not been reported in patients treated with Hemmorex-HC™ suppositories.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE:</h2><p class="First">If signs and symptoms of systemic overdosage occur, discontinue use.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">For rectal administration.
