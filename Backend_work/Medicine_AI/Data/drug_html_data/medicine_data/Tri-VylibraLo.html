</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Stop Tri-Vylibra Lo if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic (VTE) event occurs.</li>
<li>Stop Tri-Vylibra Lo if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</li>
<li>If feasible, stop Tri-Vylibra Lo at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization.</li>
<li>Start Tri-Vylibra Lo no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.</li>
<li>The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</li>
<li>Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke.</li>
<li>Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</li>
</ul><h3>Liver Disease</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Impaired Liver Function<br/></span></p><p>Do not use Tri-Vylibra Lo in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Tri-Vylibra Lo if jaundice develops.</p><p><span class="Bold">Liver Tumors<br/></span></p><p>Tri-Vylibra Lo is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p><p>Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (&gt;8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.</p><h3>Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment</h3><p class="First">During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such <span class="following_xmChange">as</span> COCs. Discontinue Tri-Vylibra Lo prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)]</span>. Tri-Vylibra Lo can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.</p><h3>High Blood Pressure</h3><p class="First">Tri-Vylibra Lo is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease <span class="Italics">[see</span> <span class="Italics">Contraindications (4)</span>]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Tri-Vylibra Lo if blood pressure rises significantly.<br/>
<br/>
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.</p><h3>Gallbladder Disease</h3><p class="First">Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis.</p><h3>Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects</h3><p class="First">Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri-Vylibra Lo. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance.<br/>
<br/>
Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.<br/>
<br/>
Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.</p><h3>Headache</h3><p class="First">If a woman taking Tri-Vylibra Lo develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri-Vylibra Lo if indicated.<br/>
<br/>
Consider discontinuation of Tri-Vylibra Lo in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).</p><h3>Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting<br/></span></p><p>Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.<br/>
<br/>
In the clinical trial of Tri-Vylibra Lo, the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,673 women (11,015 evaluable cycles). A total of 3 (0.2%) women discontinued Tri-Vylibra Lo, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 7 to 17% of women using Tri-Vylibra Lo experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea<br/></span><br/>
Women who use Tri-Vylibra Lo may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.<br/>
<br/>
If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</p><h3>COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Discontinue Tri-Vylibra Lo use if pregnancy is confirmed.</p><p>Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Tri-Vylibra Lo if depression recurs to a serious degree.</p><h3>Carcinoma of Breast and Cervix</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Tri-Vylibra Lo is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>.</li>
</ul><p class="First">There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</li>
</ul><h3>Effect on Binding Globulins</h3><p class="First">The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased.</p><h3>Monitoring</h3><p class="First">A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.</p><h3>Hereditary Angioedema</h3><p class="First">In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema.</p><h3>Chloasma</h3><p class="First">Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri-Vylibra Lo.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Serious  cardiovascular  events  and  stroke  <span class="Italics">[see  Boxed  Warning and  Warnings  and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Vascular events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Liver disease <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
</ul><p>Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Irregular uterine bleeding</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Breast tenderness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trial Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>The safety of Tri-Vylibra Lo was evaluated in 1,723 subjects who participated in a randomized, partially blinded, multicenter, active-controlled clinical trial of Tri-Vylibra Lo for contraception.

<li>COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation.

Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception, when possible, until she has weaned her child. COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well-established; however, it can occur at any time in some women. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites are present in breast milk.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and efficacy of Tri-Vylibra Lo tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Efficacy is expected to be the same for post-pubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Tri-Vylibra Lo has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of Tri-Vylibra Lo has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment.

</ul><p></p><h2>Tri-Vylibra Lo - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation. Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Tri-Vylibra Lo.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Norgestimate (NGM) and EE are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass (intestinal and/or hepatic) mechanisms to norelgestromin (NGMN) and norgestrel (NG), which are the major active metabolites of NGM.</p><p>Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for NGMN, NG and EE during three cycles of administration of Tri-Vylibra Lo are summarized in Table 3.</p><p>Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE were generally reached by 2 hours after administration of Tri-Vylibra Lo. Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 0.180 mg NGM / 0.025 mg EE dose is approximately 1.5 to 2 fold for NGMN and approximately 1.5 fold for EE compared with single dose administration, in agreement with that predicted based on linear kinetics of NGMN and EE. The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose proportional following NGM doses of 0.180 to 0.250 mg. Steady-state conditions for NGMN following each NGM dose and for EE were achieved during the three cycle study. Non-linear accumulation (4.5 to 14.5 fold) of NG was observed as a result of high affinity binding to SHBG, which limits its biological activity.</p><p>Table 3 Summary of NGMN, NG and EE pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p><span class="Italics">Food Effect</span></p><p><span class="Italics"> </span></p><p>The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of Tri-Vylibra Lo has not been studied.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>NGMN and NG are highly bound (&gt;97%) to serum proteins. NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG, while NG is bound primarily to SHBG. EE is extensively bound (&gt;97%) to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG.</p><p><span class="Bold">Metabolism<br/></span><br/>
NGM is extensively metabolized by first-pass mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract and/or liver. NGM’s primary active metabolite is NGMN. Subsequent hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include NG, which is also active and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. Although NGMN and its metabolites inhibit a variety of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes, under the recommended dosing regimen, the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> concentrations of NGMN and its metabolites, even at the peak serum levels, are relatively low compared to the inhibitory constant (K<span class="Sub">i</span>). EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.</p><p><span class="Bold">Excretion<br/></span><br/>
Following 3 cycles of administration of Tri-Vylibra Lo, the mean (± SD) elimination half-life values, at steady-state, for NGMN, NG and EE were 28.1 (± 10.6) hours, 36.4 (± 10.2) hours and 17.7 (± 4.4) hours, respectively (Table 2). The metabolites of NGMN and EE are eliminated by renal and fecal pathways.</p><p><span class="Bold">Use in Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold"> </span></p><p><span class="Italics">Effects of Body Weight, Body Surface Area, and Age</span></p><p>The effects of body weight, body surface area, age and race on the pharmacokinetics of NGMN, NG and EE were evaluated in 79 healthy women using pooled data following single dose administration of NGM 0.180 or 0.250 mg/EE 0.025 mg tablets in four pharmacokinetic studies. Increasing body weight and body surface area were each associated with decreases in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> values for NGMN and EE and increases in CL/F (oral clearance) for EE. Increasing body weight by 10 kg is predicted to reduce the following parameters: NGMN C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 9% and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> by 19%, NG C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 12% and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> by 46%, EE C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 13% and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> by 12%. These changes were statistically significant. Increasing age was associated with slight decreases (6% with increasing age by 5 years) in C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">0-24h</span> for NGMN and were statistically significant, but there was no significant effect for NG or EE. Only a small to moderate fraction (5 to 40%) of the overall variability in the pharmacokinetics of NGMN and EE following Tri-Vylibra Lo tablets may be explained by any or all of the above demographic parameters.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1).]   </span></p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">In an active controlled clinical trial lasting 12 months, 1,673 women, 18 to 45 years old completed 11,003 cycles of Tri-Vylibra Lo use and a total of 20 pregnancies were reported in Tri-Vylibra Lo users.

Do birth control pills cause cancer?<br/></span><br/>
Birth control pills do not seem to cause breast cancer. However, if you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.<br/>
<br/>
Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
What if I want to become pregnant?<br/></span><br/>
You may stop taking the pill whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the pill.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
What should I know about my period when taking Tri-Vylibra Lo?<br/></span><br/>
Your periods may be lighter and shorter than usual. Some women may miss a period. Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may happen while you are taking Tri-Vylibra Lo, especially during the first few months of use. This usually is not a serious problem. It is important to continue taking your pills on a regular schedule to prevent a pregnancy.<br/>
