The diagnosis of acute or chronic topical pain can be made relatively simply by the diagnostic practitioner, however discovering the underlying pathology manifesting as pain and discomfort is much more difficult.

• NOTE: serious side effects are, in general, related to accidental toxicity of medication by applying considerably more than directed by your doctor or pharmacist or by ingesting the contents of the patch.<br/>
• Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take.<br/>
This includes prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements<br/>

Safely discard the remaining unused pieces of cut patches where children and pets cannot get to them.<br/>
2. Remove the transparent release liner (clear plastic backing) before application of patches to the skin. Apply immediately after removal from the protective envelope.<br/>

_____________________________________________________</p><p>PRESCRIBER INFORMATION</p><p>Relyyks Patch® (Menthol 5% / Lidocaine HCl 4%Transdermal Patch )</p><p>DESCRIPTION:</p><p>Relyyks Patch® is a prescription transdermal patch containing 10 articulated patches (5 per resealable pouch x 2 pouches). Lidocaine HCl is present in a 4% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide and has an empirical formula of C14H22N2O. The molecular weight of lidocaine HCl is 234.34 g/mol. Menthol is present in a 6% concentration (w/w). The chemical name is (1R,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol. The empirical formula for menthol is C10H20O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol.</p><p>The structural formulas are:</p><p>** Menthol ** ** Lidocaine**</p><p>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</p><p>Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.</p><p>Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it also acts as a weak kappa (κ) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol acts to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin - responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it stimulates when applied directly to the skin. Menthol's analgesic properties are not fully understood, however they are mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.</p><p>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</p><p>Relyyks Patch® is a formulation used to assist patients in the treatment of mild to moderate acute or chronic aches or pain. Muscle or joint pain can be due to musculoligamentous strains, simple backache, tendonitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy or post herpetic neuralgia, and other complex regional pains. It can also be used to help with certain types of headaches, but use with caution when applying in order to avoid eye contact. If consulted by your physician, it may be used for other conditions as well</p><p>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</p><p>Known hypersensitivity to menthol, lidocaine, or any of the topical amide-like anesthetic preparations. .</p><p>WARNINGS:</p><p>Excessive dosage, or short interval between doses, can result in high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Patients should be instructed to strictly adhere to the recommended dosage and administration guidelines set forth in this literature and on your prescription label. The management of serious adverse reactions may require the use of resuscitative equipment, oxygen or other resuscitative drugs.</p><p>PRECAUTIONS:</p><p>Because of the possibility of sedation, patients should be cautioned regarding the operation of serious machinery or automobiles, and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness.<br/>
