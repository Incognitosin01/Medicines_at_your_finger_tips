It is also sometimes used to treat some other kinds of cancer in both males and females.</p><p>Etoposide belongs to the group of medicines known as antineoplastic agents. The exact way that etoposide acts against cancer is not known. However, it seems to interfere with the growth of the cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal body cells may also be affected by etoposide, other effects will also occur. Some of these may be serious and must be reported to your doctor. Other effects, like hair loss, may not be serious but may cause concern. Some effects may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.</p><p>Before you begin treatment with etoposide, you and your doctor should talk about the benefits of this medicine as well as the risks of using it.</p><p>This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Dom-Etoposide</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of etoposide injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of etoposide injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted side effects (eg, infection, nausea and vomiting, hair loss), and have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution in elderly patients receiving etoposide injection.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of Dom-Etoposide</h2><p><b>This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain etoposide.  It may not be specific to Dom-Etoposide. Please read with care.</b></p><p>A nurse or other trained health professional will give you this medicine in a hospital or cancer treatment center. This medicine is given through a needle placed in one of your veins. The medicine must be injected slowly, so your IV tube will need to stay in place for 30 to 60 minutes.</p><p>Etoposide is sometimes given together with certain other medicines. If you are using a combination of medicines, make sure that you take each one at the proper time and do not mix them. If you are taking some of these medicines by mouth, ask your doctor to help you plan a way to remember to take your medicines at the right times.</p><p>Etoposide often causes nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite, which may be severe. However, it is very important that you continue to receive the medicine, even if you begin to feel ill. Ask your doctor for ways to lessen these effects.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using Dom-Etoposide</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>Using this medicine while you are pregnant can harm your unborn baby.

Men using this medicine should use condoms as a form of birth control during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of etoposide. A man intending to father a child should stop using this medicine and check with his doctor right away.</p><p>Etoposide can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of your getting an infection. It can also lower the number of platelets, which are necessary for proper blood clotting. If this occurs, there are certain precautions you can take, especially when your blood count is low, to reduce the risk of infection or bleeding:</p><ul>
<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or have painful or difficult urination.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor immediately if you notice any unusual bleeding or bruising, black, tarry stools, blood in the urine or stools, or pinpoint red spots on your skin.</li>
<li>Be careful when using a regular toothbrush, dental floss, or toothpick. Your medical doctor, dentist, or nurse may recommend other ways to clean your teeth and gums. Check with your medical doctor before having any dental work done.</li>
<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
</ul><p>This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.

Tell your doctor right away if you notice swelling, pain, or redness at the injection site.</p><p>This medicine may cause leukemia (cancer of the blood or bone marrow) in rare cases.
