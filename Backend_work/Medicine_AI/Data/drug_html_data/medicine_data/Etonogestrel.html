Insert implant subdermally just under the skin at the inner side of the nondominant upper arm overlying the triceps muscle ~8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and 3 to 5 cm (1.25 to 2 inches) posterior to the sulcus between the biceps and triceps muscles. This location is intended to avoid the large blood vessels and nerves lying within and surrounding the sulcus. If it is not possible to insert at this location (eg, in women with thin arms), insert as far posterior from the sulcus as possible. To ensure proper placement just under the skin, view advancement of the needle from the side, not from above the patient. Implant must be palpable after insertion. X-ray, CT scan, ultrasound scanning, or MRI may also be used to confirm the location of the implant if it is not palpable. Deeply placed implants should be localized and removed as soon as possible. Removal of deeply placed implants, implants that are not palpable, or implants that cannot be grasped during removal should be performed by health care providers trained in complex removal procedures. Use of a nonhormonal contraceptive (eg, condom) is required until the presence of the implant can be verified.</p><p>Perform removal under aseptic conditions. Inject local anesthetic under (not over) the implant. Confirm that the entire implant has been removed by measuring its length (4 cm). Remove all pieces if implant has broken. A new implant may be inserted in the same arm through the same incision as long as the site is in the correct location.</p><p>Refer to the manufacturer's product labeling for complete insertion, removal, and reinsertion instructions. A User Card (to give to the patient), consent form (to keep on file), and patient product information are provided with the device. Materials related to the insertion and removal of etonogestrel implant (including videos demonstrating insertion and removal) are available from the manufacturer (877-888-4231); www.nexplanontraining.com.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 25Â°C (77Â°F); excursions are permitted between 15Â°C and 30Â°C (59Â°F and 86Â°F).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Acitretin: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Progestins (Contraceptive).

Women with inherited thrombophilias (eg, protein C or S deficiency) may have increased risk of venous thromboembolism when using combination hormonal contraceptives (DeSancho 2010; van Vlijmen 2011). The risk of DVT/PE is expected to be less with progestin only contraceptives than that observed with combination hormonal contraceptives (Curtis 2016b). Use of etonogestrel is contraindicated in women with thrombosis or thromboembolic disorders (current or history of).</p><p>â€¢ Vaginal bleeding: Changes in bleeding patterns are likely to occur. Presentation of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding warrants further evaluation to rule out malignancy.</p><p>â€¢ Weight gain: Use commonly results in an average weight gain of ~2.8 pounds after 1 year and ~3.7 pounds after 2 years of treatment.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, diabetes, women who smoke) (Curtis 2016b)</p><p>â€¢ Diabetes: May impair glucose tolerance; use caution in women with diabetes or prediabetes.</p><p>â€¢ Diseases exacerbated by fluid retention: Use with caution in patients with diseases that may be exacerbated by fluid retention.</p><p>â€¢ Gallbladder disease: Use of combination hormonal contraceptives may have an increased risk of developing gallbladder disease; it is not known if this risk increases with progestin only products.</p><p>â€¢ Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas: Use of combination hormonal contraceptives is associated with hepatic adenomas (rare). The risk with progestin only contraceptives is not known. Etonogestrel is contraindicated with preexisting hepatic tumors.</p><p>â€¢ Hepatic impairment: May be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment. Discontinue if jaundice develops during therapy or if liver function becomes abnormal. Use is contraindicated in hepatic disease.</p><p>â€¢ Hyperlipidemia: Use caution in patients treated for hyperlipidemia; progestins may increase low-density lipoprotein concentrations.</p><p>â€¢ Hypertension: According to the manufacturer, women with a history of hypertension-related diseases should be encouraged to use a nonhormonal form of contraception. In women with hypertension that is well-controlled, use may be considered; monitor BP closely. If sustained hypertension develops during use, or if a significant increase in BP does not respond adequately to antihypertensive therapy, remove the implant. Women with adequately controlled hypertension may use progestin only implants; other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (such as older age, smoking, diabetes) should be considered when prescribing (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>â€¢ Renal impairment: Women with renal disease should be encouraged to use a nonhormonal form of contraception.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Contact lens wearers: Any changes with lens tolerance or vision should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.</p><p>â€¢ Obese: Lower etonogestrel serum concentrations are associated with increased BMI (Lazorwitz 2019). Use with caution in overweight women (may be less effective, especially in the presence of other risk factors such as concomitant enzyme inducers that may influence serum concentrations). Women &gt;130% of ideal body weight were not included in clinical studies. However, contraceptive failure was not observed in obese women in a prospective study (Xu 2012). Progestin-only implants may be used in women with a BMI â‰¥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>â€¢ Pediatric: Not for use prior to menarche.</p><p>â€¢ Surgical patients: Consider removal during periods of prolonged immobilization due to surgery or illness.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Implant: Broken or bent implants while in the patient's arm have been reported; the release rate of etonogestrel may be slightly increased. Ensure implant is removed in its entirety.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>â€¢ Appropriate use: For use in women who request long-acting (up to 3 years) contraception. Improper insertion may lead to unintended pregnancy. Insertion/removal should be done by a trained health care provider and implant must be palpable after insertion. Complications may occur from insertion and removal procedures including paraesthesia (due to neural injury), migration of the implant (due to IM or fascial insertion), and intravascular insertion. Cases in which the implant migrated within the pulmonary artery have been asymptomatic or associated with chest pain and/or respiratory disorders (eg, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis). Deeply placed implants should be localized and removed as soon as possible to prevent migration. Treatment should be instituted for infection at the insertion site; if infection persists, the implant should be removed. Expulsion may occur following incomplete insertion or infection. The implant must be removed by the end of the third year.</p><p>â€¢ Cervical cancer: The use of combination hormonal contraceptives has been associated with a slight increased risk of cervical cancer; however, studies are not consistent and may be related to additional risk factors (Gierisch 2013). Women awaiting treatment for cervical or ovarian cancer may use progestin only contraceptives (Curtis 2016b).</p><p>â€¢ HIV infection protection: Use does not protect against HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases (Curtis 2016a; Curtis 2016b).</p><p>â€¢ Laboratory changes: The use of estrogens and/or progestins may change the results of some laboratory tests (eg, coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, binding proteins). The dose, route, and the specific estrogen/progestin influences these changes. In addition, personal risk factors (eg, cardiovascular disease, smoking, diabetes, age) also contribute to adverse events; use of specific products may be contraindicated in women with certain risk factors.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Assessment of pregnancy status (prior to therapy); weight (optional; body mass index [BMI] at baseline may be helpful to monitor changes during therapy); assess potential health status changes at routine visits (Curtis 2016a).</p><p>Monitor patient for vision changes; BP; signs and symptoms of thromboembolic disorders; signs or symptoms of depression; glycemic control in patients with prediabetes or diabetes; lipid profiles in patients being treated for hyperlipidemias. Bleeding irregularities including amenorrhea; adequate diagnostic measures should be performed to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding.</p><h2>Reproductive Considerations</h2><p>Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use.</p><p>Due to the risk of thromboembolism associated with pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period, the manufacturer does not recommend insertion &lt;21 days' postpartum. However, available guidelines state that progestin-only implants may be inserted at any time if it is reasonably certain the woman is not pregnant, including immediately postpartum or post abortion (Curtis 2016a). Administration immediately postpartum (prior to hospital discharge) may be offered regardless of breastfeeding status and may help prevent rapid repeat and unintended pregnancies (ACOG 186 2017).</p><p>Etonogestrel serum concentrations decrease by 1 week after removal of the implant; pregnancies have been reported as early as 7 to 14 days after removal. Restart contraception immediately after removal if continued contraception is desired.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Use is contraindicated in pregnant women.</p><p>Etonogestrel is used to prevent pregnancy; the implant should be removed if pregnancy occurs. In general, the use of combination hormonal contraceptives, when inadvertently used early in pregnancy, have not been associated with teratogenic effects. There is no evidence that the risk is different with etonogestrel.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>â€¢ It is used to prevent pregnancy.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
