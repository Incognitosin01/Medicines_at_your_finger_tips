See individual agents.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (2%), oral candidiasis (3%)</p><p>Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection (3%)</p><p>Infection: Influenza (3%)</p><p>Nervous system: Voice disorder (3%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Back pain (3%), muscle spasm (3%)</p><p>Ophthalmic: Cataract (≤1%)</p><p>Respiratory: Cough (3%), pneumonia (2% to 5%), sinusitis (3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6%)</p><p>Frequency not defined: Respiratory: Paradoxical bronchospasm</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><i><b>Concerns related to adverse effects:</b></i></p><p>• Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving &gt;20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do <b>not</b> provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, or infections. Do not use this product to transfer patients from oral corticosteroid therapy.</p><p>• Asthma-related deaths: The use of long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) as monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related deaths (SMART [Nelson 2006]; Walters 2007); additional data from other clinical trials suggest risk of asthma-related hospitalization may also be increased with LABA monotherapy in pediatric and adolescent patients. However, data from large, randomized, double-blind controlled trials do not show a significant increase in risk of serious asthma-related events (including hospitalizations, intubations, and death) in adults, adolescents, and pediatric patients (4 to 11 years of age) when fixed-dose LABAs are used with inhaled corticosteroids combined in a single inhaler compared with inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy (FDA 2017). Current guidelines recommend the use of an as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid with formoterol for patients with infrequent symptoms (GINA 2020). No data exist associating LABA use with an increased risk of death in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p>• Bronchospasm: Rarely, paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with use of inhaled bronchodilating agents and may be life-threatening; this should be distinguished from inadequate response. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue and institute alternative therapy.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, urticaria, angioedema, rash) have been reported; discontinue if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs and institute alternative therapy.</p><p>• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Avoid use, if possible, in patients with ocular herpes; active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; or untreated viral, fungal, or bacterial or parasitic systemic infections. Exposure to chickenpox or measles should be avoided; if the patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin or pooled IV immunoglobulin may be indicated; if chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If exposure to measles occurs, prophylaxis with pooled IM immunoglobulin may be indicated.</p><p>• Lower respiratory infections: Pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections have been reported in patients with COPD following the use of inhaled corticosteroids; monitor COPD patients closely since pneumonia symptoms may overlap symptoms of exacerbations.</p><p>• Oral candidiasis: Local oropharyngeal <i>Candida</i> infections may occur; treat appropriately while either continuing or interrupting (if necessary) therapy.</p><p>• Serious effects/fatalities: Do not exceed recommended dose; serious adverse events, including fatalities, have been associated with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetics.</p><p><i><b>Disease-related concerns:</b></i></p><p>• Bone mineral density: Use with caution in patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (eg, anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids); long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density.</p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, especially coronary insufficiency, arrhythmias, and hypertension; beta-agonists may cause elevation in BP, heart rate, and increase risk of arrhythmias (eg, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles); may also cause ECG changes (eg, flattening of the T wave, QTc prolongation, ST segment depression).</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; beta-2 agonists may increase serum glucose and aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Budesonide and formoterol exposure may be increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment; use with caution in patients with severe impairment and monitor closely.</p><p>• Hypokalemia: Use with caution in patients with hypokalemia; beta-2 agonists may decrease serum potassium (effect is usually transient).</p><p>• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure, cataracts, and/or glaucoma; increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use of inhaled corticosteroids. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.</p><p>• Prostatic hyperplasia/bladder neck obstruction: Glycopyrrolate may worsen the symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia and/or bladder neck obstruction (eg, painful urination, difficulty passing urine); use with caution.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; systemic exposure to glycopyrrolate may be increased.</p><p>• Seizure disorders: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders.</p><p>• Thyrotoxicosis: Use with caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis.</p><p><i><b>Concurrent drug therapy issues: </b></i></p><p>• Drug-drug interactions: Potentially significant interactions may exist, requiring dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy. Consult drug interactions database for more detailed information.</p><p><i><b>Other warnings/precautions:</b></i></p><p>• Appropriate use: Do not use for acute episodes of COPD. Do not initiate in patients with significantly worsening, potentially life-threatening, or acutely deteriorating COPD. Do not exceed the recommended dose. After initiation of therapy, patients should use short-acting bronchodilators only on an as needed basis for acute symptoms.</p><p>• Discontinuation of systemic corticosteroids: Withdraw systemic corticosteroid therapy with gradual tapering of dose (eg, patients on prednisone may decrease dose by 2.5 mg weekly during inhaled corticosteroid therapy). Monitor lung function, beta-agonist use, and COPD symptoms, and for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (eg, fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, hypotension) during withdrawal.</p><p>• Transfer to oral inhaler: When transferring to oral inhaler, previously suppressed allergic conditions (eg, arthritis, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, eosinophilic conditions) may be unmasked.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>FEV<sub>1</sub>, peak flow, and/or other pulmonary function tests; bone mineral density; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression; BP, heart rate; serum potassium; serum glucose; ocular changes; signs/symptoms of oral or systemic infection.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Refer to individual monographs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).</p><p>• This drug is not to be used to treat intense flare-ups of shortness of breath.
