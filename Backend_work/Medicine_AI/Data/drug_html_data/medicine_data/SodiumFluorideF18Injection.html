</ul><h3>Recommended Dose for Adults</h3><p class="First">Administer 300–450 MBq (8–12 mCi) as an intravenous injection.</p><h3>Recommended Dose for Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">In reported clinical experience in approximately 100 children, weight based doses (2.1 MBq/kg) ranging from 19 MBq– 148 MBq (0.5 mCi- 4 mCi) were used.</p><h3>Radiation Dosimetry</h3><p class="First">The age/weight- based estimated absorbed radiation doses (mGy/MBq) from intravenous injection of Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection are shown in Table 1. These estimates were calculated based on human data and using the data published by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission [1] and the International Commission on Radiological Protection for Sodium Fluoride Injection [2]. The bone, bone marrow and urinary bladder are considered target and critical organs.</p><p>[1] Data from Nuclear Regulatory Commission Report, <span class="Italics">Radiation Dose Estimates for Radiopharmaceuticals,</span> NUREG/CR-6345, page 10, 1996.</p><p>[2] Data from ICRP publication 53, <span class="Italics">Radiation Dose to Patients from Radiopharmaceuticals</span> , Ann ICRP, Volume 18, pages 15 and 74, 1987</p><h3>Imaging Guidelines</h3><ul>
<li>Imaging of Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection can begin 1–2 hours after administration; optimally at 1 hour post administration.</li>
<li>Encourage the patient to void immediately prior to imaging the fluoride F18 radioactivity in the lumbar spine or bony pelvis.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Multiple-dose vial containing 370–7,400 MBq/mL (10–200 mCi/mL) at EOS reference time of no-carrier-added sodium fluoride F18 in aqueous 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is a clear, colorless, sterile, pyrogen-free and preservative-free solution for intravenous administration.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Allergic Reacions</h3><p class="First">As with any injectable drug product, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis may occur. Emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel should be immediately available.</p><h3>Cancer risk</h3><p class="First">Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection may increase the risk of cancer. Use the smallest dose necessary for imaging and ensure safe handling to protect the patient and health care worker.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">No adverse reactions have been reported for Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection based on a review of the published literature, publicly available reference sources, and adverse drug reaction reporting systems. However, the completeness of these sources is not known.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">The possibility of interactions of Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection with other drugs taken by patients undergoing PET imaging has not been studied.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C</span></p><p>Any radiopharmaceutical including Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection has a potential to cause fetal harm. The likelihood of fetal harm depends on the stage of fetal development, and the radionuclide dose. Animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection. Prior to the administration of Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection to women of childbearing potential, assess for presence of pregnancy. Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is excreted into human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to interrupt nursing after administration of Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection or not to administer Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. The body of scientific information related to radioactivity decay, drug tissue distribution and drug elimination shows that less than 0.01% of the radioactivity administered remains in the body after 24 hours (10 half-lives). To minimize the risks to a nursing infant, interrupt nursing for at least 24 hours.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">In reported clinical experience in approximately 100 children, weight based doses (2.1 MBq/kg) ranging from 19 MBq–148 MBq (0.5 mCi - 4 mCi) were used. Sodium Fluoride F18 was shown to localize to areas of bone turnover including rapidly growing epiphyses in developing long bones. Children are more sensitive to radiation and may be at higher risk of cancer from Sodium Fluoride F18 injection.</p><h2>Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection Description</h2><h3>Chemical Characteristics</h3><p class="First">Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical, containing no-carrier-added, radioactive fluoride F18 that is used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with PET imaging. It is administered by intravenous injection. The active ingredient, sodium fluoride F18, has the molecular formula Na[ <span class="Sup">18</span>F] with a molecular weight of 40.99, and has the following chemical structure:</p><p>Na <span class="Sup">+</span><span class="Sup">18</span>F <span class="Sup">-</span></p><p>Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is provided as a ready-to-use, isotonic, sterile, pyrogen-free, preservative-free, clear and colorless solution. Each mL of the solution contains between 370-7,400 MBq (10-200 mCi) sodium fluoride F18, at the EOS reference time, in 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride. The pH of the solution is between 4.5 and 8. The solution is presented in 30 mL multiple- dose glass vials with variable total volume and total radioactivity in each vial.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><p class="First">Fluoride F18 decays by positron (β+) emission and has a half-life of 109.7 minutes. Ninety-seven percent of the decay results in emission of a positron with a maximum energy of 633 keV and 3% of the decay results in electron capture with subsequent emission of characteristic X-rays of oxygen. The principal photons useful for diagnostic imaging are the 511 keV gamma photons, resulting from the interaction of the emitted positron with an electron (Table 2). Fluorine F18 atom decays to stable <span class="Sup">18</span>O-oxygen.</p><p>The specific gamma ray constant for fluoride F18 is 5.7 R/hr/mCi (1.35 x 10 <span class="Sup">-6</span> Gy/hr/kBq) at 1 cm. The half-value layer (HVL) for the 511 keV photons is 4.1 mm lead (Pb). A range of values for the attenuation of radiation results from the interposition of various thickness of Pb. The range of attenuation coefficients for this radionuclide is shown in Table 3. For example, the interposition of an 8.3 mm thickness of Pb with a coefficient of attenuation of 0.25 will decrease the external radiation by 75%.</p><p>Table 4 lists the fraction of radioactivity remaining at selected time intervals from the calibration time. This information may be used to correct for physical decay of the radionuclide.</p><h2>Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Fluoride F18 ion normally accumulates in the skeleton in an even fashion, with greater deposition in the axial skeleton (e.g. vertebrae and pelvis) than in the appendicular skeleton and greater deposition in the bones around joints than in the shafts of long bones.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Increased fluoride F18 ion deposition in bone can occur in areas of increased osteogenic activity during growth, infection, malignancy (primary or metastatic) following trauma, or inflammation of bone.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">After intravenous administration, fluoride F18 ion is rapidly cleared from the plasma in a biexponential manner. The first phase has a half-life of 0.4 h, and the second phase has a half-life of 2.6 h. Essentially all the fluoride F18 that is delivered to bone by the blood is retained in the bone. One hour after administration of fluoride F18 only about 10% of the injected dose remains in the blood. Fluoride F18 diffuses through capillaries into bone extracellular fluid space, where it becomes bound by chemisorption at the surface of bone crystals, preferentially at sites of newly mineralizing bone.</p><p>Deposition of fluoride F18 in bone appears to be primarily a function of blood flow to the bone and the efficiency of the bone in extracting the fluoride F18. Fluoride F18 does not appear to be bound to serum proteins.</p><p>In patients with normal renal function, 20% or more of the fluorine ion is cleared from the body in the urine within the first 2 hours after intravenous administration.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">Studies to assess reproductive toxicity, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis potential of Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection have not been performed.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Metastatic Bone Disease</h3><p class="First">The doses used in reported studies ranged from 2.7 mCi to 20 mCi (100 MBq to 740 MBq), with an average median dose of 10 mCi (370 MBq) and an average mean dose of 9.2 mCi (340 MBq). In PET imaging of bone metastases with Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection, focally increased tracer uptake is seen in both osteolytic and osteoblastic bone lesions. Negative PET imaging results with Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection do not preclude the diagnosis of bone metastases. Also, as benign bone lesions are also detected by Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection, positive PET imaging results cannot replace biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of cancer.</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><h2>HOW SUPPLIED / STORAGE AND HANDLING</h2><p class="First">Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is supplied in a multiple-dose Type I glass vial with elastomeric stopper and aluminum crimp seal containing between 370-7,400 MBq/mL (10-200 mCi/mL) of no-carrier-added sodium fluoride F18, at the EOS reference time, in aqueous 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
