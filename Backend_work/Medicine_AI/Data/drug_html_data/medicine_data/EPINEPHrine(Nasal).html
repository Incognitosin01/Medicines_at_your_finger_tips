Protection from light is recommended. Oxidation turns drug pink, then a brown color. <b>Solutions should not be used if they are discolored or contain a precipitate.</b></p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>Alpha1-Blockers: May diminish the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Similarly, Alpha-/Beta-Agonists may antagonize Alpha1-Blocker vasodilation.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>AtoMOXetine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. AtoMOXetine may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Beta-Blockers (Beta1 Selective): May diminish the therapeutic effect of EPINEPHrine (Nasal).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Beta-Blockers (Nonselective): May enhance the hypertensive effect of EPINEPHrine (Nasal).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Beta-Blockers (with Alpha-Blocking Properties): May diminish the therapeutic effect of EPINEPHrine (Nasal).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cannabinoid-Containing Products: May enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Chloroprocaine: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Cocaine (Topical): May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Consider alternatives to use of this combination when possible. Monitor closely for substantially increased blood pressure or heart rate and for any evidence of myocardial ischemia with concurrent use.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>COMT Inhibitors: May increase the serum concentration of COMT Substrates.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Doxofylline: Sympathomimetics may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Doxofylline. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Ergot Derivatives: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Ergot Derivatives may enhance the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists.<i> Avoid combination</i></p><p>Guanethidine: May enhance the arrhythmogenic effect of Sympathomimetics. Guanethidine may enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Inhalational Anesthetics: May enhance the arrhythmogenic effect of EPINEPHrine (Nasal).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Linezolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Reduce initial doses of sympathomimetic agents, and closely monitor for enhanced pressor response, in patients receiving linezolid.  Specific dose adjustment recommendations are not presently available.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: May enhance the hypertensive effect of EPINEPHrine (Nasal).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Ozanimod: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Management: Concomitant use of ozanimod with sympathomimetic agents is not recommended. If combined, monitor patients closely for the development of hypertension, including hypertensive crises.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Promethazine: May diminish the vasoconstricting effect of EPINEPHrine (Nasal).<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors: May enhance the tachycardic effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Serotonin/Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors may enhance the vasopressor effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Management: If possible, avoid coadministration of direct-acting alpha-/beta-agonists and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. If coadministered, monitor for increased sympathomimetic effects (eg, increased blood pressure, chest pain, headache).<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Solriamfetol: Sympathomimetics may enhance the hypertensive effect of Solriamfetol. Sympathomimetics may enhance the tachycardic effect of Solriamfetol. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Spironolactone: May diminish the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Sympathomimetics: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tedizolid: May enhance the hypertensive effect of Sympathomimetics. Tedizolid may enhance the tachycardic effect of Sympathomimetics.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Tricyclic Antidepressants: May enhance the vasopressor effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists. Management: Avoid, if possible, the use of alpha-/beta-agonists in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants. If combined, monitor for evidence of increased pressor effects and consider reductions in initial dosages of the alpha-/beta-agonist.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>Frequency not defined.</p><p>Cardiovascular: Angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, chest pain, flushing, hypertension, palpitations, tachycardia (parenteral administration), vasoconstriction, ventricular ectopy</p><p>Central nervous system: Anxiety (transient), apprehension, cerebral hemorrhage, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness</p><p>Dermatologic: Diaphoresis, pallor</p><p>Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, xerostomia</p><p>Genitourinary: Acute urinary retention (patients with bladder outflow obstruction)</p><p>Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reaction (eyelid)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Tremor, weakness</p><p>Ophthalmic: Angle-closure glaucoma (precipitation or exacerbation), burning sensation of eyes, eye irritation, eye pain, stinging of eyes (transient)</p><p>Respiratory: Dry throat, dyspnea, pulmonary edema</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular diseases (eg, coronary artery disease, hypertension).</p><p>• Cerebrovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cerebrovascular disease.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; may transiently increase blood glucose levels.</p><p>• Parkinson's disease: Use with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease; may cause temporary worsening of symptoms.</p><p>• Thyroid disease: Use with caution in patients with thyroid disease.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Tricyclic antidepressants: Use with caution in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants; effects of epinephrine may be potentiated.</p><p><b><i>Special populations:</i></b></p><p>• Elderly: Use with caution in the elderly.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Refer to the EPINEPHrine (Systemic) monograph.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat nose stuffiness.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
