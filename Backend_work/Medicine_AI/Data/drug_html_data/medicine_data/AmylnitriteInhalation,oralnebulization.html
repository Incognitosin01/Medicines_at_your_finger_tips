It works by relaxing blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.</p><p>Amyl nitrite may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Amyl nitrite comes in a glass capsule covered by a protective cloth. The cloth covering allows you to crush the glass capsule between your fingers without cutting yourself.</p><p>On the street, amyl nitrite and others like it are sometimes called "poppers." They have been used by some people to cause a "high" or to improve sex. Use in this way is not recommended. Amyl nitrite can cause serious harmful effects if too much is inhaled.</p><p>Amyl nitrite is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using amyl nitrite</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For amyl nitrite, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to amyl nitrite or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Studies on amyl nitrite have been done only in adult patients and there is no specific information comparing use of amyl nitrite in children with use in other age groups.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Dizziness or lightheadedness may be more likely to occur in the elderly, who are usually more sensitive to the effects of amyl nitrite.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking amyl nitrite, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using amyl nitrite with any of the following medicines is not recommended.

<li>Tadalafil</li>
<li>Vardenafil</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of amyl nitrite. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>

</ul><ul>

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of amyl nitrite</h2><p>To use amyl nitrite:</p><ul>
<li>When you begin to feel an attack of angina starting (chest pains or a tightness or squeezing in the chest), sit down. Then crush the cloth-covered glass capsule containing amyl nitrite between your finger and thumb. Pass it back and forth close to your nose and inhale the vapor several (1 to 6) times. Since you may become dizzy, lightheaded, or faint soon after using amyl nitrite, it is best to sit or lie down rather than stand while the medicine is working. If you become dizzy or faint while sitting, take several deep breaths of air and either bend forward with your head between your knees or lie down with your feet elevated.</li>
<li>Remain calm and you should feel better in a few minutes.</li>
</ul><p>Use amyl nitrite exactly as directed by your doctor , and do not use more than your doctor ordered. Using too much amyl nitrite may cause a dangerous overdose. If the medicine does not seem to be working as well after you have used it for a while, check with your doctor. Do not increase the dose on your own.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of amyl nitrite will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of amyl nitrite. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>
<li>For inhalation dosage form:
<ul>
<li>Adults: 0.3 milliliter (1 ampul) taken by inhaling the vapor of amyl nitrite through the nose. Dose may be repeated within 1 to 5 minutes if pain is not relieved. If you still have chest pain after a total of 2 doses in a 10-minute period, contact your doctor or have someone take you to a hospital emergency room without delay.</li>

When sildenafil is taken with amyl nitrite, the combination can lower blood pressure and cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. In some cases, sildenafil taken with the related nitrates has caused death.</p><p>Amyl nitrite is extremely flammable. Keep it away from heat or any open flame, especially when crushing the capsule. Amyl nitrite can catch fire very easily and cause serious burns.</p><p>Dizziness or lightheadedness may occur, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help, but if the problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.</p><p>Drinking alcohol while you are taking amyl nitrite may make the dizziness or lightheadedness worse and may cause a serious drop in blood pressure. Check with your doctor before drinking alcoholic beverages.</p><p>After using a dose of amyl nitrite, you may get a mild headache that lasts for a short time. This is a common side effect and is no cause for alarm. However, if this effect continues, or if the headaches are severe, check with your doctor.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Amyl nitrite side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
