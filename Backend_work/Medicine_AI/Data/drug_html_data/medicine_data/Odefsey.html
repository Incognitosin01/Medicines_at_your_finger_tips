Emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir are antiviral medicines that prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from multiplying in your body. HIV-1 is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).</p><p>Odefsey is a prescription medicine that is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) in people who have never taken HIV medicines before. This medicine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.</p><p>Odefsey is for use in adults and children who are at least 12 years old.</p><p>Odefsey should not be taken together with other antiviral medications to treat HIV or AIDS.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>There are many other drugs that can make Odefsey less effective and should not be used at the same time.

Talk with your doctor about your risk.</p><p>HIV can be passed to your baby if you are not properly treated during pregnancy. Take all of your HIV medicines as directed to control your infection. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant during treatment. If you are pregnant, your name may be listed on a pregnancy registry. This is to track the outcome of the pregnancy and to evaluate any effects of the medicine on the baby.</p><p>Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast-feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk.</p><p>Odefsey is not approved for use by anyone younger than 12 years old or weighing less than 77 pounds (35 kilograms).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How should I take Odefsey?</h2><p>Take Odefsey exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.</p><p>Take Odefsey one time per day with a meal. Do not miss a dose.</p><p>If a child is using this medicine, tell your doctor if the child has any changes in weight. Doses are based on weight in children, and any changes may affect your child's dose.</p><p>While using Odefsey, you may need frequent blood tests. Your bone density may also need to be tested.</p><p>If you have hepatitis B you may develop liver symptoms after you stop taking this medication, even months after stopping. Your doctor may want to check your liver function for several months after you stop using this medicine.</p><p>HIV/AIDS is usually treated with a combination of drugs. Use all medications as directed by your doctor. Read the medication guide or patient instructions provided with each medication. Do not change your doses or medication schedule without your doctor's advice. Every person with HIV or AIDS should remain under the care of a doctor.</p><p>When your Odefsey supply starts to run low, get more from your healthcare provider or pharmacy. This is very important because the amount of virus in your blood may increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may develop resistance to Odefsey and become harder to treat.</p><p>Store Odefsey in its original container at room temperature (below 86 °F (30 °C)). Keep away from moisture and heat. Keep the container tightly closed.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Be sure to take the medicine with a meal. If you are more than 12 hours late, skip the missed dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What to avoid</h2><p>Taking Odefsey will not prevent you from passing HIV to other people. Do not have unprotected sex or share razors or toothbrushes. Talk with your doctor about safe ways to prevent HIV transmission during sex. Sharing drug or medicine needles is never safe, even for a healthy person.</p><p>If you also take an antacid, take it at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after taking Odefsey. If you also take a heartburn or GERD medicine (such as Tagamet, Pepcid, Zantac), take it at least 12 hours before or 4 hours after taking Odefsey.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Odefsey side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction to Odefsey:</b> hives, blistering skin rash with fever; mouth sores, eye redness; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Some people develop lactic acidosis while taking HIV medication. Early symptoms may get worse over time and this condition can be fatal. Get emergency medical help if you have even mild symptoms such as: muscle pain or weakness, numb or cold feeling in your arms and legs, trouble breathing, stomach pain, nausea with vomiting, fast or uneven heart rate, dizziness, or feeling very weak or tired.</p><p>Call your doctor at once if you have:</p><ul>
