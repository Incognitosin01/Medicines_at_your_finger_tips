Assess each patientâ€™s risk before prescribing, and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions.Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products.Life-Threatening Respiratory DepressionSerious, life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow morphine sulfate whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose of morphine.Accidental IngestionAccidental ingestion of morphine sulfate, especially in children, can result in fatal overdose of morphine.Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal SyndromeProlonged use of morphine sulfate during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS DepressantsConcomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>

</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Analgesic</p><p>Chemical Class: Opioid</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Roxanol-T</h2><p>Morphine <i>tablet</i> is used to relieve short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) moderate to severe pain. The <i>extended-release capsule</i> and <i>extended-release tablet</i> are used to treat pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. Morphine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain.</p><p>Morphine <i>extended-release capsules</i> and <i>extended-release tablets</i> should not be used if you need pain medicine for just a short time, such as when recovering from surgery. Do not use this medicine to relieve mild pain, or in situations when non-narcotic medication is effective. This medicine should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or "as needed".</p><p>When morphine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.</p><p>This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Roxanol-T</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of morphine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of morphine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related lung, liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving morphine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.</p><ul>
<li>Nalmefene</li>
<li>Naltrexone</li>
<li>Safinamide</li>

Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. This is especially important for elderly patients, who may be more sensitive to the effects of pain medicines. If too much of this medicine is taken for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence).</p><p>It is very important that you understand the rules of the Opioid Analgesic REMS program to prevent addiction, abuse, and misuse of morphine. This medicine should also come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p><i>AvinzaÂ®</i> is taken every 24 hours. <i>KadianÂ®</i> is taken every 12 or 24 hours at the same time each day. <i>Arymoâ„¢ ER</i>, <i>Morphabondâ„¢ ER</i>, and <i>MS ContinÂ®</i> is taken every 8 or 12 hours.</p><p>You may take this medicine with or without food.</p><p>Morphine <i>extended-release capsules</i> and <i>extended-release tablets</i> should only be used by patients who have already been taking narcotic pain medicines, also called opioids. These patients are called <i>opioid-tolerant</i>. If you are uncertain whether or not you are opioid-tolerant, check with your doctor before using this medicine.</p><p>Swallow the <i>extended-release capsules</i> and <i>extended-release tablets</i> whole. Do not crush, break, dissolve, or chew them. Do not use <i>extended-release tablets</i> that are broken.</p><p>If you cannot swallow the <i>extended-release capsule</i>, you may open it and pour the contents into a small amount of applesauce. Stir this mixture well and swallow it right away without chewing. Do not receive this medicine through a nasogastric tube.</p><p>While taking the <i>extended-release tablet</i>, part of the tablet may pass into your stool. This is normal and nothing to worry about.</p><p>Morphine <i>extended-release capsules or tablets</i> work differently from the regular morphine oral solution or tablets, even at the same dose. Do not switch from one brand or form to the other unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p>Measure the <i>oral liquid</i> with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.

CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using this medicine. <i>Check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using this medicine</i>.</p><p>This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help lessen this problem. Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness.</p><p>This medicine may make you dizzy, drowsy, confused, or disoriented. <i>Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how this medicine affects you</i>.</p><p>Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.</p><p>This medicine may cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.</p><p><i>If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks or longer, do not change your dose or suddenly stop using it without checking with your doctor</i>. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as abdominal or stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble sleeping.</p><p><i>Do not take too much of this medicine or take it more often than your doctor tells you to</i>. This can be life-threatening. <i>Symptoms of an overdose include: extreme dizziness or weakness, slow heartbeat or breathing, seizures, trouble breathing, and cold, clammy skin. Call your doctor right away if you notice these symptoms</i>.</p><p>Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine.</p><p>Using too much of this medicine may cause reduced infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect the serotonin levels in your body.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor.
