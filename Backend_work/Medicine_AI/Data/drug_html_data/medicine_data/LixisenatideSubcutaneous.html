</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of lixisenatide</h2><p>When you start using lixisenatide, it is very important that you check your blood sugar often, especially before and after meals and at bedtime. This will help lower the chance of having very low blood sugar.</p><p>Lixisenatide should come with a Medication Guide. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Lixisenatide is usually given within 1 hour before the first meal of the day.</p><p>You will be using lixisenatide at home. Your doctor will teach you how the injections are to be given. Be sure you understand exactly how the medicine is to be injected.</p><p>Lixisenatide is given as a shot under the skin of your stomach, thighs, or upper arm. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm at room temperature before you inject it. If the medicine in the pen has changed color, looks cloudy, or if you see particles in it, do not use it.</p><p>Lixisenatide also works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. Also, it is best to use the doses at the same time each day.</p><p>Never share medicine pens with others under any circumstances. It is not safe for one pen to be used for more than one person. Sharing needles or pens can result in transmission of infection.</p><p>Throw away used needles in a hard, closed container that the needles cannot poke through (puncture-resistant). Keep this container away from children and pets.</p><p><i>Follow carefully the special meal plan your doctor gave you</i>. This is the most important part of controlling your condition, and is necessary if the medicine is to work properly. Also, exercise regularly and test for sugar in your blood or urine as directed.</p><p>Take acetaminophen or antibiotics at least 1 hour before you inject lixisenatide.</p><p>Take birth control pills at least 1 hour before or 11 hours after you inject lixisenatide.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of lixisenatide will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of lixisenatide. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>Missed dose</h3><p>If you miss a dose of lixisenatide, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.</p><p>If you miss a dose, use it within 1 hour before your next meal.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Keep out of the reach of children.</p><p>Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.</p><p>Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.</p><p>Store your <i>new, unused</i> prefilled pen in the refrigerator, in the original carton, and protect it from light. Do not freeze lixisenatide, and do not use the medicine if it has been frozen. You may store the <i>opened</i> prefilled pen in the refrigerator, or at room temperature for up to 14 days.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using lixisenatide</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits</i> to make sure that lixisenatide is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>It is very important to carefully follow any instructions from your health care team about:</p><ul>
<li>Alcohol—Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Discuss this with your health care team.</li>
<li>Other medicines—Do not take other medicines during the time you are using lixisenatide unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems.</li>
<li>Counseling—Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Also, diabetic patients may need special counseling about diabetes medicine dosing changes that might occur because of lifestyle changes, such as changes in exercise and diet. Furthermore, counseling on contraception and pregnancy may be needed because of the problems that can occur during pregnancy in patients with diabetes.</li>
<li>Travel—Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Be prepared for an emergency as you would normally. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times.</li>
<li>In case of emergency—There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says that you have diabetes and a list of all of your medicines.</li>
</ul><p>Pancreatitis may occur while you are using lixisenatide. Tell your doctor right away if you have sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fever, or lightheadedness.</p><p>Lixisenatide may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, mouth, or throat while you are using lixisenatide.</p><p>Lixisenatide does not cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, low blood sugar can occur when you use lixisenatide with other medicines that can lower blood sugar, such as insulin, metformin, or a sulfonylurea. Low blood sugar also can occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting.</p><ul>
<li>Symptoms of low blood sugar include anxiety, behavior change similar to being drunk, blurred vision, cold sweats, confusion, cool, pale skin, difficulty with thinking, drowsiness, excessive hunger, a fast heartbeat, headache (continuing), nausea, nervousness, nightmares, restless sleep, shakiness, slurred speech, or unusual tiredness or weakness.</li>
<li>If symptoms of low blood sugar occur, eat glucose tablets or gel, corn syrup, honey, or sugar cubes, or drink fruit juice, non-diet soft drink, or sugar dissolved in water to relieve the symptoms. Also, check your blood for low blood sugar. Glucagon is used in emergency situations when severe symptoms such as seizures (convulsions) or unconsciousness occur. Have a glucagon kit available, along with a syringe and needle, and know how to use it. Members of your family also should know how to use it.</li>
</ul><p>Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) may occur if you do not take enough or skip a dose of your antidiabetic medicine, overeat or do not follow your meal plan, have a fever or infection, or do not exercise as much as usual.</p><ul>
<li>Symptoms of high blood sugar include blurred vision, drowsiness, dry mouth, flushed, dry skin, fruit-like breath odor, increased urination (frequency and amount), ketones in the urine, loss of appetite, stomachache, nausea, or vomiting, tiredness, troubled breathing (rapid and deep), unconsciousness, or unusual thirst.</li>
<li>If symptoms of high blood sugar occur, check your blood sugar level and then call your doctor for instructions.</li>
</ul><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Lixisenatide side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
