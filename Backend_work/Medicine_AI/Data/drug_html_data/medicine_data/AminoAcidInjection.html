Central or peripheral administration of nutrition is dependent upon osmolality of solution. Solutions with &gt;5% dextrose or osmolarity ≥900 mOsm/L must be infused via central venous catheter. Total parenteral nutrition must be administered via central venous access. May require use of inline filter (consult specific product labeling and/or individual institutional policies and procedures). Initiation and termination of nutritional fluids must be gradual to permit endogenous insulin release adjustment. Consult specific product labeling for maximum infusion rates.</p><p>Vesicant; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during IV infusion. Avoid extravasation.</p><p><b>Extravasation management:</b> If extravasation occurs, stop infusion immediately and disconnect (leave needle/cannula in place); gently aspirate extravasated solution (do <b>NOT</b> flush the line); initiate hyaluronidase antidote; remove needle/cannula; apply dry cold compresses (Hurst 2004; Reynolds 2014); elevate extremity.</p><p><i>Hyaluronidase:</i> Intradermal or SubQ: Inject a total of 1 to 1.7 mL (15 units/mL) as five separate 0.2 to 0.3 mL injections (using a 25-gauge needle) into area of extravasation at the leading edge in a clockwise manner (MacCara 1983; Reynolds 2014; Zenk 1981).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store intact (unopened) containers at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); avoid excessive heat; do not freeze.

Frequency not defined.</p><p>Cardiovascular: Phlebitis, thrombosis</p><p>Dermatologic: Erythema</p><p>Endocrine &amp; metabolic: Fluid and electrolyte disturbance</p><p>Genitourinary: Azotemia</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concerns related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Extravasation: Vesicant; ensure proper catheter or needle position prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation.</p><p>• Hepatobiliary effects: Hepatobiliary disorders (eg, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis) may occur in patients without liver disease and may lead to hepatic failure. Increase in blood ammonia levels and hyperammonemia may also occur. Consider discontinuation or dose reduction in patients who develop abnormal LFTs.</p><p>• Hyperammonemia: Asymptomatic hyperammonemia has been reported. Infants are especially at risk; monitor blood ammonia levels frequently in infants. Discontinue use with symptoms of hyperammonemia.</p><p>• Hyperglycemia or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient's utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death. Patients with underlying confusion and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Monitor blood glucose levels.</p><p>• Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions: Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported. Stop infusion immediately and treat patient accordingly if any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction develop.</p><p>• Infection: Patients requiring parenteral nutrition may be at high risk of infection, including sepsis, due to malnutrition, the underlying disease state, or catheters required for administration. Proper aseptic technique should be followed; monitor for signs of early infection. Diabetic patients are at a greater risk of developing catheter-related infections compared with nondiabetic patients (McMahon 1996). Consider antifungal prophylaxis in patients receiving parenteral nutrition in ICUs with high rates (&gt;5%) of invasive candidiasis (IDSA [Pappas 2016]).</p><p>• Parenteral nutrition–associated liver disease: Has been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time, especially preterm infants. Parenteral nutrition–associated liver disease may present as cholestasis or steatohepatitis. Consider discontinuation or dose reduction in patients who develop liver function test abnormalities.</p><p>• Refeeding syndrome: Refeeding severely undernourished patients may result in refeeding syndrome (eg, intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patient becomes anabolic); thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. Carefully monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase nutrient intakes, while avoiding overfeeding.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (eg, cardiac insufficiency due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, heart failure); these patients are susceptible to excessive fluid accumulation; dosage adjustments may be necessary. Consider concentrated total parenteral nutrition formula.</p><p>• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Monitor blood glucose levels and treat hyperglycemia to maintain optimum levels.</p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; may result in amino acid imbalances, hyperammonemia, prerenal azotemia, stupor, and coma; dosage adjustments may be necessary. Consider volume status in patients with hepatic failure, may require concentrated total parenteral nutrition formula.</p><p>• Pulmonary disorders: Use with caution in patients with pulmonary congestion; these patients are susceptible to excessive fluid accumulation.</p><p>• Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; may be at risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance; dosage adjustments may be necessary. Administration of amino acids in patients with impaired renal function may augment an increase in BUN. May contain aluminum, which may accumulate following prolonged administration in patients with renal impairment.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Ceftriaxone: Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium may occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing parenteral nutrition solutions in the same IV line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously via a Y-site with calcium-containing parenteral solutions. Concurrent use is contraindicated in neonates &lt;28 days receiving ceftriaxone. In patients ≥28 days, may administer sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Aluminum: The parenteral product may contain aluminum; toxic aluminum concentrations may be seen with high doses, prolonged use, or renal impairment. Premature neonates are at higher risk due to immature renal function and aluminum intake from other parenteral sources. Parenteral aluminum exposure of &gt;4 to 5 mcg/kg/day is associated with CNS and bone toxicity; tissue loading may occur at lower doses (Federal Register 2002). See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Precipitates: Periodically inspect solution, infusion set and catheter for precipitates. Pulmonary vascular precipitates causing pulmonary vascular emboli and pulmonary distress has been reported (some fatal). If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the infusion.</p><p>• Sulfites: Some products may contain sulfites as preservatives.</p><p><b><i>Other warning/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Administration: For central or peripheral IV administration; peripheral administration of nutrition is dependent upon osmolality of solution.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, renal and hepatic function, ammonia levels, blood count and coagulation parameters throughout treatment; serum lipids in patients maintained on fat-free parenteral nutrition; signs and symptoms of infection and frequent checks of the parenteral access device and insertion site for edema, redness and discharge; bone densitometry (upon initiation of long-term therapy); signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction; vitamin A status (in patients with chronic renal failure). Monitor infusion site.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Following administration, an increase of some amino acids is observed in the fetus (Ronzoni 1999; Ronzoni 2002).</p><p>Severe malnutrition during pregnancy is associated with congenital malformation, preterm delivery, low birth weight/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality. Parenteral nutrition should be considered when nutritional requirements cannot be met via oral or enteral intake during pregnancy. In women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, total parenteral nutrition should be used as a last option for any woman who cannot maintain her weight because of vomiting; enteral nutrition is preferred (ACOG 189 2018).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to give nutrition to the body.</p><p><b>WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug.
