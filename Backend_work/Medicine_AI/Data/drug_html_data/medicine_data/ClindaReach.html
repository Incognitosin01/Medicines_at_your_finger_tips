</ul><h2>ClindaReach Description</h2><p class="First">ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> (Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Solution USP 1%) Pledgets contain clindamycin phosphate, USP at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per milliliter. Each ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> pledget applicator contains approximately 1 mL of topical solution.</p><p>Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi-synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin.</p><p>The solution contains isopropyl alcohol 50% v/v, propylene glycol, purified water, and sodium hydroxide (to adjust the pH to between 4.0 - 7.0). The structural formula is represented below:</p><p>The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is Methyl 7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-(1-methyl-<span class="Italics">trans</span>-4-propyl-L-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamido)-1-thio-L-<span class="Italics">threo</span>-α-D-<span class="Italics">galacto</span>-octopyranoside 2-(dihydrogen phosphate).</p><h2>ClindaReach - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>, rapid <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin.</p><p>Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin. Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin.</p><p>Following multiple topical applications of clindamycin phosphate at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per mL in an isopropyl alcohol and water solution, very low levels of clindamycin are present in the serum (0–3 ng/mL) and less than 0.2% of the dose is recovered in urine as clindamycin.</p><p>Clindamycin activity has been demonstrated in comedones from acne patients. The mean concentration of antibiotic activity in extracted comedones after application of clindamycin phosphate topical solution for 4 weeks was 597 mcg/g of comedonal material (range 0–1490). Clindamycin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> inhibits all <span class="Italics">Propionibacterium acnes</span> cultures tested (MICs 0.4 mcg/mL). Free fatty acids on the skin surface have been decreased from approximately 14% to 2% following application of clindamycin.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for ClindaReach</h2><p class="First">ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated in the treatment of acne vulgaris. In view of the potential for diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, the physician should consider whether other agents are more appropriate (see <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS</span>and <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin, a history of regional enteritis or ulcerative colitis, or a history of antibiotic-associated colitis.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis which may result in patient death. Use of the topical formulation of clindamycin results in absorption of the antibiotic from the skin surface. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Endoscopic examination may reveal pseudomembranous colitis. <span class="Bold">Stool culture for <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span> and stool assay for <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> toxin may be helpful diagnostically</span>.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">When significant diarrhea occurs, the drug should be discontinued. Large bowel endoscopy should be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis in cases of severe diarrhea.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen the condition. Vancomycin has been found to be effective in the treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>. The usual adult dosage is 500 milligrams to 2 grams of vancomycin orally per day in three to four divided doses administered for 7 to 10 days. <span class="Bold">Cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind vancomycin <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>.</span> If both a resin and vancomycin are to be administered concurrently, it may be advisable to separate the time of administration of each drug.</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Diarrhea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis have been observed to begin up to several weeks following cessation of oral and parenteral therapy with clindamycin.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General -</span> ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> contains an alcohol base which will cause burning and irritation of the eye. In the event of accidental contact with sensitive surfaces (eye, abraded skin, mucous membranes), bathe with copious amounts of cool tap water. The solution has an unpleasant taste and caution should be exercised when applying medication around the mouth. ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals.</p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions -</span> Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B -</span> Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using subcutaneous and oral doses of clindamycin ranging from 100 to 600 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to clindamycin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers -</span> It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span>. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><p><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use -</span> Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established.</p><p><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use -</span> Clinical studies for clindamycin phosphate topical solution USP, 1% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In 18 clinical studies of various formulations of topical clindamycin phosphate using placebo vehicle and/or active comparator drugs as controls, patients experienced a number of treatment emergent adverse dermatologic events [see table below].</p><p class="First">Burning</p><p class="First">62    (11)</p><p class="First">15    (10)</p><p class="First">17    (11)</p><p class="First">Itching</p><p class="First">36    (7)</p><p class="First">15    (10)</p><p class="First">17    (11)</p><p class="First">Burning/Itching</p><p class="First">60    (11)</p><p class="First">#      ( – )</p><p class="First">#      ( – )</p><p class="First">Dryness</p><p class="First">105  (19)</p><p class="First">34    (23)</p><p class="First">29    (18)</p><p class="First">Erythema</p><p class="First">86    (16)</p><p class="First">10    (7)</p><p class="First">22    (14)</p><p class="First">Oiliness/Oily Skin</p><p class="First">8      (1)</p><p class="First">26    (18)</p><p class="First">12*   (10)</p><p class="First">Peeling</p><p class="First">61    (11)</p><p class="First">#      ( – )</p><p class="First">11     (7)</p><p>Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis which may end fatally. Cases of diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported as adverse reactions in patients treated with oral and parenteral formulations of clindamycin and rarely with topical clindamycin (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><p>Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal disturbances as well as gram-negative folliculitis have also been reported in association with the use of topical formulations of clindamycin.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Topically applied ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h2>ClindaReach Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Do not use if the seal on jar is broken. Remove pledget from jar just before use. Use a pledget to apply a thin film of ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> to the affected area twice daily. More than one pledget may be used. Each pledget should be used only once and then discarded. Keep jar tightly closed when not in use.</p><h2>How is ClindaReach Supplied</h2><p class="First">ClindaReach<span class="Sup">®</span> is available as:</p><p>A jar containing 60 single-use pledget applicators (NDC 65880-503-60)<br/>
