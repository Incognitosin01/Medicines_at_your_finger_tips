Use of properly diluted Hyperlyte® CR meets most adult daily electrolyte requirements and provides adjunctive therapy for replenishment of depleted electrolyte stores.</p><p>Sodium, the major cation of the extracellular fluid, functions primarily in the control of water distribution, fluid balance, and osmotic pressure of body fluids. Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid-base equilibrium of body fluid.</p><p>Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water) and is concerned with the maintenance of body fluid composition and electrolyte balance. Potassium participates in carbohydrate utilization and protein synthesis, and is critical in the regulation of nerve conduction and muscle contraction, particularly in the heart.</p><p>Chloride, the major extracellular anion, closely follows the metabolism of sodium, and changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration.</p><p>Calcium, an important cation, provides the framework of bones and teeth in the form of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. In the ionized form, calcium is essential for the functional mechanism of the clotting of blood, normal cardiac function, and regulation of neuromuscular irritability.</p><p>Magnesium, a principal cation of soft tissue, is primarily involved in enzyme activity associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates and protein. Magnesium is also involved in neuromuscular irritability.</p><p>Acetate is an organic ion which is a hydrogen ion acceptor, contributes bicarbonate during its metabolism to carbon dioxide and water, and serves as an alkalinizing agent.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Hyperlyte CR</h2><p class="First">Hyperlyte® CR is indicated for use as a supplement to parenteral nutritional solutions containing amino acids, dextrose and/or other calorie sources delivered by central venous or peripheral infusion, to facilitate amino acid utilization and maintain electrolyte balance in adults.</p><p>Hyperlyte® CR (Multi-Electrolyte Concentrate) is also indicated as a source of replacement electrolytes for the depleted adult patient during parenteral therapy.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Hyperlyte® CR is contraindicated in clinical conditions where the administration of potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, or chloride could be clinically detrimental.</p><p>Hyperlyte® CR is not intended for pediatric use.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Strongly hypertonic solution. Must be properly diluted and thoroughly mixed before injection.</span></p><p>WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.</p><p>Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.</p><p><span class="Bold">Contains no phosphate.</span> Patients receiving TPN solutions containing concentrated dextrose may also require phosphate in addition to Hyperlyte® CR.</p><p>Each 20 mL dose contains 20 mEq of potassium. Patient requirements should be carefully evaluated prior to the addition of any potassium salt to a solution containing Hyperlyte® CR.</p><p>Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema.</p><p>Solutions containing potassium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly in the presence of renal disease, and in such instances, cardiac monitoring is recommended.</p><p>In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention.</p><p>Solutions containing calcium ions should not be administered through the same administration set as blood because of the likelihood of coagulation.</p><p>Solutions containing acetate should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. The administration of acetate should be done with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of acetate, such as severe hepatic insufficiency.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><h3>General</h3><p class="First">Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the use of additional electrolyte supplements, or the use of electrolyte-free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added.</p><p>This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.</p><p>Blood levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and chloride should be monitored frequently during parenteral nutrition or intravenous therapy, and the daily dosage of electrolytes may require tailoring to meet individual needs. In tissue electrolyte depletion, addition of certain electrolytes may be required to meet individual patient needs.</p><p>Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.</p><p>Care must be exercised in administering solutions containing up to 30 mEq of sodium and 40 mEq of potassium per liter to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.</p><p>Potassium therapy should be guided by serial electrocardiograms since plasma levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.</p><p>Solutions containing potassium, magnesium or calcium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease. Parenteral magnesium or calcium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.</p><p>Extraordinary electrolyte and fluid losses are not necessarily corrected by infusion of solutions containing Hyperlyte® CR. In order to avoid deficits, special consideration must be given to replacement of excessive fluid and electrolyte losses in such conditions as protracted vomiting or diarrhea, nasogastric suction, or fistula drainage.</p><p>If both phosphate and Hyperlyte® CR are to be added to the solution for TPN administration, add the Hyperlyte® CR to one container (either to the amino acids or the concentrated dextrose) and add the phosphate to the other to avoid physical incompatibilities between calcium and phosphorus.</p><p>Solutions containing acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.</p><p>If the administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result.</p><p>To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration and periodically during administration.</p><p>Use only if solution is clear and vacuum is present. Discard the container no later than 4 hours after initial closure puncture.</p><h3>Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Administration of barbiturates, narcotics, hypnotics or systemic anesthetics should be adjusted and used with caution in patients also receiving magnesium-containing solutions because of an additive central depressive effect.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">No <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> or <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or fertility studies have been conducted with Hyperlyte® CR (Multi-Electrolyte Concentrate).</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Hyperlyte® CR (Multi-Electrolyte Concentrate). It is also not known whether Hyperlyte® CR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyperlyte® CR should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Labor and Delivery</h3><p class="First">As reported in the literature, electrolyte containing solutions have been administered during labor and delivery. Caution should be exercised, and the fluid balance, glucose and electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance, of both mother and fetus should be evaluated periodically or whenever warranted by the condition of the patient or fetus.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when solutions containing electrolytes are administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric populations have not been established.</p><p>See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span> .</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p><p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><p>See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.</p><p>Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the final infusate. Therefore, frequent monitoring of blood electrolyte levels is essential.</p><p>Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water, resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume.</p><p>Reactions reported with the use of potassium-containing solutions include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea.</p><p>The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities, areflexia, muscular or respiratory paralysis, mental confusion, weakness, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiac arrest.</p><p>Potassium deficits result in disruption of neuromuscular functions, and intestinal ileus and dilatation.</p><p>If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.</p><p>Abnormally high plasma levels of calcium can result in depression, amnesia, headaches, drowsiness, disorientation, syncope, hallucinations, hypotonia of both skeletal and smooth muscles, dysphagia, arrhythmias and coma.</p><p>Calcium deficits can result in neuromuscular hyperexcitability, including cramps and convulsions.</p><p>Abnormally high plasma levels of magnesium can result in flushing, sweating, hypotension, circulatory collapse, and depression of cardiac and central nervous system function. Respiratory depression is the most immediate threat to life.</p><p>Magnesium deficits can result in tachycardia, hypertension, hyperirritability and psychotic behavior.</p><p>If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of a fluid or solute overload during parenteral therapy, reevaluate the patient’s condition and institute appropriate corrective treatment.</p><p>In the event of overdosage with potassium-containing solutions, discontinue the infusion immediately and institute corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels.</p><p>Treatment of hyperkalemia includes the following:</p><p class="First">Absorption and exchange of potassium using sodium or ammonium cycle cation exchange resin, orally and as retention enema.</p><p class="First">Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. The use of potassium-containing foods or medications must be eliminated. However, in cases of digitalization, too rapid a lowering of plasma potassium concentration can cause digitalis toxicity.</p><h2>Hyperlyte CR Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Not for direct patient injection.</span></p><p>Hyperlyte® CR (Multi-Electrolyte Concentrate) in Pharmacy Bulk Package is for prescription compounding of intravenous admixtures only.
