</ul><h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VitaPhil + DHA and VitaPhil + DHA 90</span> are indicated to provide vitamin/mineral and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation to women throughout pregnancy, during the postnatal period for both lactating and non-lactating mothers and throughout the child bearing years. <span class="Bold">VitaPhil + DHA and VitaPhil + DHA 90</span> are also useful in improving the nutritional status prior to conception.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</h2><p class="First">Before, during and after pregnancy, one caplet and one softgel capsule taken by mouth daily, or as prescribed by a physician. The caplet and softgel capsule may be taken together or at different times of the day. Caution should be exercised to ensure that the prescribed dose of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1,000 mg) per day.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">VitaPhil + DHA and VitaPhil + DHA 90</span> are contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients, including fish oil and soy. Iron is contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. These products are contraindicated for persons with pernicious anemia, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms.</p><h2>WARNING:</h2><p class="First">Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.</p><p>Ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids (including alpha-linolenic acid [ALA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] from fish oils) of more than 3 grams per day may present antithrombotic effects, including increased bleeding time. Omega-3 fatty acids including DHA and EPA should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diatheses. Patients taking anticoagulant drug products should consult with their physician prior to ingesting omega-3 fatty acids.<br/></p><h2>PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Folic acid in dosages above 400 mcg daily may obscure megaloblastic (pernicious) anemia in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations (Addisonian anemia) remain progressive.</p><h2>ADVERSE REACTIONS:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Iron:</span> Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation) can occur but are usually mild and can subside with continuation of therapy. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, <span class="Bold">VitaPhil + DHA and VitaPhil + DHA 90</span> when taken after meals, may control occasional G.I. disturbances. <span class="Bold">VitaPhil + DHA and VitaPhil + DHA 90</span> are best absorbed when taken at bedtime.<br/>
<span class="Bold">Folic Acid:</span> Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="Bold">Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

Acute overdosage of iron may cause nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, iron overdose can cause cardiovascular collapse and death. Other symptoms include pallor and cyanosis, melena, shock, drowsiness and coma. The estimated overdose of orally ingested iron is 300mg/kg body weight. When overdoses are ingested by children, severe reactions, including fatalities have resulted. <span class="Bold">VitaPhil + DHA and VitaPhil + DHA 90</span> should be stored beyond the reach of children to prevent against accidental iron poisoning. <span class="Bold">Keep this and all other drugs out of reach of children.</span> Treatment: For specific therapy, exchange transfusion and chelating agents should be used.
