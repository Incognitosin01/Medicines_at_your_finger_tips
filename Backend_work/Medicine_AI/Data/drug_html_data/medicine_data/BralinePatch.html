Lidocaine HCl is present in a 4% concentration (w/w). It is chemically designated as 2-(diethylamine)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl) acetamide and has an empirical formula C <span class="Sub">14</span>H <span class="Sub">22</span>N <span class="Sub">2</span>O.</p><p>The molecular weight of lidocaine HCl is 234.34 g/mol. Menthol is present in a 4% concentration (w/w). The chemical name (1R,2S,5R)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol. The empirical formulat is menthol is C <span class="Sub">10</span>H <span class="Sub">20</span>O with a molecular weight of 156.27 g/mol.</p><p>The structural formulas are:</p><p></p><h2>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:</h2><p class="First">Lidocaine is a topical anesthetic and stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action.</p><p>Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it also acts as a weak kappa (k) opioid receptor agonist. Menthol acts to chemically trigger the cold-sensitive TRPM-8 receptors in the skin-responsible for the well-known cooling sensation it stimulates when applied directly to the skin. Menthol's analgesic properties are not fully understood, however they are mediated through a selective activation of k-opioid receptors. Menthol also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscle tissue.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Italics">BRALINE</span> is a formulation used to assist patients in the treatment of mild to moderate acute or chronic aches or pain. Muscle or joint pain can be due to musculoligamentous strains, simple backache, tendonitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral neuropathies such as diabetic neuropathy or post herpetic neuralgia, and other complex regional pains. It can also be used to help with certain types of headaches, but use with caution when applying in order to avoid eye contact. If consulted by your physician, it may be used for other conditions as well.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h2><p class="First">Known hypersensitivity to menthol, lidocaine, or any of the topical amide-like anesthetic preparations.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Excessive dosage, or short interval between doses, can result in high plasma levels and serious adverse effects.
