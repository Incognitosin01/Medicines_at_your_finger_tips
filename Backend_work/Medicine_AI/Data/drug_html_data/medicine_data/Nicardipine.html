</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Cardiovascular Agent</p><p>Pharmacologic Class: Calcium Channel Blocker</p><p>Chemical Class: Dihydropyridine</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for nicardipine</h2><p>Nicardipine is used alone or together with other medicines to treat severe chest pain (angina) or high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .</p><p>Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker. It works by affecting the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, nicardipine relaxes blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload .</p><p>Nicardipine is available only with your doctor's prescription .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using nicardipine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For nicardipine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to nicardipine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of nicardipine in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established .</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nicardipine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems which may require an adjustment of dose in patients receiving nicardipine .</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking nicardipine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using nicardipine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.

The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of nicardipine.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of nicardipine</h2><p>In addition to the use of nicardipine, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and changes in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium. Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet .</p><p>Many patients who have high blood pressure will not notice any signs of the problem. In fact, many may feel normal. It is very important that you <i>take your medicine exactly as directed</i> and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well .</p><p>Remember that nicardipine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. You must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. <i>You may have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life.</i> If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, stroke, or kidney disease .</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of nicardipine will be different for different patients.
