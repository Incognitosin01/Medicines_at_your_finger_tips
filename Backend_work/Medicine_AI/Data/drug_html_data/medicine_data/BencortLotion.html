</ul><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE:</h2><h2>Bencort Lotion Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Shake well before use. Apply a thin film, 1 to<br/>
3 times daily, gently massaging into skin or as directed by a physician.<br/></p><h2>TO THE PHARMACIST</h2><p class="First">At the time of dispensing, add the contents of the<br/>
Bencort Benzoyl Peroxide Powder vial to the Bencort Lotion in the bottle.<br/>
Shake well to ensure uniform dispersion. Place expiration date of three (3) months on<br/>
the label. Bencort Lotion is 25 grams net weight.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Bencort Lotion is contraindicated in patients<br/>
hypersensitive to benzoyl peroxide, hydrocortisone, other corticosteroids or to any<br/>
ingredient contained in this product. Topical steroids are contraindicated in viral<br/>
diseases of the skin, such as varicella or vaccinia. Topical corticosteroids should not<br/>
be used in patients with markedly impaired circulation since skin ulceration has<br/>
occurred in these patients following use of the drugs.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><p class="First">Irritation including peeling, itching and/or redness<br/>
may occur, especially at the start of treatment. If any of these effects persist or worsen,<br/>
stop using and contact your doctor immediately. Smaller amounts of the drug may need to<br/>
be applied less often. Consult your doctor for instructions. For external use only. Keep away<br/>
from the eyes and mucous membranes. If severe irritation or swelling develops, discontinue<br/>
use and seek appropriate therapy.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most frequent adverse reactions to benzoyl peroxide<br/>
are irritation and contact dermatitis. Although 0.5% hydrocortisone is considered<br/>
safe, the following adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids,<br/>
especially under occlusive dressings: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis,<br/>
hypertrichosis, acneform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic<br/>
contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae,<br/>
miliaria.<br/></p><p>This is not a complete list of possible adverse effects. If you notice other effects not<br/>
listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.</p><p><span class="Bold">Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may<br/>
