When reconstituted as directed, the suspension provides the equivalent of 125 mg or 250 mg of cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil) per 5 mL.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">CEFTIN is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to CEFTIN or to other β-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins).</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Anaphylactic Reactions</h3><p class="First">Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on β-lactam antibacterials. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of β-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. CEFTIN is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to CEFTIN or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Before initiating therapy with CEFTIN, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue CEFTIN and institute appropriate therapy.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile-</span>associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including CEFTIN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Potential for Microbial Overgrowth</h3><p class="First">The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy.</p><h3>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing CEFTIN either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug‑resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">CEFTIN for oral suspension 125 mg/5 mL contains phenylalanine 11.8 mg per 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) of reconstituted suspension. CEFTIN for oral suspension 250 mg/5 mL contains phenylalanine 25.2 mg per 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) of reconstituted suspension.</p><h3>Interference with Glucose Tests</h3><p class="First">A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving CEFTIN <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.4)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious and otherwise important adverse reaction is described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label:</p><p>Anaphylactic Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions [5.1)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tablets</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Multiple</span>‑<span class="Italics">Dose Dosing Regimens with 7 to 10 Days’ Duration:</span> In multiple-dose clinical trials, 912 subjects were treated with CEFTIN (125 to 500 mg twice daily). It is noted that 125 mg twice daily is not an approved dosage. Twenty (2.2%) subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 subjects who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of subjects treated with CEFTIN who discontinued study drug because of adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions increased with the higher recommended doses.</p><p>The adverse reactions in Table 5 are for subjects (n = 912) treated with CEFTIN in multiple‑dose clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CEFTIN</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 912)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Blood and lymphatic system disorders</span></p><p class="First">Eosinophilia</p><p class="First">1%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal disorders</span></p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">4%</p><p class="First">Nausea/Vomiting</p><p class="First">3%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Investigations</span></p><p class="First">Transient elevation in AST</p><p class="First">2%</p><p class="First">Transient elevation in ALT</p><p class="First">2%</p><p class="First">Transient elevation in LDH</p><p class="First">1%</p><p>The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% but greater than 0.1% of subjects (n = 912) treated with CEFTIN in multiple-dose clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Italics">Early Lyme Disease with 20-Day Regimen:</span> Two multicenter trials assessed CEFTIN 500 mg twice daily for 20 days. The most common drug‑related adverse experiences were diarrhea (10.6%), Jarisch‑Herxheimer reaction (5.6%), and vaginitis (5.4%). Other adverse experiences occurred with frequencies comparable to those reported with 7 to 10 days’ dosing.</p><p><span class="Italics">Single</span>‑<span class="Italics">Dose Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonorrhea:</span> In clinical trials using a single 1,000-mg dose of CEFTIN, 1,061 subjects were treated for uncomplicated gonorrhea.</p><p>The adverse reactions in Table 6 were for subjects treated with a single dose of 1,000 mg CEFTIN in U.S. clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CEFTIN</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 1,061)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal disorders</span></p><p class="First">Nausea/Vomiting</p><p class="First">7%</p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">4%</p><p>The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% but greater than 0.1% of subjects (n = 1,061) treated with a single dose of CEFTIN 1,000 mg for uncomplicated gonorrhea in U.S. clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold">Oral Suspension</span></p><p>In clinical trials using multiple doses of CEFTIN, pediatric subjects (96.7% were younger than 12 years) were treated with CEFTIN (20 to 30 mg/kg/day divided twice daily up to a maximum dose of 500 or 1,000 mg/day, respectively). Eleven (1.2%) U.S. subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. The discontinuations were primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances, usually diarrhea or vomiting. Thirteen (1.4%) U.S. pediatric subjects discontinued therapy due to the taste and/or problems with drug administration.</p><p>The adverse reactions in Table 7 are for U.S. subjects (n = 931) treated with CEFTIN in multiple‑dose clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CEFTIN</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(n = 931)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal disorders</span></p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">9%</p><p class="First">Dislike of taste</p><p class="First">5%</p><p class="First">Nausea/vomiting</p><p class="First">3%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</span></p><p class="First">Diaper rash</p><p class="First">3%</p><p>The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% but greater than 0.1% of U.S. subjects (n = 931) treated with CEFTIN for oral suspension in multiple‑dose clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Italics">Infections and Infestations:</span> Gastrointestinal infection, candidiasis, viral illness, upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, urinary tract infection.</p><p><span class="Italics">Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders:</span> Eosinophilia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Psychiatric Disorders:</span> Hyperactivity, irritable behavior.</p><p><span class="Italics">Gastrointestinal Disorders:</span> Abdominal pain, flatulence, ptyalism.</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:</span> Rash.</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders:</span> Joint swelling, arthralgia.</p><p><span class="Italics">Reproductive System and Breast Disorders:</span> Vaginal irritation.</p><p><span class="Italics">General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:</span> Cough, fever.</p><p><span class="Italics">Investigations:</span> Elevated liver enzymes, positive Coombs’ test.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CEFTIN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders</span></p><p>Hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia.</p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Disorders</span></p><p>Pseudomembranous colitis <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Hepatobiliary Disorders</span></p><p>Hepatic impairment including hepatitis and cholestasis, jaundice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Immune System Disorders</span></p><p>Anaphylaxis, serum sickness‑like reaction.</p><p><span class="Bold">Investigations</span></p><p>Increased prothrombin time.</p><p><span class="Bold">Nervous System Disorders</span></p><p>Seizure, encephalopathy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal and Urinary Disorders</span></p><p>Renal dysfunction.</p><p><span class="Bold">Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders</span></p><p>Angioedema, erythema multiforme, Stevens‑Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Oral Contraceptives</h3><p class="First">Cefuroxime axetil may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Counsel patients to consider alternate supplementary (non-hormonal) contraceptive measures during treatment.</p><h3>Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity</h3><p class="First">Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of CEFTIN compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of CEFTIN when administered in the postprandial state. Administer CEFTIN at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H<span class="Sub">2</span>) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided.</p><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Coadministration of probenecid with cefuroxime axetil is not recommended.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">A false‑positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme‑based tests for glycosuria. As a false‑negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving cefuroxime axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Pregnancy Category B. There are no adequate and well‑controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, CEFTIN should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in mice at doses up to 3,200 mg/kg/day (14 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and in rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (9 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to cefuroxime axetil.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">Because cefuroxime is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when CEFTIN is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of CEFTIN have been established for pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years for acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis based upon its approval in adults. Use of CEFTIN in pediatric patients is supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data in adults and pediatric patients, and by clinical and microbiological data from adequate and well‑controlled trials of the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults and of acute otitis media with effusion in pediatric patients. It is also supported by postmarketing adverse events surveillance. <span class="Italics">[See Indications and Usage (1), Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects who received CEFTIN in 20 clinical trials, 375 were aged 65 and older while 151 were aged 75 and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Cefuroxime is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Reducing the dosage of CEFTIN is recommended for adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of cephalosporins can cause cerebral irritation leading to convulsions or encephalopathy. Serum levels of cefuroxime can be reduced by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.</p><h2>Ceftin Tablets, Oral Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">CEFTIN tablets and CEFTIN for oral suspension contain cefuroxime as cefuroxime axetil. CEFTIN is a semisynthetic, cephalosporin antibacterial drug for oral administration.</p><p>The chemical name of cefuroxime axetil (1‑(acetyloxy) ethyl ester of cefuroxime) is (<span class="Italics">RS</span>)-1-hydroxyethyl (6<span class="Italics">R</span>,7<span class="Italics">R</span>)-7-[2-(2-furyl)glyoxyl-amido]-3-(hydroxymethyl)-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]-oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate, 7<span class="Sup">2</span>-(<span class="Italics">Z</span>)-(<span class="Italics">O</span>-methyl-oxime), 1-acetate 3-carbamate.
