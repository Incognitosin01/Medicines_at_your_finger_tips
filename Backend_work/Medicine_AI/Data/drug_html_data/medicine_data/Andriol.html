Before initiating testosterone undecanoate, consider the patient’s baseline cardiovascular risk and ensure blood pressure is adequately controlled. Periodically monitor for and treat new-onset hypertension or exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension and re-evaluate whether the benefits of testosterone undecanoate outweigh its risks in patients who develop cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease on treatment. Due to this risk, use testosterone undecanoate only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies .</p><ul class="ddc-anchor-links"><li>Uses</li>
