Follow your doctor's instructions about what medications to use during an attack and how much time to allow between doses.</p><p>Follow all directions on your prescription label. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.

Place the tablet under your tongue and allow it to dissolve slowly. Do not chew or swallow it.</p><p>You may use the sublingual tablet within 15 minutes before an activity you think might cause chest pain. Follow your doctor's instructions.</p><p>Do not crush, chew, break, or open an <b>extended-release capsule or tablet</b>.
