</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Calcium Channel Blocker</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for levamlodipine</h2><p>Levamlodipine is used alone or together with other medicines to lower hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults and children. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.</p><p>Levamlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p><p>Levamlodipine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using levamlodipine</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For levamlodipine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to levamlodipine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of levamlodipine to lower blood pressure in children younger than 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of levamlodipine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving levamlodipine.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking levamlodipine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using levamlodipine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>
<li>Abametapir</li>
<li>Cyclosporine</li>
<li>Simvastatin</li>
<li>Tacrolimus</li>
</ul><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of levamlodipine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:</p><ul>
<li>Angina (chest pain) or</li>
<li>Heart attack, acute or</li>
<li>Heart or blood vessel disease (eg, coronary artery disease) or</li>
<li>Hypotension (low blood pressure)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.</li>

<li>Aortic stenosis (heart valve problem), severe or</li>
<li>Heart or blood vessel disease—Use with caution. May cause side effects to become worse.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of levamlodipine</h2><p><i>Take levamlodipine only as directed by your doctor</i>. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.</p><p>In addition to the use of levamlodipine, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and changes in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium (salt). Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet.</p><p>It is very important that you <i>take your medicine exactly as directed</i> and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well.</p><p>Remember that levamlodipine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. <i>You might have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life</i>. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, strokes, or kidney disease.</p><p>You may take levamlodipine with or without food. Take it at the same time each day.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of levamlodipine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label.

If you faint, call your doctor right away.</p><p>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may also occur if you exercise or if the weather is hot.
