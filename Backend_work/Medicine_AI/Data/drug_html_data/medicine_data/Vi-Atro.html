Diphenoxylate helps stop diarrhea by slowing down the movements of the intestines.</p><p>Diphenoxylate is chemically related to some narcotics and may be habit-forming if taken in doses that are larger than prescribed. If higher than normal doses of the combination are taken, the atropine will cause unpleasant effects.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Vi-Atro</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of diphenoxylate and atropine combination in children 13 years of age and older. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 13 years of age. This medicine should not be used in children younger than 6 years of age because of the risk for respiratory depression (severe breathing problem) or coma (loss of consciousness).</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of diphenoxylate and atropine combination in geriatric patients.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.
