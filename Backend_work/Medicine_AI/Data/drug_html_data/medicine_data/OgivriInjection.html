The following schedule is recommended:</p><p>In Study 1, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH (anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab) arm. In Study 3 (one-year trastuzumab treatment), the number of patients who discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In Study 4, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab) arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity.</p><p>Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (Studies 1 and 2) who developed congestive heart failure, one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as â‰¥ 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up.

Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction.</p><p>Interrupt Ogivri infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions.</p><p>There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death.</p><p>Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ogivri. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Ogivri during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of Ogivri <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Pulmonary Toxicity</h3><p class="First">Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span>. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity.</p><h3>Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia</h3><p class="First">In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label:</p><p>The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>.</p><p>In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (â‰¥ 10%) that were increased (â‰¥ 5% difference) in patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of trastuzumab treatment in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia.</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First">The data below reflect exposure to one-year trastuzumab therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, Studies 1, 2, and 3, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>The data summarized in Table 3 below, from Study 3, reflect exposure to trastuzumab in 1678 patients; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18. Among the 3386 patients enrolled in the observation and one-year trastuzumab arms of Study 3 at a median duration of follow-up of 12.6 months in the trastuzumab arm, the median age was 49 years (range: 21 to 80 years), 83% of patients were Caucasian, and 13% were Asian.</p><p class="First">Adverse Reaction</p><p class="First">One year Trastuzumab</p><p>(n = 1678)</p><p class="First">Observation</p><p>(n = 1708)</p><p class="First"> </p><p><span class="Bold">Cardiac</span></p><p class="First">Hypertension</p><p class="First">64 (4%)</p><p class="First">35 (2%)</p><p class="First">Dizziness</p><p class="First">60 (4%)</p><p class="First">29 (2%)</p><p class="First">Ejection Fraction Decreased</p><p class="First">58 (3.5%)</p><p class="First">11 (0.6%)</p><p class="First">Palpitations</p><p class="First">48 (3%)</p><p class="First">12 (0.7%)</p><p class="First">Cardiac Arrhythmiasâ€¡</p><p class="First">40 (3%)</p><p class="First">17 (1%)</p><p class="First">Cardiac Failure Congestive</p><p class="First">30 (2%)</p><p class="First">5 (0.3%)</p><p class="First">Cardiac Failure</p><p class="First">9 (0.5%)</p><p class="First">4 (0.2%)</p><p class="First">Cardiac Disorder</p><p class="First">5 (0.3%)</p><p class="First">0 (0%)</p><p class="First">Ventricular Dysfunction</p><p class="First">4 (0.2%)</p><p class="First">0 (0%)</p><p class="First"> </p><p><span class="Bold">Respiratory Thoracic Mediastinal Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Cough</p><p class="First">81 (5%)</p><p class="First">34 (2%)</p><p class="First">Influenza</p><p class="First">70 (4%)</p><p class="First">9 (0.5%)</p><p class="First">Dyspnea</p><p class="First">57 (3%)</p><p class="First">26 (2%)</p><p class="First">URI</p><p class="First">46 (3%)</p><p class="First">20 (1%)</p><p class="First">Rhinitis</p><p class="First">36 (2%)</p><p class="First">6 (0.4%)</p><p class="First">Pharyngolaryngeal Pain</p><p class="First">32 (2%)</p><p class="First">8 (0.5%)</p><p class="First">Sinusitis</p><p class="First">26 (2%)</p><p class="First">5 (0.3%)</p><p class="First">Epistaxis</p><p class="First">25 (2%)</p><p class="First">1 (0.06%)</p><p class="First">Pulmonary Hypertension</p><p class="First">4 (0.2%)</p><p class="First">0 (0%)</p><p class="First">Interstitial Pneumonitis</p><p class="First">4 (0.2%)</p><p class="First">0 (0%)</p><p class="First"> </p><p><span class="Bold">Gastrointestinal Disorders</span></p><p class="First">Diarrhea</p><p class="First">123 (7%)</p><p class="First">16 (1%)</p><p class="First">Nausea</p><p class="First">108 (6%)</p><p class="First">19 (1%)</p><p class="First">Vomiting</p><p class="First">58 (3.5%)</p><p class="First">10 (0.6%)</p><p class="First">Constipation</p><p class="First">33 (2%)</p><p class="First">17 (1%)</p><p class="First">Dyspepsia</p><p class="First">30 (2%)</p><p class="First">9 (0.5%)</p><p class="First">Upper Abdominal Pain</p><p class="First">29 (2%)</p><p class="First">15 (1%)</p><p class="First"> </p><p><span class="Bold">Musculoskeletal &amp;

In Study 3, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year trastuzumab arm); and in Studies 1 and 2, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. In Studies 1 and 2, 6% of all randomized patients with post-AC LVEF evaluation were not permitted to initiate trastuzumab following completion of AC chemotherapy due to cardiac dysfunction (LVEF &lt; LLN or â‰¥ 16 point decline in LVEF from baseline to end of AC). Following initiation of trastuzumab therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving trastuzumab and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in Studies 1 and 2, and in patients receiving one-year trastuzumab monotherapy compared to observation in Study 3 (see Table 6, Figures 1 and 2). The per-patient incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis also showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery.</p><p class="First">LVEF &lt;50%</p><p>and Absolute Decrease from Baseline</p><p class="First">Absolute LVEF Decrease</p><p class="First">LVEF</p><p>&lt; 50%</p><p class="First">â‰¥ 10%</p><p>decrease</p><p class="First">â‰¥ 16%</p><p>decrease</p><p class="First">&lt; 20% and â‰¥ 10%</p><p class="First">â‰¥ 20%</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Studies 1 &amp; 2</span></span>â€ <span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">,</span></span>â€¡</p><p class="First">  AC â†’ TH</p><p>   (n = 1856)</p><p class="First">23.1%</p><p>(428)</p><p class="First">18.5%</p><p>(344)</p><p class="First">11.2%</p><p>(208)</p><p class="First">37.9%</p><p>(703)</p><p class="First">8.9%</p><p>(166)</p><p class="First">  AC â†’ T</p><p>   (n = 1170)</p><p class="First">11.7%</p><p>(137)</p><p class="First">7.0%</p><p>(82)</p><p class="First">3.0%</p><p>(35)</p><p class="First">22.1%</p><p>(259)</p><p class="First">3.4%</p><p>(40)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Study 3</span></span>Â§</p><p class="First">  Trastuzumab</p><p>   (n = 1678)</p><p class="First">8.6%</p><p>(144)</p><p class="First">7.0%</p><p>(118)</p><p class="First">3.8%</p><p>(64)</p><p class="First">22.4%</p><p>(376)</p><p class="First">3.5%</p><p>(59)</p><p class="First">  Observation</p><p>   (n = 1708)</p><p class="First">2.7%</p><p>(46)</p><p class="First">2.0%</p><p>(35)</p><p class="First">1.2%</p><p>(20)</p><p class="First">11.9%</p><p>(204)</p><p class="First">1.2%</p><p>(21)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Study 4</span></span>Â¶</p><p class="First">  TCH</p><p>   (n = 1056)</p><p class="First">8.5%</p><p>(90)</p><p class="First">5.9%</p><p>(62)</p><p class="First">3.3%</p><p>(35)</p><p class="First">34.5%</p><p>(364)</p><p class="First">6.3%</p><p>(67)</p><p class="First">  AC â†’ TH</p><p>   (n = 1068)</p><p class="First">17%</p><p>(182)</p><p class="First">13.3%</p><p>(142)</p><p class="First">9.8%</p><p>(105)</p><p class="First">44.3%</p><p>(473)</p><p class="First">13.2%</p><p>(141)</p><p class="First">  AC â†’ T</p><p>   (n = 1050)</p><p class="First">9.5%</p><p>(100)</p><p class="First">6.6%</p><p>(69)</p><p class="First">3.3%</p><p>(35)</p><p class="First">34%</p><p>(357)</p><p class="First">5.5%</p><p>(58)</p><p>Time 0 is initiation of paclitaxel or trastuzumab + paclitaxel therapy.</p><p>Time 0 is the date of randomization.</p><p>Time 0 is the date of randomization.</p><p>The incidence of treatment emergent congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (Iâˆ’IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2).

In Study 4, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1 to 4 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving trastuzumab. Of patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.</p><p class="First">In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the trastuzumab-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm.</p><p>In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure.</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other trastuzumab products may be misleading.</p><p>Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti-human antibody (HAHA) to trastuzumab was detected in one patient using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer.</p><h3>Post-Marketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trastuzumab. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction because of trastuzumabâ€™s long washout period based on population PK analysis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab products. If anthracyclines are used, the patientâ€™s cardiac function should be monitored carefully.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><p class="First"> </p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>.</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First">Monitor women who received Ogivri during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care.</p><p class="First">In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting in the fetus as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In some case reports, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In one case, trastuzumab therapy resumed after amniotic index improved, and oligohydramnios recurred.</p><p class="First">In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First">There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating Cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the motherâ€™s clinical need for Ogivri treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ogivri or from the underlying maternal condition. This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First">In lactating cynomolgus monkeys, trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0.3% of maternal serum concentrations after pre-(beginning Gestation Day 120) and post-partum (through Post-partum Day 28) doses of 25 mg/kg administered twice weekly (25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg of trastuzumab products). Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age.</p><h3>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h3><p class="First">Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ogivri.</p><p class="First">Trastuzumab products can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Ogivri and for 7 months following the last dose of Ogivri <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of trastuzumab products in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Trastuzumab has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over (253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings). The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease in Studies 5 and 6, or adjuvant therapy in Studies 1 and 2. Limitations in data collection and differences in study design of the 4 studies of trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer preclude a determination of whether the toxicity profile of trastuzumab in older patients is different from younger patients. The reported clinical experience is not adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements (ORR, TTP, OS, DFS) of trastuzumab treatment in older patients is different from that observed in patients &lt; 65 years of age for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</p><p>In Study 7 (metastatic gastric cancer), of the 294 patients treated with trastuzumab, 108 (37%) were 65 years of age or older, while 13 (4.4%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials. Single doses higher than 8 mg/kg have not been tested.</p><h2>Ogivri Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Trastuzumab-dkst is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2. Trastuzumab-dkst is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) culture.</p><p>Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst) for injection is a sterile, off-white to pale yellow, preservative-free lyophilized powder with a cake-like appearance, for injection, for intravenous administration.</p><p>Each multiple-dose vial of Ogivri delivers 420 mg trastuzumab-dkst, D-sorbitol (322.6 mg), L-Histidine (6.0 mg), Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (9.4 mg) and Polyethylene glycol 3350/Macrogol 3350 (94.1 mg). Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust the pH of the formulation buffer. Reconstitution with 20 mL of the appropriate diluent (BWFI or SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dkst that delivers 20 mL (420 mg trastuzumab-dkst), at a pH of approximately 6. If Ogivri is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative, the reconstituted solution is considered single-dose.</p><p>Each single-dose vial of Ogivri delivers 150 mg trastuzumab-dkst, D-sorbitol (115.2 mg), L-Histidine (2.16 mg), L-Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (3.36 mg) and Polyethylene glycol 3350/Macrogol 3350 (33.6 mg). Hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust the pH of the formulation buffer. Reconstitution with 7.4 mL of sterile water for injection (SWFI) yields a solution containing 21 mg/mL trastuzumab-dkst that delivers 7.15 mL (150 mg trastuzumab-dkst), at a pH of approximately 6.</p><h2>Ogivri Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First"> </p><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The HER2 (or c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa, which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor. Trastuzumab products have been shown, in both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2.</p><p>Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, trastuzumab product-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic (ECG) endpoints, including QTc interval duration, were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors. Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic (PK) model analysis of 1,582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) receiving intravenous trastuzumab. Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non-linear elimination pathways.</p><p>Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the three-weekly schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab, the average steady-state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages. The average trastuzumab</p><p>exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage; however, the reason for this exposure difference is unknown. Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.</p><p>Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab, concentrations in at least 95% of breast cancer patients and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3% of the population predicted steady-state trough serum concentration (approximately 97% washout) by 7 months <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Schedule</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary tumor</span></p><p><span class="Bold">type</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C<span class="Sub">min</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(Âµg/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C<span class="Sub">max</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(Âµg/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC<span class="Sub">0-21days</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(Âµg.day/mL)</span></p><p class="First">8 mg/kg +</p><p>6 mg/kg q3w</p><p class="First">Breast cancer</p><p class="First">1195</p><p class="First">29.4</p><p>(5.8 to 59.5)</p><p class="First">178</p><p>(117 to 291)</p><p class="First">1373</p><p>(736 to 2245)</p><p class="First">MGC</p><p class="First">274</p><p class="First">23.1</p><p>(6.1 to50.3)</p><p class="First">132</p><p>(84.2 to 225)</p><p class="First">1109</p><p>(588 to 1938)</p><p class="First">4 mg/kg +</p><p>2 mg/kg qw</p><p class="First">Breast cancer</p><p class="First">1195</p><p class="First">37.7</p><p>(12.3 to 70.9)</p><p class="First">88.3</p><p>(58 to 144)</p><p class="First">1066</p><p>(586 to 1754)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Schedule</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Primary tumor type</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">N</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C<span class="Sub">min,ss</span></span>*</p><p><span class="Bold">(Âµg/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">C<span class="Sub">max,ss</span></span>â€ </p><p><span class="Bold">(Âµg/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">AUC<span class="Sub">ss</span>,<span class="Sub">0-21days</span></span></p><p><span class="Bold">(Âµg.day/mL)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Time to steady-state (week)</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Total CL range at steady-state (L/day)</span></p><p class="First">8 mg/kg +</p><p>6 mg/kg</p><p>q3w</p><p class="First">Breast</p><p>cancer</p><p class="First">1195</p><p class="First">47.4</p><p>(5 to 115)</p><p class="First">179</p><p>(107 to 309)</p><p class="First">1794</p><p>(673 to 3618)</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">0.173 to 0.283</p><p class="First">MGC</p><p class="First">274</p><p class="First">32.9</p><p>(6.1 to 88.9)</p><p class="First">131</p><p>(72.5 to 251)</p><p class="First">1338</p><p>(557 to 2875)</p><p class="First">9</p><p class="First">0.189 to 0.337</p><p class="First">4 mg/kg +</p><p>2 mg/kg qw</p><p class="First">Breast</p><p>cancer</p><p class="First">1195</p><p class="First">66.1</p><p>(14.9 to 142)</p><p class="First">109</p><p>(51.0 to 209)</p><p class="First">1765</p><p>(647 to 3578)</p><p class="First">12</p><p class="First">0.201 to 0.244</p><p class="First">Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no clinically significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab based on age (&lt;65 (n = 1294); â‰¥65 (n = 288)), race (Asian (n = 264); non-Asian (n = 1324)) and renal impairment (mild (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 60 to 90 mL/min) (n = 636) or moderate (CLcr 30 to 60 mL/min) (n = 133)).

Trastuzumab treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure, or persistent/recurrent LVEF decline <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]</span>. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. The primary endpoint of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as the time from randomization to recurrence, occurrence of contralateral breast cancer, other second primary cancer, or death. The secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS).</p><p>A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC â†’ paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm. The pre-planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC â†’ paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm.

The main outcome measure was Disease-Free Survival (DFS), defined as in Studies 1 and 2.</p><p>A protocol specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one-year trastuzumab treatment to observation was performed at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months in the trastuzumab arm and formed the basis for the definitive DFS results from this study. Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation (n = 1693) and trastuzumab one-year (n = 1693) treatment arms, the median age was 49 years (range 21 to 80), 83% were Caucasian, and 13% were Asian. Disease characteristics: 94% infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 50% ER+ and/or PgR+, 57% node positive, 32% node negative, and in 11% of patients, nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-six percent (1055/1098) of patients with node-negative disease had high-risk features: among the 1098 patients with node-negative disease, 49% (543) were ERâˆ’ and PgRâˆ’, and 47% (512) were ER and/or PgR + and had at least one of the following high-risk features: pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm, Grade 2 to 3, or age &lt;35 years. Prior to randomization, 94% of patients had received anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens.</p><p>After the definitive DFS results comparing observation to one-year trastuzumab treatment were disclosed, a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up duration of 8 years was performed.

Trastuzumab was administered weekly (initial dose of 4 mg/kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg/kg) concurrently with either T or TC, and then every 3 weeks (6 mg/kg) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks. Radiation therapy, if administered, was initiated after completion of chemotherapy. Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ tumors received hormonal therapy. Disease-Free Survival (DFS) was the main outcome measure.</p><p>Among the 3222 patients randomized, the median age was 49 (range 22 to 74 years; 6% â‰¥ 65 years). Disease characteristics included 54% ER+ and/or PR+ and 71% node positive. Prior to randomization, all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer.</p><p>The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of Studies 1 and 2, Study 3, and Study 4 and OS results for the integrated analysis of Studies 1 and 2, and Study 3 are presented in Table 9. For Studies 1 and 2, the duration of DFS following a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC â†’ TH arm is presented in Figure 4, and the duration of OS after a median follow-up of 8.3 years in the AC â†’ TH arm is presented in Figure 5. The duration of DFS for Study 4 is presented in Figure 6. Across all four studies, at the time of definitive DFS analysis, there were insufficient numbers of patients within each of the following subgroups to determine if the treatment effect was different from that of the overall patient population: patients with low tumor grade, patients within specific ethnic/racial subgroups (Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander patients), and patients &gt; 65 years of age. For Studies 1 and 2, the OS hazard ratio was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.74). At 8.3 years of median follow-up [AC â†’ TH], the survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC â†’ TH arm and 79.4% in the AC â†’ T arm. The final OS analysis results from Studies 1 and 2 indicate that OS benefit by age, hormone receptor status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size and grade, and surgery/radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population. In patients â‰¤ 50 years of age (n = 2197), the OS hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81) and in patients &gt; 50 years of age (n = 1866), the OS hazard ratio was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-positive disease (ER-positive and/or PR-positive) (n = 2223), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.78). In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative disease (ER-negative and PR-negative) (n = 1830), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size â‰¤ 2 cm (n = 1604), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.71). In the subgroup of patients with tumor size &gt; 2 cm (n = 2448), the hazard ratio for OS was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.80).</p><p class="First">DFS</p><p>events</p><p class="First">DFS Hazard</p><p>ratio</p><p>(95% CI)</p><p>p-value</p><p class="First">Deaths</p><p>(OS events)</p><p class="First">OS Hazard</p><p>ratio</p><p>p-value</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Studies 1 + 2</span>*</p><p class="First">AC â†’ TH</p><p>(n = 1872)â€ </p><p>(n = 2031)â€¡</p><p class="First">133â€ </p><p class="First">0.48â€ <span class="Sup">,</span>Â§</p><p>(0.39, 0.59)</p><p>p &lt; 0.0001Â¶</p><p class="First">289â€¡</p><p class="First">0.64â€¡<span class="Sup">,</span>Â§</p><p>(0.55, 0.74)</p><p>p &lt; 0.0001Â¶</p><p class="First">AC â†’ T</p><p>(n = 1880)â€ </p><p>(n = 2032)â€¡</p><p class="First">261â€ </p><p class="First">418â€¡</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 3</span>#</p><p class="First">Chemo â†’</p><p>Trastuzumab</p><p>(n = 1693)</p><p class="First">127</p><p class="First">0.54</p><p>(0.44, 0.67)</p><p>p &lt; 0.0001Ãž</p><p class="First">31</p><p class="First">0.75</p><p>p = NSÃŸ</p><p class="First">Chemo â†’</p><p>Observation</p><p>(n = 1693)</p><p class="First">219</p><p class="First">40</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Study 4</span>Ã </p><p class="First">TCH</p><p>(n = 1075)</p><p class="First">134</p><p class="First">0.67</p><p>(0.54 to 0.84)</p><p>p = 0.0006Â¶<span class="Sup">,</span>Ã¨</p><p class="First">56</p><p class="First">AC â†’ TH</p><p>(n = 1074)</p><p class="First">121</p><p class="First">0.60</p><p>(0.48 to 0.76)</p><p>p &lt; 0.0001Â¶<span class="Sup">,</span>Ã </p><p class="First">49</p><p class="First">AC â†’ T</p><p>(n = 1073)</p><p class="First">180</p><p class="First">80</p><p>Exploratory analyses of DFS as a function of HER2 overexpression or gene amplification were conducted for patients in Studies 2 and 3, where central laboratory testing data were available.

Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein. Patients were eligible if they had 2 or 3 levels of overexpression (based on a 0 to 3 scale) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab.</p><p class="First">Study 5 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Tumor specimens were tested by IHC (Clinical Trial Assay, CTA) and scored as 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+, with 3+ indicating the strongest positivity. Only patients with 2+ or 3+ positive tumors were eligible (about 33% of those screened). Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab given intravenously as a 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg. For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting, chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles); for all other patients, chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC: doxorubicin 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or epirubicin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> plus 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles). Sixty-five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received trastuzumab at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study.</p><p>Based upon the determination by an independent response evaluation committee the patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to disease progression, a higher overall response rate (ORR), and a longer median duration of response, as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone. Patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy also had a longer median survival (see Table 11). These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and in those who received trastuzumab plus AC; however the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup.</p><p class="First">Combined Results</p><p class="First">Paclitaxel Subgroup</p><p class="First">AC Subgroup</p><p class="First">trastuzumab +</p><p>All Chemo-</p><p>therapy</p><p>(n = 235)</p><p class="First">All Chemo-</p><p>therapy</p><p>(n = 234)</p><p class="First">trastuzumab +</p><p>Paclitaxel</p><p>(n = 92)</p><p class="First">Paclitaxel</p><p>(n = 96)</p><p class="First">trastuzumab +</p><p>AC*</p><p>(n = 143)</p><p class="First">AC</p><p>(n = 138)</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Primary Endpoint</span></span></p><p class="First">Median</p><p>TTP(mos)â€ <span class="Sup">,</span>â€¡</p><p class="First">7.2</p><p class="First">4.5</p><p class="First">6.7</p><p class="First">2.5</p><p class="First">7.6</p><p class="First">5.7</p><p class="First">   95% CI</p><p class="First">7, 8</p><p class="First">4, 5</p><p class="First">5, 10</p><p class="First">2, 4</p><p class="First">7, 9</p><p class="First">5, 7</p><p class="First">   p-valueÂ§</p><p class="First">&lt; 0.0001</p><p class="First">&lt; 0.0001</p><p class="First">0.002</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Secondary Endpoints</span></span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Overall</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Response</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Rate</span>â€ </p><p class="First">45</p><p class="First">29</p><p class="First">38</p><p class="First">15</p><p class="First">50</p><p class="First">38</p><p class="First">   95% CI</p><p class="First">39, 51</p><p class="First">23, 35</p><p class="First">28, 48</p><p class="First">8, 22</p><p class="First">42, 58</p><p class="First">30, 46</p><p class="First">   p-valueÂ¶</p><p class="First">&lt; 0.001</p><p class="First">&lt; 0.001</p><p class="First">0.10</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Median Resp</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Duration</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(mos)</span>â€ <span class="Sup">,</span>â€¡</p><p class="First">8.3</p><p class="First">5.8</p><p class="First">8.3</p><p class="First">4.3</p><p class="First">8.4</p><p class="First">6.4</p><p class="First">   25%, 75%</p><p>Quartile</p><p class="First">6, 15</p><p class="First">4, 8</p><p class="First">5, 11</p><p class="First">4, 7</p><p class="First">6, 15</p><p class="First">4, 8</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Med Survival</span></p><p><span class="Bold">(mos)</span>â€¡</p><p class="First">25.1</p><p class="First">20.3</p><p class="First">22.1</p><p class="First">18.4</p><p class="First">26.8</p><p class="First">21.4</p><p class="First">   95% CI</p><p class="First">22, 30</p><p class="First">17, 24</p><p class="First">17, 29</p><p class="First">13, 24</p><p class="First">23, 33</p><p class="First">18, 27</p><p class="First">   p-valueÂ§</p><p class="First">0.05</p><p class="First">0.17</p><p class="First">0.16</p><p>Data from Study 5 suggest that the beneficial treatment effects were largely limited to patients with the highest level of HER2 protein overexpression (3+) (see Table 12).</p><p class="First">HER2 Assay</p><p>Result</p><p class="First">Number of</p><p>Patients</p><p>(N)</p><p class="First">Relative Risk* for Time to</p><p>Disease Progression</p><p>(95% CI)</p><p class="First">Relative Risk* for</p><p>Mortality</p><p>(95% CI)</p><p class="First">CTA 2+ or 3+</p><p class="First">469</p><p class="First">0.49 (0.40, 0.61)</p><p class="First">0.80 (0.64, 1.00)</p><p class="First">   FISH (+)â€ </p><p class="First">325</p><p class="First">0.44 (0.34, 0.57)</p><p class="First">0.70 (0.53, 0.91)</p><p class="First">   FISH (âˆ’)â€ </p><p class="First">126</p><p class="First">0.62 (0.42, 0.94)</p><p class="First">1.06 (0.70, 1.63)</p><p class="First">CTA 2+</p><p class="First">120</p><p class="First">0.76 (0.50, 1.15)</p><p class="First">1.26 (0.82, 1.94)</p><p class="First">   FISH (+)</p><p class="First">32</p><p class="First">0.54 (0.21, 1.35)</p><p class="First">1.31 (0.53, 3.27)</p><p class="First">   FISH (âˆ’)</p><p class="First">83</p><p class="First">0.77 (0.48, 1.25)</p><p class="First">1.11 (0.68, 1.82)</p><p class="First">CTA 3+</p><p class="First">349</p><p class="First">0.42 (0.33, 0.54)</p><p class="First">0.70 (0.51, 0.90)</p><p class="First">   FISH (+)</p><p class="First">293</p><p class="First">0.42 (0.32, 0.55)</p><p class="First">0.67 (0.51, 0.89)</p><p class="First">   FISH (âˆ’)</p><p class="First">43</p><p class="First">0.43 (0.20, 0.94)</p><p class="First">0.88 (0.39, 1.98)</p><p class="First">Trastuzumab was studied as a single agent in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial (Study 6) in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had relapsed following one or two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Of 222 patients enrolled, 66% had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 68% had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease, and 25% had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg/kg IV followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg/kg IV.</p><p>The ORR (complete response + partial response), as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee, was 14%, with a 2% complete response rate and a 12% partial response rate. Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes. The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3+ was 18% while in those that tested as CTA 2+, it was 6%.</p><h3>Metastatic Gastric Cancer</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (Study 7). In this open-label, multi-center trial, 594 patients were randomized 1:1 to trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) or chemotherapy alone (FC). Randomization was stratified by extent of disease (metastatic vs. locally advanced), primary site (gastric vs. gastroesophageal junction), tumor measurability (yes vs. no), ECOG performance status (0,1 vs. 2), and fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine vs. 5-fluorouracil). All patients were either HER2 gene amplified (FISH+) or HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+). Patients were also required to have adequate cardiac function (e.g., LVEF &gt; 50%).</p><p>On the trastuzumab-containing arm, trastuzumab was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks until disease progression. On both study arms cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV infusion. On both study arms capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose orally twice daily (total daily dose 2000 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) 5-fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/day from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles.</p><p>The median age of the study population was 60 years (range: 21âˆ’83); 76% were male; 53% were Asian, 38% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 5% other racial/ethnic groups; 91% had ECOG PS of 0 or 1; 82% had primary gastric cancer and 18% had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Of these patients, 23% had undergone prior gastrectomy, 7% had received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy, and 2% had received prior radiotherapy.</p><p>The main outcome measure of Study 7 was overall survival (OS), analyzed by the unstratified logâ€‘rank test.
