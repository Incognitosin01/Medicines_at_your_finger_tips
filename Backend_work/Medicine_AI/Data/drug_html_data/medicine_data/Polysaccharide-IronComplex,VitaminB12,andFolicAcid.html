Monitor for decreased therapeutic effects of levodopa during concomitant therapy, particularly if doses cannot be separated.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex: May decrease the serum concentration of Iron Preparations. Specifically, the absorption of oral iron salts may be reduced. Management: Do not administer intravenous (IV) ferric hydroxide polymaltose complex with other oral iron preparations. Therapy with oral iron preparations should begin 1 week after the last dose of IV ferric hydroxide polymaltose complex.<i> Consider therapy modification</i></p><p>Fluorouracil Products: Folic Acid may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Fluorouracil Products. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Fosphenytoin: Folic Acid may decrease the serum concentration of Fosphenytoin. <i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Green Tea: May decrease the serum concentration of Folic Acid.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Histamine H2 Receptor Antagonists: May decrease the absorption of Iron Preparations.<i> Monitor therapy</i></p><p>Levodopa: Iron Preparations may decrease the serum concentration of Levodopa.
