</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">In male and female rats, teriparatide caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) that was dependent on dose and treatment duration. The effect was observed at systemic exposures to teriparatide ranging from 3 to 60 times the exposure in humans given a 20 mcg dose. Because of the uncertain relevance of the rat osteosarcoma finding to humans, prescribe Teriparatide Injection only for patients for whom the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risk. Teriparatide Injection should not be prescribed for patients who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma (including those with Paget's disease of bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, pediatric and young adult patients with open epiphyses, or prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>.</span></p><h2>Indications and Usage for Teriparatide Injection</h2><h3>Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture</h3><p class="First">Teriparatide Injection is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, Teriparatide Injection reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)].</span></p><h3>Increase of Bone Mass in Men with Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture</h3><p class="First">Teriparatide Injection is indicated to increase bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].</span></p><h3>Treatment of Men and Women with Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture</h3><p class="First">Teriparatide Injection is indicated for the treatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy (daily dosage equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone) at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.3)].</span></p><h2>Teriparatide Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose is 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day.</p><h3>Increase of Bone Mass in Men with Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose is 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day.</p><h3>Treatment of Men and Women with Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture</h3><p class="First">The recommended dose is 20 mcg subcutaneously once a day.</p><h3>Administration</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Teriparatide Injection should be administered as a subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdominal wall. There are no data available on the safety or efficacy of intravenous or intramuscular injection of teriparatide.</li>
<li>Teriparatide Injection should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span></li>
<li>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Teriparatide Injection is a clear and colorless liquid. Do not use if solid particles appear or if the solution is cloudy or colored.</li>
<li>Patients and caregivers who administer Teriparatide Injection should receive appropriate training and instruction on the proper use of the Teriparatide Injection delivery device from a qualified health professional <span class="Italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17.5)].</span></li>
</ul><h3>Treatment Duration</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of teriparatide have not been evaluated beyond 2 years of treatment. Consequently, use of the drug for more than 2 years during a patient's lifetime is not recommended.</p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: 620 mcg/2.48 mL (250 mcg/mL)</p><p>Colorless solution in a single-patient-use pen containing 28 daily doses of 20 mcg.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Teriparatide Injection is contraindicated in patients with:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Hypersensitivity to teriparatide or to any of its excipients. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</span></li>
</ul><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Osteosarcoma</h3><p class="First">In male and female rats, teriparatide caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) that was dependent on dose and treatment duration <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]</span>. Teriparatide Injection should not be prescribed for patients at increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma.</p><p>These include:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Paget's disease of bone. Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase may indicate Paget's disease of bone.</li>
<li>Pediatric and young adult patients with open epiphyses.</li>
<li>Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton.</li>
</ul><h3>Treatment Duration</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of teriparatide have not been evaluated beyond 2 years of treatment. Consequently, use of the drug for more than 2 years during a patients' lifetime is not recommended.</p><h3>Bone Metastases and Skeletal Malignancies</h3><p class="First">Patients with bone metastases or a history of skeletal malignancies should not be treated with Teriparatide Injection.</p><h3>Metabolic Bone Diseases</h3><p class="First">Patients with metabolic bone diseases other than osteoporosis should not be treated with Teriparatide Injection.</p><h3>Hypercalcemia and Hypercalcemic Disorders</h3><p class="First">Teriparatide has not been studied in patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia. These patients should not be treated with teriparatide because of the possibility of exacerbating hypercalcemia. Patients known to have an underlying hypercalcemic disorder, such as primary hyperparathyroidism, should not be treated with Teriparatide Injection.</p><h3>Urolithiasis or Pre-existing Hypercalciuria</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, the frequency of urolithiasis was similar in patients treated with teriparatide and placebo. However, teriparatide has not been studied in patients with active urolithiasis. If active urolithiasis or pre-existing hypercalciuria are suspected, measurement of urinary calcium excretion should be considered. Teriparatide Injection should be used with caution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis because of the potential to exacerbate this condition.</p><h3>Orthostatic Hypotension</h3><p class="First">Teriparatide Injection should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies with teriparatide, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of patients. Typically, an event began within 4 hours of dosing and spontaneously resolved within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, it was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and it did not preclude continued treatment.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">Hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity. Because teriparatide transiently increases serum calcium, patients receiving digoxin should use Teriparatide Injection with caution <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Treatment of Osteoporosis in Men and Postmenopausal Women</span></p><p>The safety of teriparatide in the treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 1382 patients (21% men, 79% women) aged 28 to 86 years (mean 67 years). The median durations of the trials were 11 months for men and 19 months for women, with 691 patients exposed to teriparatide and 691 patients to placebo. All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus at least 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.</p><p>The incidence of all cause mortality was 1% in the teriparatide group and 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 16% in teriparatide patients and 19% in placebo patients. Early discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 7% of teriparatide patients and 6% of placebo patients.</p><p>Table 1 lists adverse events from the two principal osteoporosis trials in men and postmenopausal women that occurred in ≥2% of teriparatide-treated and more frequently than placebo-treated patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Laboratory Findings</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Serum Calcium</span> — Teriparatide transiently increased serum calcium, with the maximal effect observed at approximately 4 to 6 hours post-dose. Serum calcium measured at least 16 hours post-dose was not different from pretreatment levels. In clinical trials, the frequency of at least 1 episode of transient hypercalcemia in the 4 to 6 hours after teriparatide administration was increased from 2% of women and none of the men treated with placebo to 11% of women and 6% of men treated with teriparatide. The number of patients treated with teriparatide whose transient hypercalcemia was verified on consecutive measurements was 3% of women and 1% of men.</p><p><span class="Bold">Urinary Calcium</span> — Teriparatide increased urinary calcium excretion, but the frequency of hypercalciuria in clinical trials was similar for patients treated with teriparatide and placebo <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Serum Uric Acid</span> — Teriparatide increased serum uric acid concentrations. In clinical trials, 3% of teriparatide patients had serum uric acid concentrations above the upper limit of normal compared with 1% of placebo patients. However, the hyperuricemia did not result in an increase in gout, arthralgia, or urolithiasis.</p><p><span class="Bold">Renal Function</span> — No clinically important adverse renal effects were observed in clinical studies. Assessments included creatinine clearance; measurements of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolytes in serum; urine specific gravity and pH; and examination of urine sediment.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Studies in Men and Women with Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis</span></p><p>The safety of teriparatide in the treatment of men and women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of 428 patients (19% men, 81% women) aged 22 to 89 years (mean 57 years) treated with ≥5 mg per day prednisone or equivalent for a minimum of 3 months. The duration of the trial was 18 months with 214 patients exposed to teriparatide and 214 patients exposed to oral daily bisphosphonate (active control). All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.</p><p>The incidence of all cause mortality was 4% in the teriparatide group and 6% in the active control group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 21% in teriparatide patients and 18% in active control patients, and included pneumonia (3% teriparatide, 1% active control). Early discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 15% of teriparatide patients and 12% of active control patients, and included dizziness (2% teriparatide, 0% active control).</p><p>Adverse events reported at a higher incidence in the teriparatide group and with at least a 2% difference in teriparatide-treated patients compared with active control-treated patients were: nausea (14%, 7%), gastritis (7%, 3%), pneumonia (6%, 3%), dyspnea (6%, 3%), insomnia (5%, 1%), anxiety (4%, 1%), and herpes zoster (3%, 1%), respectively.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of teriparatide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Osteosarcoma: Cases of bone tumor and osteosarcoma have been reported rarely in the postmarketing period. The causality to teriparatide use is unclear. Long term osteosarcoma surveillance studies are ongoing <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia greater than 13.0 mg/dL has been reported with teriparatide use.</li>
</ul><p>Adverse events reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to teriparatide therapy include the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Allergic Reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, drug hypersensitivity, angioedema, urticaria</li>
<li>Investigations: Hyperuricemia</li>
<li>Respiratory System: Acute dyspnea, chest pain</li>
<li>Musculoskeletal: Muscle spasms of the leg or back</li>
<li>Other: Injection site reactions including injection site pain, swelling and bruising; oro-facial edema</li>
</ul><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all peptides, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to teriparatide in the study described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other teriparatide products may be misleading.</p><p>The immunogenicity profile of Teriparatide Injection was evaluated in a 24-week randomized trial comparing the effects of Teriparatide Injection 20 mcg daily with another teriparatide product 20 mcg daily. In this trial, 2.2% (2/90) subjects who received Teriparatide Injection and 2.2% (2/91) subjects who received the other teriparatide product had detectable antibodies to teriparatide and one out of the two Teriparatide Injection treated patients developed neutralizing antibodies to teriparatide.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Digoxin</h3><p class="First">A single teriparatide dose did not alter the effect of digoxin on the systolic time interval (from electrocardiographic Q-wave onset to aortic valve closure, a measure of digoxin's calcium-mediated cardiac effect). However, because teriparatide may transiently increase serum calcium, Teriparatide Injection should be used with caution in patients taking digoxin <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precaution (5.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Hydrochlorothiazide</h3><p class="First">The coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg with teriparatide did not affect the serum calcium response to teriparatide 40 mcg. The effect of coadministration of a higher dose of hydrochlorothiazide with teriparatide on serum calcium levels has not been studied <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Furosemide</h3><p class="First">Coadministration of intravenous furosemide (20 to 100 mg) with teriparatide 40 mcg in healthy people and patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (CrCl 13 to 72 mL/min) resulted in small increases in the serum calcium (2%) and 24-hour urine calcium (37%) responses to teriparatide that did not appear to be clinically important <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no available data on Teriparatide Injection use in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Consider discontinuing Teriparatide Injection when pregnancy is recognized.</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, teriparatide increased skeletal deviations and variations in mouse offspring at subcutaneous doses equivalent to more than 60 times the recommended 20 mcg human daily dose (based on body surface area, mcg/m2), and produced mild growth retardation and reduced motor activity in rat offspring at subcutaneous doses equivalent to more than 120 times the human dose <span class="Italics">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The background risk in the US general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</p><p><span class="Bold Italics">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>In animal reproduction studies, pregnant mice received teriparatide during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses 8 to 267 times the human dose (based on body surface area, mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>). At doses ≥60 times the human dose, the fetuses showed an increased incidence of skeletal deviations or variations (interrupted rib, extra vertebra or rib). When pregnant rats received subcutaneous teriparatide during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses 16 to 540 times the human dose, the fetuses showed no abnormal findings.</p><p>In a perinatal/postnatal study in pregnant rats dosed subcutaneously from organogenesis through lactation, mild growth retardation was observed in female offspring at doses ≥120 times the human dose. Mild growth retardation in male offspring and reduced motor activity in both male and female offspring were observed at maternal doses of 540 times the human dose. There were no developmental or reproductive effects in mice or rats at doses 8 or 16 times the human dose, respectively.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold Italics">Risk Summary</span></p><p>It is not known whether teriparatide is excreted in human milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breast fed infant.</p><p>Because of the potential for osteosarcoma shown with teriparatide in animal studies, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Teriparatide Injection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of teriparatide have not been established in any pediatric population. Teriparatide Injection should not be prescribed in patients at an increased baseline risk of osteosarcoma which include pediatric and young adult patients with open epiphyses. Therefore, Teriparatide Injection is not indicated for use in pediatric or young adult patients with open epiphyses <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the patients receiving teriparatide in the osteoporosis trial of 1637 postmenopausal women, 75% were 65 years of age and over and 23% were 75 years of age and over. Of the patients receiving teriparatide in the osteoporosis trial of 437 men, 39% were 65 years of age and over and 13% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">In 5 patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min), the AUC and T<span class="Sub">1/2</span> of teriparatide were increased by 73% and 77%, respectively. Maximum serum concentration of teriparatide was not increased <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Incidents of overdose in humans have not been reported in clinical trials. Teriparatide has been administered in single doses of up to 100 mcg and in repeated doses of up to 60 mcg/day for 6 weeks. The effects of overdose that might be expected include a delayed hypercalcemic effect and risk of orthostatic hypotension. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache might also occur.</p><p>In postmarketing spontaneous reports, there have been cases of medication errors in which the entire contents (up to 800 mcg) of the teriparatide delivery device (pen) have been administered as a single dose. Transient events reported have included nausea, weakness/lethargy and hypotension. In some cases, no adverse events occurred as a result of the overdose. No fatalities associated with overdose have been reported.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Overdose Management</span> — There is no specific antidote for teriparatide. Treatment of suspected overdose should include discontinuation of Teriparatide Injection, monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus, and implementation of appropriate supportive measures, such as hydration.</p><h2>Teriparatide Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Teriparatide Injection is a recombinant human parathyroid hormone analog (PTH 1-34). It has an identical sequence to the 34 N‑terminal amino acids (the biologically active region) of the 84-amino acid human parathyroid hormone.</p><p>The molecular formula of teriparatide is C<span class="Sub">181</span>H<span class="Sub">291</span>N<span class="Sub">55</span>O<span class="Sub">51</span>S<span class="Sub">2</span> and the molecular weight is 4117.8 daltons. Its amino acid sequence is shown below:</p><p>Teriparatide is manufactured using a strain of <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas fluorescens</span> modified by recombinant DNA technology. Teriparatide Injection is supplied as a sterile, colorless, clear, isotonic solution in a glass cartridge which is pre-assembled into a single-patient-use delivery device (pen) for subcutaneous injection. Each pen is filled to deliver 2.48 mL. Each mL contains 250 mcg teriparatide (as a free base), 0.41 mg glacial acetic acid, 0.10 mg sodium acetate, 45.4 mg mannitol, 3 mg metacresol, and water for injection. The drug product is a pH 4.0 solution.</p><p>Each cartridge, pre-assembled into a delivery device, delivers 20 mcg of teriparatide per dose each day for up to 28 days.</p><h2>Teriparatide Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Endogenous 84-amino acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney. Teriparatide is not expected to accumulate in bone or other tissues.</p><p>The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. In monkey studies, teriparatide improved trabecular microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength by stimulating new bone formation in both cancellous and cortical bone. In humans, the anabolic effects of teriparatide manifest as an increase in skeletal mass, an increase in markers of bone formation and resorption, and an increase in bone strength. By contrast, continuous excess of endogenous PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, may be detrimental to the skeleton because bone resorption may be stimulated more than bone formation.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics Underline">Pharmacodynamics in Men and Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on Mineral Metabolism</span> — Teriparatide affects calcium and phosphorus metabolism in a pattern consistent with the known actions of endogenous PTH (e.g., increases serum calcium and decreases serum phosphorus).</p><p><span class="Bold">Serum Calcium Concentrations</span> — When teriparatide 20 mcg is administered once daily, the serum calcium concentration increases transiently, beginning approximately 2 hours after dosing and reaching a maximum concentration between 4 and 6 hours (median increase, 0.4 mg/dL). The serum calcium concentration begins to decline approximately 6 hours after dosing and returns to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose.</p><p>In a clinical study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the median peak serum calcium concentration measured 4 to 6 hours after dosing with teriparatide (teriparatide 20 mcg) was 2.42 mmol/L (9.68 mg/dL) at 12 months. The peak serum calcium remained below 2.76 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL) in &gt;99% of women at each visit. Sustained hypercalcemia was not observed.</p><p>In this study, 11.1% of women treated with teriparatide had at least 1 serum calcium value above the upper limit of normal [2.64 mmol/L (10.6 mg/dL)] compared with 1.5% of women treated with placebo. The percentage of women treated with teriparatide whose serum calcium was above the upper limit of normal on consecutive 4- to 6-hour post-dose measurements was 3.0% compared with 0.2% of women treated with placebo. In these women, calcium supplements and/or teriparatide doses were reduced. The timing of these dose reductions was at the discretion of the investigator. Teriparatide dose adjustments were made at varying intervals after the first observation of increased serum calcium (median 21 weeks). During these intervals, there was no evidence of progressive increases in serum calcium.</p><p>In a clinical study of men with either primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis, the effects on serum calcium were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women. The median peak serum calcium concentration measured 4 to 6 hours after dosing with teriparatide was 2.35 mmol/L (9.44 mg/dL) at 12 months. The peak serum calcium remained below 2.76 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL) in 98% of men at each visit. Sustained hypercalcemia was not observed.</p><p>In this study, 6.0% of men treated with teriparatide daily had at least 1 serum calcium value above the upper limit of normal [2.64 mmol/L (10.6 mg/dL)] compared with none of the men treated with placebo. The percentage of men treated with teriparatide whose serum calcium was above the upper limit of normal on consecutive measurements was 1.3% (2 men) compared with none of the men treated with placebo. Although calcium supplements and/or teriparatide doses could have been reduced in these men, only calcium supplementation was reduced <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><p>In a clinical study of women previously treated for 18 to 39 months with raloxifene (n=26) or alendronate (n=33), mean serum calcium &gt;12 hours after Teriparatide Injection was increased by 0.09 to 0.14 mmol/L (0.36 to 0.56 mg/dL), after 1 to 6 months of teriparatide treatment compared with baseline. Of the women pretreated with raloxifene, 3 (11.5%) had a serum calcium &gt;2.76 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL), and of those pretreated with alendronate, 3 (9.1%) had a serum calcium &gt;2.76 mmol/L (11.0 mg/dL). The highest serum calcium reported was 3.12 mmol/L (12.5 mg/dL). None of the women had symptoms of hypercalcemia. There were no placebo controls in this study.</p><p>In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of teriparatide on serum calcium were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Urinary Calcium Excretion</span> — In a clinical study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who received 1000 mg of supplemental calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D, daily teriparatide increased urinary calcium excretion. The median urinary excretion of calcium was 4.8 mmol/day (190 mg/day) at 6 months and 4.2 mmol/day (170 mg/day) at 12 months. These levels were 0.76 mmol/day (30 mg/day) and 0.3 mmol/day (12 mg/day) higher, respectively, than in women treated with placebo. The incidence of hypercalciuria (&gt;7.5 mmol Ca/day or 300 mg/day) was similar in the women treated with teriparatide or placebo.</p><p>In a clinical study of men with either primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis who received 1000 mg of supplemental calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D, daily teriparatide had inconsistent effects on urinary calcium excretion. The median urinary excretion of calcium was 5.6 mmol/day (220 mg/day) at 1 month and 5.3 mmol/day (210 mg/day) at 6 months. These levels were 0.5 mmol/day (20 mg/day) higher and 0.2 mmol/day (8.0 mg/day) lower, respectively, than in men treated with placebo. The incidence of hypercalciuria (&gt;7.5 mmol Ca/day or 300 mg/day) was similar in the men treated with teriparatide or placebo.</p><p><span class="Bold">Phosphorus and Vitamin D</span> — In single-dose studies, teriparatide produced transient phosphaturia and mild transient reductions in serum phosphorus concentration. However, hypophosphatemia (&lt;0.74 mmol/L or 2.4 mg/dL) was not observed in clinical trials with teriparatide.</p><p>In clinical trials of daily teriparatide, the median serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was increased at 12 months by 19% in women and 14% in men, compared with baseline. In the placebo group, this concentration decreased by 2% in women and increased by 5% in men. The median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at 12 months was decreased by 19% in women and 10% in men compared with baseline. In the placebo group, this concentration was unchanged in women and increased by 1% in men.</p><p>In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of teriparatide on serum phosphorus were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Effects on Markers of Bone Turnover</span> — Daily administration of teriparatide to men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in clinical studies stimulated bone formation, as shown by increases in the formation markers serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP). Data on biochemical markers of bone turnover were available for the first 12 months of treatment. Peak concentrations of PICP at 1 month of treatment were approximately 41% above baseline, followed by a decline to near-baseline values by 12 months. BSAP concentrations increased by 1 month of treatment and continued to rise more slowly from 6 through 12 months. The maximum increases of BSAP were 45% above baseline in women and 23% in men. After discontinuation of therapy, BSAP concentrations returned toward baseline. The increases in formation markers were accompanied by secondary increases in the markers of bone resorption: urinary N-telopeptide (NTX) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling. Changes in BSAP, NTX, and DPD were lower in men than in women, possibly because of lower systemic exposure to teriparatide in men.</p><p>In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of teriparatide on serum markers of bone turnover were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids.</p><p><span class="Bold">Digoxin</span> — In a study of 15 healthy people administered digoxin daily to steady state, a single teriparatide dose did not alter the effect of digoxin on the systolic time interval (from electrocardiographic Q-wave onset to aortic valve closure, a measure of digoxin's calcium-mediated cardiac effect). However, sporadic case reports have suggested that hypercalcemia may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity.

In the first study, male and female rats were given daily subcutaneous Teriparatide Injections of 5, 30, or 75 mcg/kg/day for 24 months from 2 months of age. These doses resulted in systemic exposures that were, respectively, 3, 20, and 60 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans following a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg (based on AUC comparison). Teriparatide treatment resulted in a marked dose-related increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma, a rare malignant bone tumor, in both male and female rats. Osteosarcomas were observed at all doses and the incidence reached 40% to 50% in the high-dose groups. Teriparatide also caused a dose-related increase in osteoblastoma and osteoma in both sexes. No osteosarcomas, osteoblastomas or osteomas were observed in untreated control rats. The bone tumors in rats occurred in association with a large increase in bone mass and focal osteoblast hyperplasia.</p><p>The second 2-year study was carried out in order to determine the effect of treatment duration and animal age on the development of bone tumors. Female rats were treated for different periods between 2 and 26 months of age with subcutaneous doses of 5 and 30 mcg/kg (equivalent to 3 and 20 times the human exposure at the 20-mcg dose, based on AUC comparison). The study showed that the occurrence of osteosarcoma, osteoblastoma and osteoma was dependent upon dose and duration of exposure. Bone tumors were observed when immature 2-month old rats were treated with 30 mcg/kg/day for 24 months or with 5 or 30 mcg/kg/day for 6 months. Bone tumors were also observed when mature 6-month old rats were treated with 30 mcg/kg/day for 6 or 20 months. Tumors were not detected when mature 6-month old rats were treated with 5 mcg/kg/day for 6 or 20 months. The results did not demonstrate a difference in susceptibility to bone tumor formation, associated with teriparatide treatment, between mature and immature rats.</p><p>The relevance of these animal findings to humans is uncertain.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span> — Teriparatide was not genotoxic in any of the following test systems: the Ames test for bacterial mutagenesis; the mouse lymphoma assay for mammalian cell mutation; the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without metabolic activation; and the in vivo micronucleus test in mice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span> — No effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats given subcutaneous teriparatide doses of 30, 100, or 300 mcg/kg/day prior to mating and in females continuing through gestation Day 6 (16 to 160 times the human dose of 20 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h3>Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h3><p class="First">In single-dose rodent studies using subcutaneous injection of teriparatide, no mortality was seen in rats given doses of 1000 mcg/kg (540 times the human dose based on surface area, mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) or in mice given 10,000 mcg/kg (2700 times the human dose based on surface area, mcg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><p>In a long-term study, skeletally mature ovariectomized female monkeys (N=30 per treatment group) were given either daily subcutaneous Teriparatide Injections of 5 mcg/kg or vehicle.
