It is also used to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and unstable angina (chest pain) requiring hospitalization in adults with existing heart or blood vessel disease. Alirocumab is a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) inhibitor.</p><p>Alirocumab is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using alirocumab</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For alirocumab, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to alirocumab or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of alirocumab injection in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of alirocumab injection in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of alirocumab than younger adults.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.</p><h3>Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol</h3><p>Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of alirocumab</h2><p>Alirocumab is given as a shot under your skin, usually in the abdomen or stomach, thighs, or upper arms.</p><p>Alirocumab may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital. If you are using alirocumab at home, your doctor will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand exactly how the medicine is prepared and injected.</p><p>Alirocumab should come with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>Alirocumab comes in 2 forms: single-dose prefilled pen (autoinjector) and single-dose prefilled syringe. Your doctor will prescribe the type and dose that is right for you.</p><p>You will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems from the injections.</p><p>Do not inject other medicines together with alirocumab injection at the same injection site.</p><p>Do not inject on skin areas that have cuts, scrapes, infection, scars, sunburns, or tattoos.</p><p>Allow the medicine to warm to room temperature for at least 30 to 40 minutes before using it. Do not warm it in any other way. Do not shake the medicine.</p><p>Use each autoinjector pen or syringe only one time. Do not save an open pen or syringe. If the medicine in the pen or syringe has changed color, or if you see particles in it, do not use it.</p><p>In addition to alirocumab, your doctor may change your diet to one that is low in fat, sugar, and cholesterol. <i>Carefully follow your doctor's order about any special diet</i>.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of alirocumab will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of alirocumab. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine.
