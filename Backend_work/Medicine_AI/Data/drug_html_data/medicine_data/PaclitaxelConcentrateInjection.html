</ul><p class="First">Rx Only</p><p>(Patient Information Included)</p><h3>WARNING</h3><p class="First">Paclitaxel injection should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available.</p><p>Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2 to 4% of patients receiving paclitaxel in clinical trials. Fatal reactions have occurred in patients despite premedication. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H<span class="Sub">2</span> antagonists (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel injection should not be rechallenged with the drug.</p><p>Paclitaxel injection therapy should not be given to patients with solid tumors who have baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma if the baseline neutrophil count is less than 1000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. In order to monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primarily neutropenia, which may be severe and result in infection, it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving paclitaxel injection.</p><h2>Paclitaxel Concentrate Injection Description</h2><p class="First">Paclitaxel Injection USP is a clear, colorless to slightly yellow viscous solution. It is supplied as a nonaqueous solution intended for dilution with a suitable parenteral fluid prior to intravenous infusion. Paclitaxel Injection USP is available in 30 mg (5 mL), 100 mg (16.7 mL), and 300 mg (50 mL) multidose vials. Each mL of sterile nonpyrogenic solution contains 6 mg paclitaxel, USP, 527 mg of polyoxyl 35 castor oil, 2 mg of anhydrous citric acid, and 49.7% (v/v) and 39.6% (w/v) dehydrated alcohol. Paclitaxel, USP is a semi-synthetic product with antitumor activity. Paclitaxel, USP is obtained from <span class="Italics">Taxus</span> species. The chemical name for paclitaxel, USP is 5β,20-Epoxy-1,2α,4,7β,10β,13α-hexahydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2<span class="Italics">R</span>,3<span class="Italics">S</span>)-<span class="Italics">N</span>-benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine.</p><p>Paclitaxel, USP has the following structural formula:</p><p>C<span class="Sub">47</span>H<span class="Sub">51</span>NO<span class="Sub">14</span>     M.W. 853.9</p><p>Paclitaxel, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is highly lipophilic, insoluble in water, and melts at around 216 to 217° C.</p><h2>Paclitaxel Concentrate Injection - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><p class="First">Paclitaxel is a novel antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.</p><p>Following intravenous administration of paclitaxel, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner. The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartment and elimination of the drug. The later phase is due, in part, to a relatively slow efflux of paclitaxel from the peripheral compartment.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel following 3 and 24 hour infusions of paclitaxel at dose levels of 135 and 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> were determined in a Phase 3 randomized study in ovarian cancer patients and are summarized in the following table.</p><p class="First">Dose<br/>

(135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> vs. 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) increased the C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 87%, whereas the AUC<span class="Sub">(0-∞)</span> remained proportional. However, with a 3 hour infusion, for a 30% increase in dose, the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC<span class="Sub">(0-∞)</span> were increased by 68% and 89%, respectively. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state, with the 24 hour infusion of paclitaxel, ranged from 227 to 688 L/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, indicating extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel were also evaluated in adult cancer patients who received single doses of 15 to 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given by 1 hour infusions (n = 15), 30 to 275 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given by 6 hour infusions (n = 36), and 200 to 275 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given by 24 hour infusions (n = 54) in Phase 1 and 2 studies. Values for CL<span class="Sub">T</span> and volume of distribution were consistent with the findings in the Phase 3 study. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma have not been studied.</p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 mcg/mL, indicate that between 89 to 98% of drug is bound; the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel.</p><p>After intravenous administration of 15 to 275 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> doses of paclitaxel as 1, 6, or 24 hour infusions, mean values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug ranged from 1.3% to 12.6% of the dose, indicating extensive non-renal clearance. In 5 patients administered a 225 or 250 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> dose of radiolabeled paclitaxel as a 3 hour infusion, a mean of 71% of the radioactivity was excreted in the feces in 120 hours, and 14% was recovered in the urine. Total recovery of radioactivity ranged from 56% to 101% of the dose. Paclitaxel represented a mean of 5% of the administered radioactivity recovered in the feces, while metabolites, primarily 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, accounted for the balance. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel was metabolized primarily to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2C8; and to 2 minor metabolites, 3′-<span class="Italics">p</span>-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α, 3′-<span class="Italics">p</span>-dihydroxypaclitaxel, by CYP3A4. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>, the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents (ketoconazole, verapamil, diazepam, quinidine, dexamethasone, cyclosporin, teniposide, etoposide, and vincristine), but the concentrations used exceeded those found <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> following normal therapeutic doses. Testosterone, 17α-ethinyl estradiol, retinoic acid, and quercetin, a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8, also inhibited the formation of 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel <span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and/or CYP3A4 (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p>The disposition and toxicity of paclitaxel 3 hour infusion were evaluated in 35 patients with varying degrees of hepatic function. Relative to patients with normal bilirubin, plasma paclitaxel exposure in patients with abnormal serum bilirubin ≤ 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) administered 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> was increased, but with no apparent increase in the frequency or severity of toxicity. In 5 patients with serum total bilirubin &gt; 2 times ULN, there was a statistically nonsignificant higher incidence of severe myelosuppression, even at a reduced dose (110 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>), but no observed increase in plasma exposure (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Hepatic</span> and <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). The effect of renal dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been investigated.</p><p>Possible interactions of paclitaxel with concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Ovarian Carcinoma</h3><p class="First">The safety and efficacy of paclitaxel followed by cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and no prior chemotherapy were evaluated in 2, Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. In an Intergroup study led by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer involving the Scandinavian Group NOCOVA, the National Cancer Institute of Canada, and the Scottish Group, 680 patients with Stage II<span class="Sub">B-C</span>, III, or IV disease (optimally or non-optimally debulked) received either paclitaxel 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> infused over 3 hours followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (Tc) or cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (Cc) for a median of 6 courses. Although the protocol allowed further therapy, only 15% received both drugs for 9 or more courses. In a study conducted by the Gynecological Oncology Group (GOG), 410 patients with Stage III or IV disease (&gt; 1 cm residual disease after staging laparotomy or distant metastases) received either paclitaxel 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> infused over 24 hours followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> for 6 courses.</p><p>In both studies, patients treated with paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin had significantly higher response rate, longer time to progression, and longer survival time compared with standard therapy. These differences were also significant for the subset of patients in the Intergroup study with non-optimally debulked disease, although the study was not fully powered for subset analyses (<span class="Bold">TABLES 2A</span> and <span class="Bold">2B</span>).

This multicenter trial was conducted in women with histologically positive lymph nodes following either a mastectomy or segmental mastectomy and nodal dissections. The 3 x 2 factorial study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3 different dose levels of doxorubicin (A) and to evaluate the effect of the addition of paclitaxel administered following the completion of AC therapy. After stratification for the number of positive lymph nodes (1 to 3, 4 to 9, or 10+), patients were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide at a dose of 600 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and doxorubicin at doses of either 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (on day 1), 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (in 2 divided doses on days 1 and 2), or 90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (in 2 divided doses on days 1 and 2 with prophylactic G-CSF support and ciprofloxacin) every 3 weeks for 4 courses and either paclitaxel 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> as a 3 hour infusion every 3 weeks for 4 additional courses or no additional chemotherapy. Patients whose tumors were positive were to receive subsequent tamoxifen treatment (20 mg daily for 5 years); patients who received segmental mastectomies prior to study were to receive breast irradiation after recovery from treatment-related toxicities.</p><p>At the time of the current analysis, median follow-up was 30.1 months. Of the 2066 patients who were hormone receptor positive, 93% received tamoxifen. The primary analyses of disease-free survival and overall survival used multivariate Cox models, which included paclitaxel administration, doxorubicin dose, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size, menopausal status, and estrogen receptor status as factors. Based on the model for disease-free survival, patients receiving AC followed by paclitaxel had a 22% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence compared to patients randomized to AC alone (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.91, p = 0.0022). They also had a 26% reduction in the risk of death (HR = 0.74, 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92, p = 0.0065). For disease-free survival and overall survival, p-values were not adjusted for interim analyses. Kaplan-Meier curves are shown in <span class="Bold">FIGURES 3</span> and <span class="Bold">4</span>. Increasing the dose of doxorubicin higher than 60 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> had no effect on either disease-free survival or overall survival.</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">FIGURE 3: DISEASE-FREE SURVIVAL: AC VERSUS AC+T</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">FIGURE 4: SURVIVAL: AC VERSUS AC+T</p><p class="First">Subsets defined by variables of known prognostic importance in adjuvant breast carcinoma were examined, including number of positive lymph nodes, tumor size, hormone receptor status, and menopausal status. Such analyses must be interpreted with care, as the most secure finding is the overall study result. In general, a reduction in hazard similar to the overall reduction was seen with paclitaxel for both disease-free and overall survival in all of the larger subsets with one exception; patients with receptor-positive tumors had a smaller reduction in hazard (HR = 0.92) for disease-free survival with paclitaxel than other groups.

Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated.</p><p>Paclitaxel Injection USP, in combination with cisplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy.</p><p>Paclitaxel Injection USP is indicated for the second-line treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Paclitaxel injection is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel injection or other drugs formulated in polyoxyl 35 castor oil, NF.</p><p>Paclitaxel injection should not be used in patients with solid tumors who have baseline neutrophil counts of &lt; 1500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> or in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma with baseline neutrophil counts of &lt; 1000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First">Anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by dyspnea and hypotension requiring treatment, angioedema, and generalized urticaria have occurred in 2 to 4% of patients receiving paclitaxel in clinical trials. Fatal reactions have occurred in patients despite premedication. All patients should be pretreated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H<span class="Sub">2</span> antagonists (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>). Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel injection should not be rechallenged with the drug.</p><p>Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) is dose-dependent and is the dose-limiting toxicity. Neutrophil nadirs occurred at a median of 11 days. Paclitaxel injection should not be administered to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> (&lt; 1000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> for patients with KS). Frequent monitoring of blood counts should be instituted during paclitaxel injection treatment. Patients should not be re-treated with subsequent cycles of paclitaxel injection until neutrophils recover to a level &gt; 1500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> (&gt; 1000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> for patients with KS) and platelets recover to a level &gt; 100,000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>.</p><p>Severe conduction abnormalities have been documented in &lt; 1% of patients during paclitaxel injection therapy and in some cases requiring pacemaker placement. If patients develop significant conduction abnormalities during paclitaxel infusion, appropriate therapy should be administered and continuous cardiac monitoring should be performed during subsequent therapy with paclitaxel injection.</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">Paclitaxel injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of paclitaxel during the period of organogenesis to rabbits at doses of 3 mg/kg/day (about 0.2 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis) caused embryo- and fetotoxicity, as indicated by intrauterine mortality, increased resorptions, and increased fetal deaths. Maternal toxicity was also observed at this dose. No teratogenic effects were observed at 1 mg/kg/day (about 1/15 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis); teratogenic potential could not be assessed at higher doses due to extensive fetal mortality.</p><p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If paclitaxel injection is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.</p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">Contact of the undiluted concentrate with plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) equipment or devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended. In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate], which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel injection solutions should preferably be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets.</p><p>Paclitaxel injection should be administered through an in-line filter with a microporous membrane not greater than 0.22 microns. Use of filter devices such as IVEX-2<span class="Sup">®</span> filters which incorporate short inlet and outlet PVC-coated tubing has not resulted in significant leaching of DEHP.</p><h3>Drug Interactions</h3><p class="First">In a Phase 1 trial using escalating doses of paclitaxel (110 to 200 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and cisplatin (50 or 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>) given as sequential infusions, myelosuppression was more profound when paclitaxel was given after cisplatin than with the alternate sequence (i.e., paclitaxel before cisplatin). Pharmacokinetic data from these patients demonstrated a decrease in paclitaxel clearance of approximately 33% when paclitaxel was administered following cisplatin.</p><p>The metabolism of paclitaxel injection is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with known substrates or inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Caution should be exercised when paclitaxel injection is concomitantly administered with known substrates (e.g., midazolam, buspirone, felodipine, lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenafil, simvastatin, and triazolam), inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin), and inducers (e.g., rifampin and carbamazepine) of CYP3A4 (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><p>Caution should also be exercised when paclitaxel injection is concomitantly administered with known substrates (e.g., repaglinide and rosiglitazone), inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil), and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of CYP2C8 (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>).</p><p>Potential interactions between paclitaxel injection, a substrate of CYP3A4, and protease inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir), which are substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4, have not been evaluated in clinical trials.</p><p>Reports in the literature suggest that plasma levels of doxorubicin (and its active metabolite doxorubicinol) may be increased when paclitaxel and doxorubicin are used in combination.</p><h3>Hematology</h3><p class="First">Paclitaxel injection therapy should not be administered to patients with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. In order to monitor the occurrence of myelotoxicity, it is recommended that frequent peripheral blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving paclitaxel injection. Patients should not be re-treated with subsequent cycles of paclitaxel injection until neutrophils recover to a level &gt; 1500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and platelets recover to a level &gt; 100,000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. In the case of severe neutropenia (&lt; 500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> for 7 days or more) during a course of paclitaxel injection therapy, a 20% reduction in dose for subsequent courses of therapy is recommended.</p><p>For patients with advanced HIV disease and poor-risk AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, paclitaxel injection, at the recommended dose for this disease, can be initiated and repeated if the neutrophil count is at least 1000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to products containing polyoxyl 35 castor oil, NF (e.g., cyclosporin for injection concentrate and teniposide for injection concentrate) should not be treated with paclitaxel injection. In order to avoid the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions, all patients treated with paclitaxel injection should be premedicated with corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone), diphenhydramine and H<span class="Sub">2</span> antagonists (such as cimetidine or ranitidine). Minor symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnea, hypotension, or tachycardia do not require interruption of therapy. However, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema, or generalized urticaria require immediate discontinuation of paclitaxel injection and aggressive symptomatic therapy. Patients who have developed severe hypersensitivity reactions should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel injection.</p><h3>Cardiovascular</h3><p class="First">Hypotension, bradycardia, and hypertension have been observed during administration of paclitaxel injection, but generally do not require treatment. Occasionally paclitaxel injection infusions must be interrupted or discontinued because of initial or recurrent hypertension. Frequent vital sign monitoring, particularly during the first hour of paclitaxel injection infusion, is recommended. Continuous cardiac monitoring is not required except for patients with serious conduction abnormalities (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>). When paclitaxel injection is used in combination with doxorubicin for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, monitoring of cardiac function is recommended (see <span class="Bold">ADVERSE REACTIONS</span>).</p><h3>Nervous System</h3><p class="First">Although the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy is frequent, the development of severe symptomatology is unusual and requires a dose reduction of 20% for all subsequent courses of paclitaxel injection.</p><p>Paclitaxel injection contains dehydrated alcohol, USP, 396 mg/mL; consideration should be given to possible CNS and other effects of alcohol (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</span>).</p><h3>Hepatic</h3><p class="First">There is limited evidence that the myelotoxicity of paclitaxel may be exacerbated in patients with serum total bilirubin &gt; 2 times ULN (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span>). Extreme caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel injection to such patients, with dose reduction as recommended in <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>, <span class="Bold">TABLE 17</span>.</p><h3>Injection Site Reaction</h3><p class="First">Injection site reactions, including reactions secondary to extravasation, were usually mild and consisted of erythema, tenderness, skin discoloration, or swelling at the injection site. These reactions have been observed more frequently with the 24 hour infusion than with the 3 hour infusion. Recurrence of skin reactions at a site of previous extravasation following administration of paclitaxel injection at a different site, i.e., “recall,” has been reported.</p><p>More severe events such as phlebitis, cellulitis, induration, skin exfoliation, necrosis, and fibrosis have been reported. In some cases the onset of the injection site reaction either occurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed by a week to 10 days.</p><p>A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time. Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied.</p><p>Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> (chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> (micronucleus test in mice). Paclitaxel was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the CHO/HGPRT gene mutation assay.</p><p>Administration of paclitaxel prior to and during mating produced impairment of fertility in male and female rats at doses equal to or greater than 1 mg/kg/day (about 0.04 the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). At this dose, to or greater than 1 mg/kg/day (about 0.04 the daily maximum recommended human on a mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> basis). At this dose, paclitaxel caused reduced fertility and reproductive indices, and increased embryo- and fetotoxicity (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span>).</p><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First">(See <span class="Bold">WARNINGS.</span>)</p><h3>Nursing Mothers</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk. Following intravenous administration of carbon 14 labeled paclitaxel to rats on days 9 to 10 postpartum, concentrations of radioactivity in milk were higher than in plasma and declined in parallel with the plasma concentrations. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued when receiving paclitaxel injection therapy.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of paclitaxel injection in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><p>There have been reports of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (rarely associated with death) in a clinical trial in pediatric patients in which paclitaxel was infused intravenously over 3 hours at doses ranging from 350 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> to 420 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>. The toxicity is most likely attributable to the high dose of the ethanol component of the paclitaxel vehicle given over a short infusion time. The use of concomitant antihistamines may intensify this effect. Although a direct effect of the paclitaxel itself cannot be discounted, the high doses used in this study (over twice the recommended adult dosage) must be considered in assessing the discounted; the high doses used in this study safety of paclitaxel for use in this population.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of 2228 patients who received paclitaxel in 8 clinical studies evaluating its safety and effectiveness in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, breast carcinoma, or NSCLC, and 1570 patients who were randomized to receive paclitaxel in the adjuvant breast cancer study, 649 patients (17%) were 65 years or older and 49 patients (1%) were 75 years or older. In most studies, severe myelosuppression was more frequent in elderly patients; in some studies, severe neuropathy was more common in elderly patients. In 2 clinical studies in NSCLC, the elderly patients treated with paclitaxel had a higher incidence of cardiovascular events. Estimates of efficacy appeared similar in elderly patients and in younger patients; however, comparative efficacy cannot be determined with confidence due to the small number of elderly patients studied. In a study of first-line treatment of ovarian cancer, elderly patients had a lower median survival than younger patients, but no other efficacy parameters favored the younger group. <span class="Bold">TABLE 9</span> presents the incidences of Grade IV neutropenia and severe neuropathy in clinical studies according to age.</p><p class="First">Patients (n/total [%])</p><p class="First">Neutropenia<br/>

812 patients with solid tumors treated with single-agent paclitaxel in clinical studies. Toxicities that occurred with greater severity or frequency in previously untreated patients with ovarian carcinoma or NSCLC who received paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin or in patients with breast cancer who received paclitaxel after doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide in the adjuvant setting and that occurred with a difference that was clinically significant in these populations are also described. The frequency and severity of important adverse events for the Phase 3 ovarian carcinoma, breast carcinoma, NSCLC, and the Phase 2 Kaposi’s sarcoma studies are presented above in tabular form by treatment arm. In addition, rare events have been reported from postmarketing experience or from other clinical studies. The frequency and severity of adverse events have been generally similar for patients receiving paclitaxel for the treatment of ovarian, breast, or lung carcinoma or Kaposi’s sarcoma, but patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma may have more frequent and severe hematologic toxicity, infections (including opportunistic infections, see <span class="Bold">TABLE 16</span>), and febrile neutropenia. These patients require a lower dose intensity and supportive care (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES, AIDS-Related Kaposi’s Sarcoma</span>). Toxicities that were observed only in or were noted to have occurred with greater severity in the population with Kaposi’s sarcoma and that occurred with a difference that was clinically significant in this population are described. Elevated liver function tests and renal toxicity have a higher incidence in KS patients as compared to patients with solid tumors.</p><p class="First">Bone marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel. Neutropenia, the most important hematologic toxicity, was dose and schedule dependent and was generally rapidly reversible. Among patients treated in the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study with a 3 hour infusion, neutrophil counts declined below 500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> in 14% of the patients treated with a dose of 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> compared to 27% at a dose of 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> (p = 0.05). In the same study, severe neutropenia (&lt; 500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>) was more frequent with the 24 hour than with the 3 hour infusion; infusion duration had a greater impact on myelosuppression than dose. Neutropenia did not appear to increase with cumulative exposure and did not appear to be more frequent nor more severe for patients previously treated with radiation therapy.</p><p>In the study where paclitaxel was administered to patients with ovarian carcinoma at a dose of 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/24 hours in combination with cisplatin versus the control arm of cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin, the incidences of grade IV neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were significantly greater in the paclitaxel plus cisplatin arm than in the control arm. Grade IV neutropenia occurred in 81% on the paclitaxel plus cisplatin arm versus 58% on the cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin arm, and febrile neutropenia occurred in 15% and 4% respectively. On the paclitaxel/cisplatin arm, there were 35/1074 (3%) courses with fever in which Grade IV neutropenia was reported at some time during the course. When paclitaxel followed by cisplatin was administered to patients with advanced NSCLC in the ECOG study, the incidences of Grade IV neutropenia were 74% (paclitaxel 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/24 hours followed by cisplatin) and 65% (paclitaxel 250 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/24 hours followed by cisplatin and G-CSF) compared with 55% in patients who received cisplatin/etoposide.</p><p>Fever was frequent (12% of all treatment courses). Infectious episodes occurred in 30% of all patients and 9% of all courses; these episodes were fatal in 1% of all patients, and included sepsis, pneumonia and peritonitis. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, infectious episodes were reported in 20% and 26% of the patients treated with a dose of 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> or 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given as 3 hour infusions, respectively. Urinary tract infections and upper respiratory tract infections were the most frequently reported infectious complications. In the immunosuppressed patient population with advanced HIV disease and poor-risk AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, 61% of the patients reported at least one opportunistic infection (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES, AIDS-Related Kaposi’s Sarcoma</span>). The use of supportive therapy, including G-CSF, is recommended for patients who have experienced severe neutropenia (see <span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</span>).</p><p>Thrombocytopenia was reported. Twenty percent of the patients experienced a drop in their platelet count below 100,000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> at least once while on treatment; 7% had a platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> at the time of their worst nadir. Bleeding episodes were reported in 4% of all courses and by 14% of all patients, but most of the hemorrhagic episodes were localized and the frequency of these events was unrelated to the paclitaxel dose and schedule. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, bleeding episodes were reported in 10% of the patients; no patients treated with the 3 hour infusion received platelet transfusions. In the adjuvant breast carcinoma trial, the incidence of severe thrombocytopenia and platelet transfusions increased with higher doses of doxorubicin.</p><p>Anemia (Hb &lt; 11 g/dL) was observed in 78% of all patients and was severe (Hb &lt; 8 g/dL) in 16% of the cases. No consistent relationship between dose or schedule and the frequency of anemia was observed. Among all patients with normal baseline hemoglobin, 69% became anemic on study but only 7% had severe anemia. Red cell transfusions were required in 25% of all patients and in 12% of those with normal baseline hemoglobin levels.</p><p class="First">All patients received premedication prior to paclitaxel administration (see <span class="Bold">WARNINGS</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Hypersensitivity Reactions</span>). The frequency and severity of HSRs were not affected by the dose or schedule of paclitaxel administration. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, the 3 hour infusion was not associated with a greater increase in HSRs when compared to the 24 hour infusion. Hypersensitivity reactions were observed in 20% of all courses and in 41% of all patients. These reactions were severe in less than 2% of the patients and 1% of the courses. No severe reactions were observed after course 3 and severe symptoms occurred generally within the first hour of paclitaxel infusion. The most frequent symptoms observed during these severe reactions were dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and tachycardia. Abdominal pain, pain in the extremities, diaphoresis, and hypertension were also noted.</p><p>The minor hypersensitivity reactions consisted mostly of flushing (28%), rash (12%), hypotension (4%), dyspnea (2%), tachycardia (2%), and hypertension (1%). The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions remained relatively stable during the entire treatment period.</p><p>Chills, shock, and back pain in association with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.</p><p class="First">Hypotension, during the first 3 hours of infusion, occurred in 12% of all patients and 3% of all courses administered. Bradycardia, during the first 3 hours of infusion, occurred in 3% of all patients and 1% of all courses. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, neither dose nor schedule had an effect on the frequency of hypotension and bradycardia. These vital sign changes most often caused no symptoms and required neither specific therapy nor treatment discontinuation. The frequency of hypotension and bradycardia were not influenced by prior anthracycline therapy.</p><p>Significant cardiovascular events possibly related to single-agent paclitaxel occurred in approximately 1% of all patients. These events included syncope, rhythm abnormalities, hypertension, and venous thrombosis. One of the patients with syncope treated with paclitaxel at 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> over 24 hours had progressive hypotension and died. The arrhythmias included asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, and complete AV block requiring pacemaker placement. Among patients with NSCLC treated with paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin in the Phase 3 study, significant cardiovascular events occurred in 12 to 13%. This apparent increase in cardiovascular events is possibly due to an increase in cardiovascular risk factors in patients with lung cancer.</p><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were common among patients at baseline. ECG abnormalities on study did not usually result in symptoms, were not dose-limiting, and required no intervention. ECG abnormalities were noted in 23% of all patients. Among patients with a normal ECG prior to study entry, 14% of all patients developed an abnormal tracing while on study. The most frequently reported ECG modifications were non-specific repolarization abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, and premature beats. Among patients with normal ECGs at baseline, prior therapy with anthracyclines did not influence the frequency of ECG abnormalities.</p><p>Cases of myocardial infarction have been reported. Congestive heart failure, including cardiac dysfunction and reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction or ventricular failure, has been reported typically in patients who have received other chemotherapy, notably anthracyclines (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</span>).</p><p>Atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia have been reported.</p><p class="First">Interstitial pneumonia, lung fibrosis, and pulmonary embolism have been reported. Radiation pneumonitis has been reported in patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy.</p><p>Pleural effusion and respiratory failure have been reported.</p><p class="First">The assessment of neurologic toxicity was conducted differently among the studies as evident from the data reported in each individual study (see <span class="Bold">TABLES 10</span>to<span class="Bold">16</span>). Moreover, the frequency and severity of neurologic manifestations were influenced by prior and/or concomitant therapy with neurotoxic agents.</p><p>In general, the frequency and severity of neurologic manifestations were dose-dependent in patients receiving single-agent paclitaxel. Peripheral neuropathy was observed in 60% of all patients (3% severe) and in 52% (2% severe) of the patients without pre-existing neuropathy. The frequency of peripheral neuropathy increased with cumulative dose. Paresthesia commonly occurs in the form of hyperesthesia. Neurologic symptoms were observed in 27% of the patients after the first course of treatment and in 34 to 51% from course 2 to 10. Peripheral neuropathy was the cause of paclitaxel discontinuation in 1% of all patients. Sensory symptoms have usually improved or resolved within several months of paclitaxel discontinuation. Pre-existing neuropathies resulting from prior therapies are not a contraindication for paclitaxel therapy.</p><p>In the Intergroup first-line ovarian carcinoma study (see <span class="Bold">TABLE 11</span>), neurotoxicity included reports of neuromotor and neurosensory events. The regimen with paclitaxel 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given by 3 hour infusion plus cisplatin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> resulted in greater incidence and severity of neurotoxicity than the regimen containing cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, 87% (21% severe) versus 52% (2% severe), respectively. The duration of grade III or IV neurotoxicity cannot be determined with precision for the Intergroup study since the resolution dates of adverse events were not collected in the case report forms for this trial and complete follow-up documentation was available only in a minority of these patients. In the GOG first-line ovarian carcinoma study, neurotoxicity was reported as peripheral neuropathy. The regimen with paclitaxel 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given by 24 hour infusion plus cisplatin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> resulted in an incidence of neurotoxicity that was similar to the regimen containing cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin, 25% (3% severe) versus 20% (0% severe), respectively. Cross-study comparison of neurotoxicity in the Intergroup and GOG trials suggests that when paclitaxel is given in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>, the incidence of severe neurotoxicity is more common at a paclitaxel dose of 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given by 3 hour infusion (21%) than at a dose of 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given by 24 hour infusion (3%).</p><p>In patients with NSCLC, administration of paclitaxel followed by cisplatin resulted in a greater incidence of severe neurotoxicity compared to the incidence in patients with ovarian or breast cancer treated with single-agent paclitaxel. Severe neurosensory symptoms were noted in 13% of NSCLC patients receiving paclitaxel 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> by 24 hour infusion followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> and 8% of NSCLC patients receiving cisplatin/etoposide (see <span class="Bold">TABLE 15</span>).</p><p>Other than peripheral neuropathy, serious neurologic events following paclitaxel administration have been rare (&lt; 1%) and have included grand mal seizures, syncope, ataxia, and neuroencephalopathy.</p><p>Autonomic neuropathy resulting in paralytic ileus has been reported. Optic nerve and/or visual disturbances (scintillating scotomata) have also been reported, particularly in patients who have received higher doses than those recommended. These effects generally have been reversible. However, reports in the literature of abnormal visual evoked potentials in patients have suggested persistent optic nerve damage. Postmarketing reports of ototoxicity (hearing loss and tinnitus) have also been received.</p><p>Convulsions, dizziness, and headache have been reported.</p><p class="First">There was no consistent relationship between dose or schedule of paclitaxel and the frequency or severity of arthralgia/myalgia. Sixty percent of all patients treated experienced arthralgia/myalgia; 8% experienced severe symptoms. The symptoms were usually transient, occurred 2 or 3 days after paclitaxel administration, and resolved within a few days. The frequency and severity of musculoskeletal symptoms remained unchanged throughout the treatment period.</p><p class="First">No relationship was observed between liver function abnormalities and either dose or schedule of paclitaxel administration. Among patients with normal baseline liver function 7%, 22%, and 19% had elevations in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and AST (SGOT), respectively. Prolonged exposure to paclitaxel was not associated with cumulative hepatic toxicity.</p><p>Hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death have been reported.</p><p class="First">Among the patients treated for Kaposi’s sarcoma with paclitaxel, 5 patients had renal toxicity of grade III or IV severity. One patient with suspected HIV nephropathy of grade IV severity had to discontinue therapy. The other 4 patients had renal insufficiency with reversible elevations of serum creatinine.</p><p>Patients with gynecological cancers treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin may have an increased risk of renal failure with the combination therapy of paclitaxel and cisplatin in gynecological cancers as compared to cisplatin alone.</p><p class="First">Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis were reported by 52%, 38%, and 31% of all patients, respectively. These manifestations were usually mild to moderate. Mucositis was schedule dependent and occurred more frequently with the 24 hour than with the 3 hour infusion.</p><p>In patients with poor-risk AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis were reported by 69%, 79%, and 28% of patients, respectively. One-third of patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma complained of diarrhea prior to study start (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES, AIDS-Related Kaposi’s Sarcoma</span>).</p><p>In the first-line Phase 3 ovarian carcinoma studies, the incidence of nausea and vomiting when paclitaxel was administered in combination with cisplatin appeared to be greater compared with the database for single-agent paclitaxel in ovarian and breast carcinoma. In addition, diarrhea of any grade was reported more frequently compared to the control arm, but there was no difference for severe diarrhea in these studies.</p><p>Intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, pancreatitis, ischemic colitis, dehydration, esophagitis, constipation, and ascites have been reported. Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis), despite the coadministration of G-CSF, was observed in patients treated with paclitaxel alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.</p><p class="First">Injection site reactions, including reactions secondary to extravasation, were usually mild and consisted of erythema, tenderness, skin discoloration, or swelling at the injection site. These reactions have been observed more frequently with the 24 hour infusion than with the 3 hour infusion. Recurrence of skin reactions at a site of previous extravasation following administration of paclitaxel at a different site, i.e., “recall,” has been reported.</p><p>More severe events such as phlebitis, cellulitis, induration, skin exfoliation, necrosis, and fibrosis have been reported. In some cases the onset of the injection site reaction either occurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed by a week to 10 days.</p><p>A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time. Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration.</p><p class="First">Alopecia was observed in almost all (87%) of the patients. Transient skin changes due to paclitaxel-related hypersensitivity reactions have been observed, but no other skin toxicities were significantly associated with paclitaxel administration. Nail changes (changes in pigmentation or discoloration of nail bed) were uncommon (2%). Edema was reported in 21% of all patients (17% of those without baseline edema); only 1% had severe edema and none of these patients required treatment discontinuation. Edema was most commonly focal and disease-related. Edema was observed in 5% of all courses for patients with normal baseline and did not increase with time on study.</p><p>Skin abnormalities related to radiation recall as well as maculopapular rash, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. In postmarketing experience, diffuse edema, thickening, and sclerosing of the skin have been reported following paclitaxel administration. Paclitaxel has been reported to exacerbate signs and symptoms of scleroderma.</p><p>Reports of asthenia and malaise have been received as part of the continuing surveillance of paclitaxel safety. In the Phase 3 trial of paclitaxel 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> over 24 hours in combination with cisplatin as first-line therapy of ovarian cancer, asthenia was reported in 17% of the patients, significantly greater than the 10% incidence observed in the control arm of cyclophosphamide/cisplatin.</p><p>Conjunctivitis, increased lacrimation, anorexia, confusional state, photopsia, visual floaters, vertigo, and increase in blood creatinine have been reported.</p><p class="First">Upon inhalation, dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat, and nausea have been reported. Following topical exposure, events have included tingling, burning, and redness.</p><p>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TEVA USA, PHARMACOVIGILANCE at 1-866-832-8537 or drug.safety@tevapharm.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">There is no known antidote for paclitaxel injection overdosage. The primary anticipated complications of overdosage would consist of bone marrow suppression, peripheral neurotoxicity, and mucositis. Overdoses in pediatric patients may be associated with acute ethanol toxicity (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use</span>).</p><h2>Paclitaxel Concentrate Injection Dosage and Administration</h2><p class="First">Note: Contact of the undiluted concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended. In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate], which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel injection solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets.</p><p>All patients should be premedicated prior to paclitaxel injection administration in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions. Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg PO administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel injection, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel injection, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) IV 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel injection.</p><p>For patients with <span class="Bold">carcinoma of the ovary</span>, the following regimens are recommended (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES, Ovarian Carcinoma</span>):</p><ul class="Circle">
<li>Paclitaxel injection administered intravenously over 3 hours at a dose of 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>; or</li>
<li>Paclitaxel injection administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</li>
</ul><p>For patients with <span class="Bold">carcinoma of the breast</span>, the following is recommended<br/>
(see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES, Breast Carcinoma</span>):</p><p>For patients with <span class="Bold">non-small cell lung carcinoma</span>, the recommended regimen, given every 3 weeks, is paclitaxel injection administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> followed by cisplatin, 75 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>.</p><p>For patients with <span class="Bold">AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma</span>, paclitaxel injection administered at a dose of 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks or at a dose of 100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> given intravenously over 3 hours every 2 weeks is recommended (dose intensity 45 to 50 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span>/week). In the 2 clinical trials evaluating these schedules (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL STUDIES, AIDS-Related Kaposi’s Sarcoma</span>), the former schedule (135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 3 weeks) was more toxic than the latter. In addition, all patients with low performance status were treated with the latter schedule (100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> every 2 weeks).</p><p>Based upon the immunosuppression in patients with advanced HIV disease, the following modifications are recommended in these patients:</p><p>For the therapy of patients with solid tumors (ovary, breast, and NSCLC), courses of paclitaxel injection should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 1500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> and the platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. Paclitaxel injection should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma if the baseline or subsequent neutrophil count is less than 1000 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span>. Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil &lt; 500 cells/mm<span class="Sup">3</span> for a week or longer) or severe peripheral neuropathy during paclitaxel injection therapy should have dosage reduced by 20% for subsequent courses of paclitaxel injection. The incidence of neurotoxicity and the severity of neutropenia increase with dose.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Precautions</h3><p class="First">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling paclitaxel. The use of gloves is recommended. If paclitaxel solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Following topical exposure, events have included tingling, burning and redness. If paclitaxel contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Upon inhalation, dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat, and nausea have been reported.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity, particularly grade III–IV myelosuppression (see <span class="Bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</span> and <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Hepatic</span>). Recommendations for dosage adjustment for the first course of therapy are shown in <span class="Bold">TABLE 17</span> for both 3 and 24 hour infusions. Further dose reduction in subsequent courses should be based on individual tolerance. Patients should be monitored closely for the development of profound myelosuppression.</p><p class="First">Degree of Hepatic Impairment</p><p class="First">Transaminase Levels</p><p class="First">Bilirubin Levels<span class="Sup">b</span></p><p class="First">Recommended Paclitaxel Injection Dose<span class="Sup">c</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">24 hour infusion</span></p><p class="First">&lt; 2 × ULN</p><p class="First">and</p><p class="First">≤ 1.5 mg/dL</p><p class="First">135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">2 to &lt; 10 × ULN</p><p class="First">and</p><p class="First">≤ 1.5 mg/dL</p><p class="First">100 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">&lt; 10 × ULN</p><p class="First">and</p><p class="First">1.6 to 7.5 mg/dL</p><p class="First">50 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">≥ 10 × ULN</p><p class="First">or</p><p class="First">&gt; 7.5 mg/dL</p><p class="First">Not recommended</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">3 hour infusion</span></p><p class="First">&lt; 10 × ULN</p><p class="First">and</p><p class="First">≤ 1.25 × ULN</p><p class="First">175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">&lt; 10 × ULN</p><p class="First">and</p><p class="First">1.26 to 2 × ULN</p><p class="First">135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">&lt; 10 × ULN</p><p class="First">and</p><p class="First">2.01 to 5 × ULN</p><p class="First">90 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span></p><p class="First">≥ 10 × ULN</p><p class="First">or</p><p class="First">&gt; 5 × ULN</p><p class="First">Not recommended</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">a</span> These recommendations are based on dosages for patients without hepatic impairment of 135 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> over 24 hours or 175 mg/m<span class="Sup">2</span> over 3 hours; data are not available to make dose adjustment recommendations for other regimens (e.g., for AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma).</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">b</span> Differences in criteria for bilirubin levels between the 3 and 24 hour infusion are due to differences in clinical trial design.</p><p class="First"><span class="Sup">c</span> Dosage recommendations are for the first course of therapy; further dose reduction in subsequent courses should be based on individual tolerance.</p><h3>Preparation and Administration Precautions</h3><p class="First">Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.<span class="Sup">1–4</span> To minimize the risk of dermal exposure, always wear impervious gloves when handling vials containing paclitaxel injection. If paclitaxel injection solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Following topical exposure, events have included tingling, burning, and redness. If paclitaxel injection contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Upon inhalation, dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat, and nausea have been reported.</p><p>Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration (see <span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS, Injection Site Reaction</span>).</p><h3>Preparation for Intravenous Administration</h3><p class="First">Paclitaxel injection must be diluted prior to infusion. Paclitaxel injection should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose in Ringer’s Injection to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 mg/mL. The solutions are physically and chemically stable for up to 27 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 25°C) and room lighting conditions. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</p><p>Upon preparation, solutions may show haziness, which is attributed to the formulation vehicle. No significant losses in potency have been noted following simulated delivery of the solution through IV tubing containing an in-line (0.22 micron) filter.</p><p>Data collected for the presence of the extractable plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate] show that levels increase with time and concentration when dilutions are prepared in PVC containers. Consequently, the use of plasticized PVC containers and administration sets is not recommended. Paclitaxel injection solutions should be prepared and stored in glass, polypropylene, or polyolefin containers. Non-PVC containing administration sets, such as those which are polyethylene-lined, should be used.</p><p>Paclitaxel injection should be administered through an in-line filter with a microporous membrane not greater than 0.22 microns. Use of filter devices such as IVEX-2<span class="Sup">®</span> filters which incorporate short inlet and outlet PVC-coated tubing has not resulted in significant leaching of DEHP.</p><p>The Chemo Dispensing Pin™ device or similar devices with spikes should not be used with vials of paclitaxel injection since they can cause the stopper to collapse resulting in loss of sterile integrity of the paclitaxel injection solution.</p><h3>Stability</h3><p class="First">Unopened vials of paclitaxel injection are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored between 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F), in the original package. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product. Upon refrigeration, components in the paclitaxel injection vial may precipitate, but will redissolve upon reaching room temperature with little or no agitation. There is no impact on product quality under these circumstances. If the solution remains cloudy or if an insoluble precipitate is noted, the vial should be discarded. Solutions for infusion prepared as recommended are stable at ambient temperature (approximately 25°C) and lighting conditions for up to 27 hours.</p><h2>How is Paclitaxel Concentrate Injection Supplied</h2><p class="First">Paclitaxel Injection USP is available as follows:</p><p class="First">NDC 0703-<span class="Bold">3213</span>-81</p><p class="First">30 mg/5 mL</p><p class="First">Multidose vial individually packaged in a carton.</p><p class="First">NDC 0703-<span class="Bold">3216</span>-81</p><p class="First">100 mg/16.7 mL</p><p class="First">Multidose vial individually packaged in a carton.</p><p class="First">NDC 0703-<span class="Bold">3218</span>-81</p><p class="First">300 mg/50 mL</p><p class="First">Multidose vial individually packaged in a carton.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p class="First">Store the vials in original cartons at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].

Cell division and growth are necessary for the human body to perform its functions and to repair itself, when necessary. Cancer cells are different from normal cells because they are not able to control their own growth. The reasons for this abnormal growth are not yet fully understood.</p><p>A tumor is a mass of unhealthy cells that are dividing and growing fast and in an uncontrolled way. When a tumor invades surrounding healthy body tissue, it is known as a malignant tumor. A malignant tumor can spread (metastasize) from its original site to other parts of the body if not found and treated early.</p><p>*Polyoxyl 35 castor oil is further purified by Corden Pharma before use.</p><p>Rev.
