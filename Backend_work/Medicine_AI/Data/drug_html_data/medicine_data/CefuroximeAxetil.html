In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</p><h2>Cefuroxime Axetil Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Important Administration Instructions</h3><ul>
<li>Cefuroxime Axetil tablets and Cefuroxime Axetil for oral suspension are not bioequivalent and are therefore not substitutable on a milligram-per-milligram basis <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)].</span></li>
<li>Administer Cefuroxime Axetil tablets as described in the appropriate dosage guidelines <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)].</span></li>
<li>Administer Cefuroxime Axetil tablets with or without food.</li>
<li>Pediatric patients (aged 13 years and older) who cannot swallow the Cefuroxime Axetil tablets whole should receive Cefuroxime Axetil for oral suspension because the tablet has a strong, persistent bitter taste when crushed <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)].</span></li>

There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime Axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Cefuroxime Axetil or other β-lactam antibacterial drugs <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications ( 4)].</span> Before initiating therapy with Cefuroxime Axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue Cefuroxime Axetil and institute appropriate therapy.</p><h3>Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea</h3><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile-</span>associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cefuroxime Axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>.</p><p><span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p><p>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span> may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of <span class="Italics">C. difficile</span>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</p><h3>Potential for Microbial Overgrowth</h3><p class="First">The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy.</p><h3>Development of Drug-resistant Bacteria</h3><p class="First">Prescribing Cefuroxime Axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p><h3>Interference with Glucose Tests</h3><p class="First">A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving Cefuroxime Axetil <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.3)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following serious and otherwise important adverse reaction is described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label:</p><p>Anaphylactic Reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1)]</span></p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold">Tablets</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens with 7 to 10 Days’ Duration</span>: In multiple-dose clinical trials, 912 subjects were treated with Cefuroxime Axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). It is noted that 125 mg twice daily is not an approved dosage. Twenty (2.2%) subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 subjects who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of subjects treated with Cefuroxime Axetil who discontinued study drug because of adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions increased with the higher recommended doses.</p><p>The adverse reactions in Table 5 are for subjects (n = 912) treated with Cefuroxime Axetil in multiple-dose clinical trials.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Cefuroxime Axetil</span><br/>

Angioedema, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Drugs that Reduce Gastric Acidity</h3><p class="First">Drugs that reduce gastric acidity may result in a lower bioavailability of Cefuroxime Axetil compared with administration in the fasting state. Administration of drugs that reduce gastric acidity may negate the food effect of increased absorption of Cefuroxime Axetil when administered in the postprandial state. Administer Cefuroxime Axetil at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short-acting antacids. Histamine-2 (H <span class="Sub">2</span>) antagonists and proton pump inhibitors should be avoided.</p><h3>Probenecid</h3><p class="First">Concomitant administration of probenecid with Cefuroxime Axetil tablets increases serum concentrations of cefuroxime <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)].</span> Coadministration of probenecid with Cefuroxime Axetil is not recommended.</p><h3>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions</h3><p class="First">A false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests (e.g., Benedict's or Fehling's solution), but not with enzyme-based tests for glycosuria. As a false-negative result may occur in the ferricyanide test, it is recommended that either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase method be used to determine blood/plasma glucose levels in patients receiving Cefuroxime Axetil. The presence of cefuroxime does not interfere with the assay of serum and urine creatinine by the alkaline picrate method.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Available data from published epidemiologic studies, case series, and case reports over several decades with cephalosporin use, including Cefuroxime Axetil, in pregnant women have not established drug-associated risks of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span></p><p>In studies in pregnant mice and rats administered oral Cefuroxime Axetil during organogenesis at 14 and 9 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area, respectively, there were no adverse developmental outcomes <span class="Italics">(see Data).</span> The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk:</span> Maternal gonorrhea may be associated with preterm birth, low neonatal birth weight, chorioamnionitis, intrauterine growth restriction, small for gestational age, and premature rupture of membranes. Perinatal transmission of gonorrhea to the offspring can result in infant blindness, joint infections, and bloodstream infections.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Human Data:</span> While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, published data from epidemiologic studies, case series, and case reports over several decades have not identified an association with cephalosporin use (including Cefuroxime Axetil) during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data:</span> Studies performed with oral Cefuroxime Axetil administered to pregnant mice during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 through 16) at doses up to 3,200 mg/kg/day (14 times the MRHD based on body surface area); and in rats dosed during organogenesis and lactation (Gestation Days 7 through 16 and Gestation Days 17 through Lactation Day 21, respectively) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (9 times the MRHD based on body surface area) have revealed no adverse developmental outcomes.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span><br/>
Based on several published case reports describing multiple lactating women who received cefuroxime via intravenous, intramuscular, and oral routes, cefuroxime is present in human milk. The highest maternal milk concentration described occurred in lactating women 8 hours after an intramuscular administration of cefuroxime 750 mg. Allowing for an infant milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the estimated breastfed infant dose would be less than 1% of the adult dose. No data are available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for cefuroxime and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from cefuroxime or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Cefuroxime Axetil have been established for pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years for acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis based upon its approval in adults. Use of Cefuroxime Axetil in pediatric patients is supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data in adults and pediatric patients, and by clinical and microbiological data from adequate and well-controlled trials of the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults and of acute otitis media with effusion in pediatric patients. It is also supported by postmarketing adverse events surveillance. <span class="Italics">[See Indications and Usage ( 1), Dosage and Administration ( 2), Adverse Reactions ( 6), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)].</span></p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of subjects who received Cefuroxime Axetil in 20 clinical trials, 375 were aged 65 and older while 151 were aged 75 and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger adult subjects. Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Cefuroxime is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Reducing the dosage of Cefuroxime Axetil is recommended for adult patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min) <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Overdosage of cephalosporins can cause cerebral irritation leading to convulsions or encephalopathy. Serum levels of cefuroxime can be reduced by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.</p><h2>Cefuroxime Axetil Description</h2><p class="First">Cefuroxime Axetil tablets, USP contain cefuroxime as Cefuroxime Axetil.

Despite this difference in absorption, the clinical and bacteriologic responses of subjects were independent of food intake at the time of tablet administration in 2 trials where this was assessed.</p><p>All pharmacokinetic and clinical effectiveness and safety trials in pediatric subjects using the suspension formulation were conducted in the fed state. No data are available on the absorption kinetics of the suspension formulation when administered to fasted pediatric subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Lack of Bioequivalence:</span></span> Oral suspension was not bioequivalent to tablets when tested in healthy adults. The tablet and oral suspension formulations are NOT substitutable on a milligram-per-milligram basis. The area under the curve for the suspension averaged 91% of that for the tablet, and the peak plasma concentration for the suspension averaged 71% of the peak plasma concentration of the tablets. Therefore, the safety and effectiveness of both the tablet and oral suspension formulations were established in separate clinical trials.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></span><br/>
Cefuroxime is distributed throughout the extracellular fluids. Approximately 50% of serum cefuroxime is bound to protein.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Metabolism</span></span><br/>
The axetil moiety is metabolized to acetaldehyde and acetic acid.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Excretion</span></span><br/>
Cefuroxime is excreted unchanged in the urine; in adults, approximately 50% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine within 12 hours. The pharmacokinetics of cefuroxime in pediatric subjects have not been studied. Until further data are available, the renal elimination of Cefuroxime Axetil established in adults should not be extrapolated to pediatric subjects.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></span><br/>
<span class="Italics">Patients with Renal Impairment:</span> In a trial of 28 adults with normal renal function or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min), the elimination half-life was prolonged in relation to severity of renal impairment. Prolongation of the dosage interval is recommended in adult patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Geriatric Patients:</span></span> In a trial of 20 elderly subjects (mean age = 83.9 years) having a mean creatinine clearance of 34.9 mL/min, the mean serum elimination half-life was prolonged to 3.5 hours; however, despite the lower elimination of cefuroxime in geriatric patients, dosage adjustment based on age is not necessary <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5)].</span></p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></span><br/>
Concomitant administration of probenecid with Cefuroxime Axetil tablets increases the cefuroxime area under the serum concentration versus time curve and maximum serum concentration by 50% and 21%, respectively <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions ( 7.2)].</span></p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></span><br/>
Cefuroxime Axetil is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cefuroxime Axetil has activity in the presence of some β-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></span><br/>
Resistance to Cefuroxime Axetil is primarily through hydrolysis by β-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), decreased permeability, and the presence of bacterial efflux pumps.</p><p>Susceptibility to Cefuroxime Axetil will vary with geography and time; local susceptibility data should be consulted, if available. Beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) isolates of <span class="Italics">H. influenzae</span> should be considered resistant to Cefuroxime Axetil.</p><p><span class="Bold">Antimicrobial Activity</span><br/>
Cefuroxime Axetil has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and in clinical infections <span class="Italics">[see Indications and Usage ( 1)]:</span></p><p><span class="Italics"><span class="Bold">Aerobic Bacteria:</span></span><br/>

Positive results were obtained in an <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> chromosome aberration assay; however, negative results were found in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> micronucleus test at doses up to 1.5 g/kg. Fertility studies in rats (males dosed for 70 days prior to and through mating; females dosed 21 days prior to mating through lactation) at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day (9 times the MRHD based on body surface area) have revealed no adverse effects on fertility.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><h3>Acute Bacterial Maxillary Sinusitis</h3><p class="First">One adequate and well-controlled trial was performed in subjects with acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. In this trial, each subject had a maxillary sinus aspirate collected by sinus puncture before treatment was initiated for presumptive acute bacterial sinusitis. All subjects had radiographic and clinical evidence of acute maxillary sinusitis. In the trial, the clinical effectiveness of Cefuroxime Axetil in treating acute maxillary sinusitis was comparable to an oral antimicrobial agent containing a specific β-lactamase inhibitor. However, microbiology data demonstrated Cefuroxime Axetil to be effective in treating acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis due only to <span class="Italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> or non-β-lactamase–producing <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span>. Insufficient numbers of β-lactamase–producing <span class="Italics">Haemophilus influenzae</span> and <span class="Italics">Moraxella catarrhalis</span> isolates were obtained in this trial to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of Cefuroxime Axetil in treating acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis due to, these 2 organisms.</p><p>This trial randomized 317 adult subjects,132 subjects in the U.S. and 185 subjects in South America.

All subjects presented with physician-documented erythema migrans, with or without systemic manifestations of infection. Subjects were assessed at 1 month posttreatment for success in treating early Lyme disease (Part I) and at 1 year posttreatment for success in preventing the progression to the sequelae of late Lyme disease (Part II).</p><p>A total of 355 adult subjects (181 treated with Cefuroxime Axetil and 174 treated with doxycycline) were randomized in the 2 trials, with diagnosis of early Lyme disease confirmed in 79% (281/355). The clinical diagnosis of early Lyme disease in these subjects was validated by 1) blinded expert reading of photographs, when available, of the pretreatment erythema migrans skin lesion, and 2) serologic confirmation (using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and immunoblot assay [“Western” blot]) of the presence of antibodies specific to <span class="Italics">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. The efficacy data in Table 14 are specific to this “validated” patient subset, while the safety data below reflect the entire patient population for the 2 trials.

Inform patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials, and it usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, advise patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Crushing Tablets</span></span><br/>
Instruct patients to swallow the tablet whole, without crushing the tablet. Patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole should receive the oral suspension.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold">Drug Resistance</span></span><br/>
Inform patients that antibacterial drugs, including Cefuroxime Axetil, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Cefuroxime Axetil is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, inform patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefuroxime Axetil or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</p><p>Alkem Laboratories Limited<br/>
