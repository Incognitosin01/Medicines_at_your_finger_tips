To assure proper dosage, weigh animal prior to treatment. It is not necessary to withhold food prior to treatment. Dogs usually find this dewormer very palatable and will lick the dose from the bowl willingly. If there is reluctance to accept the dose, mix in a small quantity of dog food to encourage consumption. It is recommended that dogs maintained under conditions of constant exposure to worm infestation should have a follow-up fecal exam within 2–4 weeks after first treatment. If your dog looks or acts sick, consult your veterinarian before treatment.</p><p>For maximum control and prevention of reinfestation, it is recommended that puppies be treated at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of age. Lactating bitches should be treated 2–3 weeks after whelping. Adult dogs kept in heavily contaminated quarters may be treated at monthly intervals to prevent <span class="Italics">T. canis</span> reinfestation.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Distributed by:</span><br/>
