</ul><p>Therapeutic Class: Antiestrogen</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for Nolvadex</h2><p>Tamoxifen is used to treat certain types of breast cancer (eg, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body [metastatic], early stage estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer after surgery and radiation treatment). It is also used to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in adult women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after breast surgery and radiation treatment.</p><p>Tamoxifen is also used to reduce the risk for breast cancer in women with a high chance of getting it. The following are risk factors that may increase your risk of developing breast cancer:</p><ul>
<li>If you have close family members (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer.</li>
<li>If you have ever had a breast biopsy or if high-risk changes in your breast(s) have been found from a breast biopsy.</li>
<li>If you have never been pregnant or if your first pregnancy occurred at a late age.</li>
<li>If your first menstrual period occurred at an early age.</li>
</ul><p>Female hormones called estrogen, that occur naturally in the body can increase the growth of some breast cancers. Tamoxifen works by blocking the effects of estrogen in the body.</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Nolvadex</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
