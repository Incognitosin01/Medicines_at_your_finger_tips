Hemophilia B, or Christmas disease, is an X-linked inherited disorder of blood coagulation characterized by insufficient or abnormal synthesis of the clotting protein factor IX. Factor IX is a vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor which is synthesized in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Activated factor IX (IXa), in combination with factor VII:C activates factor X to Xa, resulting ultimately in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and the formation of a fibrin clot. The infusion of exogenous factor IX to replace the deficiency present in hemophilia B temporarily restores hemostasis.</p><h3>Half-Life Elimination</h3><p>IX component: ~21 to 25 hours </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Factor IX deficiency:</b> Prevention and control of bleeding in patients with hemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency or Christmas disease)</p><p>Limitations of use: <b>Contains nondetectable levels of factors II, VII, and X</b>.

When clinical response is suboptimal, the patient has reached a specified number of exposure days, or patient is to undergo surgical procedure, screen for inhibitors. Patients with severe hemophilia compared to those with mild or moderate hemophilia are more likely to develop inhibitors (WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><p>• Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions have been reported with use. Delayed reactions (up to 20 days after infusion) in previously untreated patients may also occur. Due to potential for allergic reactions, the initial ~10 to 20 administrations should be performed under appropriate medical supervision. Hypersensitivity reactions may be associated with factor IX inhibitor development; patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for factor IX inhibitors (WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><p>• Thrombotic events: Observe closely for signs or symptoms of intravascular coagulation or thrombosis; risk is generally associated with the use of factor IX complex concentrates (containing therapeutic amounts of additional factors); however, potential risk exists with use of factor IX products (containing only factor IX). Use with caution when administering to patients with liver disease, postoperatively, neonates, or patients at risk of thromboembolic phenomena, disseminated intravascular coagulation or patients with signs of fibrinolysis due to the potential risk of thromboembolic complications.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Hepatic impairment: Use with extreme caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to the risk of thromboembolic complications.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues: </i></b></p><p>• Human plasma: Product of human plasma. Despite purification methods (AlphaNine SD - solvent detergent treated/virus filtered; Mononine - virus filtered); products may potentially contain infectious agents (eg, viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [vCJD] agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD] agent) that could transmit disease. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer.</p><p>• Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer’s labeling.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: Contains <b>nondetectable levels of factors II, VII, and X.</b> Therefore, <b>NOT INDICATED</b> for replacement therapy of any other clotting factor besides factor IX. In addition, factor IX concentrate is <b>NOT INDICATED </b>for reversal of anticoagulation due to either vitamin K antagonists or other anticoagulants (eg, dabigatran), hemophilia A patients with factor VIII inhibitors, or patients in a hemorrhagic state caused by reduced production of liver-dependent coagulation factors (eg, hepatitis, cirrhosis).</p><p>• Clinical response: Response to factor IX administration may vary. If bleeding is not controlled with the recommended dose, determine plasma level of factor IX and follow with a sufficient dose to achieve satisfactory clinical response. If plasma levels of factor IX fail to increase as expected or bleeding continues, suspect the presence of an inhibitor; test as appropriate.</p><p>• Immune tolerance induction: Safety and efficacy have not been established in immune tolerance induction with factor IX products. Nephrotic syndrome has occurred following immune tolerance induction in patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reactions to therapy.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Factor IX levels (measure 15 minutes after infusion to verify calculated doses) (WFH [Srivastava] 2013), aPTT, BP, HR, signs of hypersensitivity reactions; screen for factor IX inhibitors if the patient experiences hypersensitivity reaction or when patient is to undergo surgery, if suboptimal response to treatment occurs, if patient is being intensively treated for &gt;5 days within 4 weeks of the last infusion, or at the following intervals (WFH [Srivastava] 2013):</p><p>Children: Screen for inhibitors every 5 exposure days until 20 exposure days, every 10 exposure days between 21 to 50 exposure days, and at a minimum of twice a year until 150 exposure days is reached.</p><p>Adults (with &gt;150 exposure days apart from a 6 to 12 monthly review): Screen for inhibitors when suboptimal response occurs.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Pregnant hemophilia B carriers may have an increased bleeding risk following abortion, invasive procedures, miscarriage, and delivery; close surveillance is recommended. Factor IX levels should be monitored at the first antenatal visit, once or twice during the third trimester, prior to surgical or invasive procedures, and at delivery. Although factor IX levels remain stable during pregnancy, factor IX replacement is recommended if concentrations are &lt;0.5 IU/mL and any of the following occur: need for invasive procedures (including delivery), spontaneous miscarriage, insertion and removal of epidural catheters, or active bleeding. Hemostatic factor IX concentrations should be maintained for at least 3 to 5 days following invasive procedures or postpartum. If replacement with a factor IX concentrate is indicated to increase factor IX during pregnancy, a recombinant product is preferred (NHF 2017; RCOG [Pavord 2017]; WFH [Srivastava 2013]).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat hemophilia.</p><p>• It is used to treat or prevent bleeding.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
