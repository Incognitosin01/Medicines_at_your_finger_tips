It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, or death.</p><p>Tetanus (lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to "locking" of the jaw so the victim cannot open the mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in about 1 out of 10 cases.</p><p>Diphtheria is spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through a cut or wound.</p><p>The  Decavac (also called Td) is used to help prevent these diseases in adults and children who are at least 7 years old.</p><p>This vaccine works by exposing you to a small dose of the bacteria or a protein from the bacteria, which causes the body to develop immunity to the disease. This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.</p><p>Like any vaccine, the Decavac may not provide protection from disease in every person.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing diphtheria or tetanus.</p><h2>Before taking this medicine</h2><p>You should not receive this vaccine if you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any vaccine containing diphtheria or tetanus.</p><p>You may not be able to receive this vaccine if you have ever received a similar vaccine that caused any of the following:</p><ul>

</li>
<li>

In the case of a more severe illness with a fever or any type of infection, wait until you get better before receiving this vaccine.</p><p>It is not known whether Td vaccine will harm an unborn baby. However, if you are at a high risk for infection with tetanus or diphtheria during pregnancy, your doctor should determine whether you need this vaccine.</p><p>It is not known whether this vaccine passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.</p><p>The adult version of this vaccine (Td) should not be given to anyone under the age of 7 years old. Another vaccine is available for use in younger children and infants.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">How is this vaccine given?</h2><p>This vaccine is given as an injection (shot) into a muscle. You will receive this injection in a doctor's office or clinic setting.</p><p>This vaccine is given in a series of 3 shots. The first shot is usually given to a person who is at least 7 years old. The booster shots are then given 4 to 8 weeks after the first shot, and 6 to 8 months after the second shot.</p><p>A booster shot is also recommended in children who are 11 or 12 years old, and again every 10 years throughout adulthood.</p><p>If it has been longer than 5 years since your last booster, you may need an emergency booster shot if you have been exposed to tetanus through a skin wound.</p><p>Your booster schedule may be different from these guidelines. Follow your doctor's instructions or the schedule recommended by your local health department.</p><p>Your doctor may recommend treating fever and pain with an aspirin free pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, and others) when the shot is given and for the next 24 hours. Follow the label directions or your doctor's instructions about how much of  Decavac to use.</p><p>It is especially important to prevent fever from occurring if you have a seizure disorder such as epilepsy.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Contact your doctor if you miss a booster dose or if you get behind schedule. The next dose should be given as soon as possible. There is no need to start over.</p><p>Be sure to receive all recommended doses of this vaccine. You may not be fully protected if you do not receive the full series.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>An overdose of this vaccine is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid before or after receiving this vaccine?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">This vaccine side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; dizziness, weakness; difficult breathing; fast heartbeats; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine. When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.</p><p>You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.</p><p>You may feel faint after receiving this vaccine. Some people have had seizure like reactions after receiving this vaccine. Your doctor may want you to remain under observation during the first 15 minutes after the injection.</p><p>Becoming infected with tetanus or diphtheria is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine.
