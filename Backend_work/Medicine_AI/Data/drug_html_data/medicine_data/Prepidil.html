A healthcare provider will insert  Prepidil at the correct time best prepare your cervix.</p><p>Dinoprostone is usually given while you are lying on your back. Your doctor may use a vaginal speculum to view your cervix. This will help your doctor determine how much of this medication to use.</p><p>You will need to remain lying down for 15 to 30 minutes, and possibly for up to 2 hours, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.</p><p>Your contractions and your baby's heartbeat will be constantly monitored after you are treated with dinoprostone. Your doctor will also check your cervix frequently to determine how much it has dilated.</p><p>Prepidil can cause contractions to occur more often and they may also last longer.</p><p>If your uterus responds to dinoprostone, you may begin having regular uterine contractions within a few hours. You may also be given other medications to help stimulate your uterine contractions and make them more regular.</p><p>If your uterus does not respond to dinoprostone within 6 hours, your doctor may apply a second dose.</p><p>A Prepidil suppository is usually removed once you begin labor, or 12 hours after the medicine was inserted.</p><h2>What happens if I miss a dose?</h2><p>Since dinoprostone is used when needed in a clinical setting, it does not have a daily dosing schedule.</p><h2>What happens if I overdose?</h2><p>Since  Prepidil is given by a healthcare professional in a medical setting, an overdose is unlikely to occur.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="what-to-avoid">What should I avoid after receiving  Prepidil?</h2><p>Follow your doctor's instructions about any restrictions on food, beverages, or activity.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Prepidil side effects</h2><p>Get emergency medical help if you have <b>signs of an allergic reaction:</b> hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.</p><p>Tell your caregivers at once if your contractions slow down or become uneven, or if you have:</p><ul>
