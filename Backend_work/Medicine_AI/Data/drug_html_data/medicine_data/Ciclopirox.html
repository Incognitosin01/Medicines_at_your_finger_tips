The biological half-life was 1.7 hours and excretion occurred via the kidney. Two days after application only 0.01% of the dose applied could be found in the urine. Fecal excretion was negligible.</p><p>Penetration studies in human cadaverous skin from the back, with Ciclopirox olamine cream with tagged Ciclopirox showed the presence of 0.8 to 1.6% of the dose in the stratum corneum 1.5 to 6 hours after application. The levels in the dermis were still 10 to 15 times above the minimum inhibitory concentrations.</p><p>Autoradiographic studies with human cadaverous skin showed that Ciclopirox penetrates into the hair and through the epidermis and hair follicles into the sebaceous glands and dermis, while a portion of the drug remains in the stratum corneum.</p><p>Draize Human Sensitization Assay, 21-Day Cumulative Irritancy study, Phototoxicity study, and Photo-Draize study conducted in a total of 142 healthy male subjects showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity, and no photo-contact sensitization due to Ciclopirox olamine cream.</p><h2>Indications and Usage for Ciclopirox</h2><p class="First">Ciclopirox Olamine Cream USP, 0.77% is indicated for the topical treatment of the following dermal infections: tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis due to <span class="Italics">Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum,</span> and <span class="Italics">Microsporum canis;</span> candidiasis (moniliasis) due to <span class="Italics">Candida albicans;</span> and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to <span class="Italics">Malassezia furfur.</span></p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">Ciclopirox Olamine Cream USP, 0.77% is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components.</p><h2>Warnings</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General</span> - Ciclopirox Olamine Cream USP, 0.77% is not for ophthalmic use.</p><p><span class="Bold">Keep out of reach of children.</span></p><h2>Precautions</h2><p class="First">If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur with the use of Ciclopirox Olamine Cream USP, 0.77%, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</p><h3>Information for Patients</h3><p class="First">The patient should be told to:</p><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility -</h3><p class="First">A carcinogenicity study in female mice dosed cutaneously twice per week for 50 weeks followed by a 6-month drug-free observation period prior to necropsy revealed no evidence of tumors at the application site.</p><p>The following <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> and <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> genotoxicity tests have been conducted with Ciclopirox olamine: studies to evaluate gene mutation in the Ames <span class="Italics">Salmonella/</span>Mammalian Microsome Assay (negative) and Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Assay (negative) and studies to evaluate chromosome aberrations <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> in the Mouse Dominant Lethal Assay and in the Mouse Micronucleus Assay at 500 mg/kg (negative).</p><p>The following battery of <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> genotoxicity tests were conducted with Ciclopirox: a chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese Hamster Cells, with and without metabolic activation (positive); a gene mutation assay in the HGPRT - test with V79 Chinese Hamster Cells (negative); and a primary DNA damage assay (i.e., unscheduled DNA Synthesis Assay in A549 Human Cells (negative)). An <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Cell Transformation Assay in BALB/C3T3 Cells was negative for cell transformation. In an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> Chinese Hamster Bone Marrow Cytogenetic Assay, Ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at 5,000 mg/kg.</p><h3>Pregnancy: Category B -</h3><p class="First">Reproduction studies have been performed in the mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey (via various routes of administration) at doses 10 times or more the topical human dose and have revealed no significant evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Ciclopirox. There are, however, no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</p><h3>Nursing Mothers -</h3><p class="First">It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Ciclopirox Olamine Cream USP, 0.77% is administered to a nursing woman.</p><h3>Pediatric Use -</h3><p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years have not been established.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">In all controlled clinical studies with 514 patients using Ciclopirox olamine cream and 296 patients using the vehicle cream, the incidence of adverse reactions was low.
