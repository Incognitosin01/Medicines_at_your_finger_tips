In your body, iron becomes a part of your hemoglobin (HEEM o glo bin) and myoglobin (MY o glo bin). Hemoglobin carries oxygen through your blood to tissues and organs. Myoglobin helps your muscle cells store oxygen.</p><p>Ferrlecit is used to treat iron deficiency anemia (a lack of red blood cells caused by having too little iron in the body) in adults and children at least 6 years old.
