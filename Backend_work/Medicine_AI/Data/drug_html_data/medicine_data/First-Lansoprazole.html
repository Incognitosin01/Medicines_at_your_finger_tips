It is used to treat duodenal and gastric ulcers, gastric ulcers caused by NSAID use, erosive esophagitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition wherein the acid in the stomach washes back up into the esophagus. Sometimes lansoprazole is used in combination with antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) to treat ulcers associated with an infection caused by H. pylori bacteria.</p><p>Lansoprazole is also used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), which is a condition where the stomach produces too much acid.</p><p>Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach.</p><p>This medicine is available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using First - Lansoprazole</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 1 year of age.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of lansoprazole in the elderly.
