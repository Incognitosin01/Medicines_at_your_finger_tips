Clinically, phenylephrine shrinks swollen mucous membranes, reduces tissue hyperemia, edema, and nasal congestion, and increases nasal airway patency.</p><p>Chlorpheniramine maleate is an alkylamine-type antihistamine. This group of antihistamines is among the most active histamine antagonists and is generally effective in relatively low doses.</p><p>Methscopolamine nitrate is a quaternary ammonium derivative of the anticholinergic scopolamine which possesses the peripheral actions of the belladonna alkaloids, but does not exhibit the central actions because of its lack of ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Its antimuscarinic effect causes inhibition of salivary secretions, reduction in volume and total acid content of gastric secretion, and inhibition of gastrointestinal motility. It is poorly and unreliably absorbed. Drug effects appear in about one hour and persist for about 4 to 6 hours. It is excreted primarily in the urine and bile, or as unabsorbed drug in feces.</p><h2>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h2><p class="First">For the temporary relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis.</p><h2>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h2><p class="First">This product is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to phenylephrine HCl, methscopolamine nitrate, and chlorpheniramine maleate. AlleRx® PE is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, patients on monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy or within 14 days of stopping monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy, and in nursing mothers. AlleRx PE is also contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, peptic ulcer, and during an asthmatic attack.</p><h2>WARNINGS</h2><p class="First">Sympathomimetic amines should be used cautiously in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure, and prostatic hypertrophy. Sympathomimetics may produce central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension. The elderly (60 years or older) are more likely to exhibit adverse reactions. Antihistamines may cause excitability, especially in children. At dosages higher than the recommended dose, nervousness, dizziness, or sleeplessness may occur. Do not exceed recommended dosage.</p><p>Methscopolamine nitrate may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be cautioned regarding activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or performing hazardous work while taking AlleRx PE.</p><p>Co-administration of sildenafil citrate and other organic nitrates has been shown to potentiate the hypotension effects of nitrates. Co-administration of AlleRx PE and sildenafil citrate has not been studied. Therefore, the use of sildenafil citrate and AlleRx PE together is not recommended.</p><h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">General:</span> AlleRx PE should be used with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and hyperactivity to sympathomimetic amines. Hypertensive patients should only use with medical advice, as they may experience a change in blood pressure due to added vasoconstriction. Antihistamines may cause drowsiness, and ambulatory patients who operate machinery or motor vehicles should be cautioned accordingly. Methscopolamine nitrate should be used with caution in the elderly and all patients with autonomic neuropathy, hepatic or renal disease, or ulcerative colitis.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Drug Interactions:</span> Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers increase the effects of sympathomimetic amines. Sympathomimetic amines may reduce the antihypertensive effects of methyldopa, guanethidine, mecamylamine, reserpine and veratrum alkaloids. Additive anticholinergic effects may result from concomitant use with antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs with anticholinergic effects. Concomitant administration with antacids may interfere with the absorption of methscopolamine nitrate.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:</span> Animal studies to assess the long-term carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility in animals or humans have not been performed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pregnancy Category C:</span> It is not known whether AlleRx can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. AlleRx should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Nursing Mothers:</span> It is not known whether this combination drug is excreted in human milk. However, phenylephrine HCl administered alone distributes into the breast milk of lactating human females; therefore, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Pediatric Use:</span> The safety and effectiveness in children under 12 years of age have not been established.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use:</span> The elderly (60 years and older) are more likely to experience adverse reactions to sympathomimetics. Overdosage of sympathomimetics in this age group may cause hallucinations, convulsions, CNS depression, and/or death. Demonstrate safe use of a short-acting sympathomimetic amine before use of an extended-action formulation.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">Adverse reactions include drowsiness, lassitude, nausea, giddiness, dryness of mouth, blurred vision, cardiac palpitations, flushing, and increased irritability or excitement (especially in children). Some individuals may display sympathomimetic amine effects such as tachycardia, palpitations, headache, dizziness, or nausea. Sympathomimetics have been associated with certain untoward reactions including fear, anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, pallor, respiratory difficulty, dysuria, insomnia, hallucinations, convulsions, CNS depression, arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse with hypotension. Urinary retention may occur in patients with prostatic hypertrophy. Antihistamines and anticholinergics may cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and excessive dryness of the nose, throat, and mouth.</p><h2>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE:</h2><p class="First">Central nervous system stimulants such as phenylephrine have been abused. At high doses, subjects commonly experience an elevation of mood, sense of increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. With continued use, tolerance develops, the user increases the dose, and toxic signs and symptoms appear. Depression may follow rapid withdraw.</p><h2>OVERDOSAGE AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE</h2><p class="First">The treatment of overdosage should provide symptomatic and supportive care. Induction of emesis and gastric lavage may be performed if the patient is alert and seen within early hours after ingestion. Drug remaining in the stomach may be absorbed by the administration of activated charcoal. Stimulants should not be used because they may precipitate convulsions. If convulsions or marked CNS excitement occurs, treatment with appropriate measures is indicated. Since the effects of AlleRx last up to 12 hours, the patient should be monitored for at least that length of time and treated as necessary.</p><h2>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and over:</span> One orange AM tablet in the morning and one blue PM tablet in the evening. AlleRx is not recommended for children under 12 years of age.</p><h2>HOW SUPPLIED</h2><p class="First">(NDC 10122-705-20) AlleRx PE Tablets 10 Day Treatment Regimen, containing 20 tablets as follows:<br/>
