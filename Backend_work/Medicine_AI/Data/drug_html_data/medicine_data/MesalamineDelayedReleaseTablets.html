Evaluate the risks and benefits of using mesalamine in patients with known renal impairment, history of renal disease, or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]</span>.</p><h3>Mesalamine-Induced Acute Intolerance Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis. Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine. Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash. Monitor patients closely for worsening of these symptoms while on treatment. If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with mesalamine delayed-release tablets.</p><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking sulfasalazine. Some of these patients may have a similar reaction to mesalamine delayed-release tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine.</p><p>As with sulfasalazine, mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions may present as internal organ involvement, including myocarditis, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and hematologic abnormalities. Evaluate patients immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction are present. Discontinue mesalamine delayed-release tablets if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine. Evaluate the risk and benefit of using mesalamine in patients with known liver impairment.</p><h3>Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Obstruction</h3><p class="First">Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of mesalamine delayed-release tablets, which would delay mesalamine release in the colon. Avoid mesalamine in patients at risk of upper gastrointestinal tract obstruction.</p><h3>Photosensitivity</h3><p class="First">Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen when outdoors.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and the main metabolite of mesalamine, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA). Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The most serious adverse reactions seen in mesalamine delayed-release tablets clinical trials or with other products that contain or are metabolized to mesalamine are:</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Adults</span></span></p><p> <span class="Italics">Induction</span></p><p>The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of mesalamine -or placebo-treated adult patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in two eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 1 and Study 2) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</span> are listed in Table 2.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Adverse Reaction</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mesalamine</span><br/>

Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Azathioprine and 6-Mercaptopurine</h3><p class="First">The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of mesalamine and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.</p><h3>Interference with Laboratory Tests</h3><p class="First">Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>. Consider an alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations).</p><p>In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the</p><p>U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Data</span></span></p><p><span class="Italics">Human Data</span></p><p>Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association of mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There is no clear evidence that mesalamine exposure in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including cardiac malformations. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of the data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, maternal use of concomitant medications, and missing information on the dose and duration of use for mesalamine products.</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies with mesalamine during organogenesis have been performed in rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg/kg/day (2.9 times the maximum recommended human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesalamine.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Risk Summary</span></span></p><p>Data from published literature report the presence of mesalamine and its metabolite, N-acetyl- 5-aminosalicylic acid in human milk in small amounts with relative infant doses (RID) of 0.1% or less for mesalamine (see Data). There are case reports of diarrhea in breastfed infants exposed to mesalamine (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information on the effects of the drug on milk production. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes a clear determination of the risk of mesalamine to an infant during lactation; therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mesalamine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mesalamine or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Clinical Considerations</span></span></p><p>Advise the caregiver to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea.</p><p><span class="Italics">Data</span></p><p>In published lactation studies, maternal mesalamine doses from various oral and rectal formulations and products ranged from 500 mg to 4.8 g daily. The average concentration of mesalamine in milk ranged from non-detectable to 0.5 mg/L. The average concentration of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid in milk ranged from 0.2 to 9.3 mg/L. Based on these concentrations, estimated infant daily dosages for an exclusively breastfed infant are 0 to 0.075 mg/kg/day (RID 0% to 0.1%) of mesalamine and 0.03 to 1.4 mg/kg/day of N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have been established for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients weighing at least 24 kg. Use of mesalamine in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials in adults, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 105 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age, and additional pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety profile in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)]</span>.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine have not been established in patients weighing less than 24 kg.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of mesalamine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Reports from uncontrolled clinical studies and postmarketing reporting systems suggested a higher incidence of blood dyscrasias (i.e., agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and pancytopenia) in patients who were 65 years or older who were taking mesalamine-containing products such as mesalamine compared to younger patients. Monitor complete blood cell counts and platelet counts in elderly patients during treatment with mesalamine.</p><p>Systemic exposures are increased in elderly subjects <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</p><p>In general, consider the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients when prescribing mesalamine. Consider starting at the low end of the dosing range for induction in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</span>.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Mesalamine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Evaluate renal function in all patients prior to initiation and periodically while on mesalamine tablets therapy. Monitor patients with known renal impairment or history of renal disease or taking nephrotoxic drugs for decreased renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions. <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1), Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</span>.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate, and symptoms of salicylate toxicity may include tinnitus, vertigo, headache, confusion, drowsiness, sweating, seizures, hyperventilation, dyspnea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe intoxication may lead to disruption of electrolyte balance and blood pH, hyperthermia, dehydration, and end organ damage.</p><p>There is no specific known antidote for mesalamine overdose; however, conventional therapy for salicylate toxicity may be beneficial in the event of acute overdosage. Correct fluid and electrolyte imbalance and maintain adequate renal function.</p><h2>Mesalamine Delayed Release Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Each mesalamine delayed-release tablet for oral administration contains 1.2 g</p><p>5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; mesalamine), an anti-inflammatory agent. Mesalamine also has the chemical name 5-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and its structural formula is:</p><p>Molecular formula: C<span class="Sub">7</span>H<span class="Sub">7</span>NO<span class="Sub">3</span></p><p>Molecular weight: 153.14</p><p>Mesalamine, USP is a light tan to pink colored, needle-shaped crystals. Color may darken on exposure to air. It is odorless or may have a slight characteristic odor.</p><p>The tablet is coated with a pH-dependent polymer film, which breaks down at or above pH 6.8, normally in the terminal ileum where mesalamine then begins to be released from the tablet core<span class="Italics">.</span> The tablet core contains mesalamine with hydrophilic excipients and provides for extended release of mesalamine.</p><p>Each mesalamine delayed-release tablet intended for oral administration contains 1.2 g of mesalamine. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: carboxymethylcellulose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, hypromellose, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid copolymer, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium starch glycolate, triethyl citrate, talc and titanium dioxide.</p><p>USP Drug Release Test pending.</p><h2>Mesalamine Delayed Release Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but it appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold"><span class="Italics">Absorption</span></span></p><p>The total absorption of mesalamine from mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy subjects was found to be approximately 21% to 22 % of the administered dose.</p><p>Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy subjects. Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>In a single-dose study, mesalamine delayed-release tablets 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9 to 12 hours on average for the doses studied. The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 4). Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Maximum plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g mesalamine delayed-release tablets, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74 % of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Parameter<span class="Sup">*</span> of Mesalamine</span><br/></p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mesalamine</span><br/>

The study population was primarily Caucasian (80%), had a mean age of 42 years (6% age 65 years or older), and was approximately 50% male. Both studies used mesalamine delayed-release tablets doses of 2.4 g and 4.8 g administered once daily for 8 weeks, except in Study 1 the 2.4 g dosage was administered as two divided doses (i.e., 1.2 g twice daily). The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was to compare the percentage of patients in remission after 8 weeks of treatment for the mesalamine delayed-release tablets treatment groups versus placebo. Remission was defined as an Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UC-DAI) of ≤ 1, with scores of zero for rectal bleeding and for stool frequency, and a sigmoidoscopy score reduction of 1 point or more from baseline.</p><p>In both studies, the mesalamine delayed-release tablets dosages of 2.4 g and 4.8 g once daily demonstrated superiority over placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (Table 6).

The primary endpoint was defined by the partial UC-DAI less than or equal to 1 (with rectal bleeding equal to 0, stool frequency less than or equal to 1, and Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] equal to 0). Of the 26 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 65% achieved the primary endpoint after 8 weeks of treatment. During the initial 8 week phase, fewer patients who received the recommended mesalamine dosage were discontinued from the study due to ulcerative colitis (0/26, 0%) compared to patients who received a lower than recommended mesalamine dosage (8/27, 30%).</p><p>Patients who met the primary endpoint at 8 weeks were eligible to continue treatment in the 26 week phase. Patients were also eligible to enter the 26 week phase without having participated in the 8 week phase if they had a UC-DAI score of less than or equal to 2 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1 (modified to exclude friability).</p><p>There were 87 patients enrolled in the 26 week phase. The mean age and weight of patients were 14 years and 54 kg; 97% were white and 55% were female. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 55% achieved the primary endpoint, which was defined the same as in the 8 week phase.

Patients without endoscopic data at week 26 were assumed not to have achieved clinical remission. Of the 42 patients in the recommended mesalamine dosage arm, 36% achieved clinical remission.
