</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for fospropofol</h2><p>Fospropofol is used to make a person relax or sleep (be unconscious) before and during surgery or procedures. Fospropofol is a strong sedative.</p><p>Fospropofol is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using fospropofol</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For fospropofol, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to fospropofol or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of fospropofol in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fospropofol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related heart disease, which may require an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving fospropofol.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are receiving fospropofol, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using fospropofol with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases.
