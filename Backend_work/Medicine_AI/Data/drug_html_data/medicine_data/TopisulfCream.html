First, cleanse your skin thoroughly before application. Second, apply a thin layer of <span class="Bold">Topisulf Emollient Cream</span> to the affected areas as directed by your doctor. Finally, start using <span class="Bold">Topisulf Emollient Cream</span> once daily to minimize dryness, then increase application frequency to 2-3 times daily or as directed by your doctor.<br/></p><h2>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:</h2><p class="First">Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraided skin are involved. Sulfonamides are known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome in hypersensitive individuals. Stevens-Johnson syndrome also has been reported following the use of sodium sulfacetamide topically. Cases of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus from topical sulfacetamide also have been reported. In one of these cases, there was a fatal outcome. In addition, patients with kidney disease should not use <span class="Bold">Topisulf Emollient Cream</span>.<br/>
<span class="Bold"><br/>
Topisulf Emollient Cream</span> is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes, eyelids, lips, other mucous membranes and any damaged areas of the skin, such as wounds or open sores. If accidental contact with one of these areas occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.<br/>
