Systemic absorption may occur from a denuded bladder.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Use: Labeled Indications</h2><p><b>Urinary bladder irrigant: </b>Continuous irrigant or rinse for short-term use (up to 10 days) in the urinary bladder of abacteriuric patients to help prevent bacteriuria and gram-negative rod septicemia associated with the use of indwelling catheters.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>Hypersensitivity to neomycin, polymyxin B, or any component of the formulation; history of a serious toxic reaction to an aminoglycoside</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Urinary bladder irrigant:</b> Intravesical: Add 1 mL irrigant to 1,000 mL isotonic saline solution per day as a continuous irrigation for up to 10 days.</p><p><b>Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: </b>Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Consult drug interactions database for more information.</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Concentrated irrigant solution must be diluted prior to administration; add 1 mL of irrigant to 1,000 mL of isotonic saline solution.</p><h2>Administration</h2><p>For bladder irrigation only; not for injection. Connect irrigation container to the inflow lumen of a 3-way catheter to permit continuous irrigation of the urinary bladder. Rinsing of the bladder should be <b>continuous</b>; the inflow or rinse solution should not be interrupted for more than a few minutes. Adjust flow rate to 1,000 mL/24 hours; if patient’s urine output exceeds 2,000 mL/day, increase flow rate to 2,000 mL/24 hours.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).
