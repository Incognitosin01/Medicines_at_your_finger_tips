<li>Zeposia is a prescription medicine used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.</li>
<li>It is not known if this medicine is safe and effective in children.</li>
</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Zeposia may cause serious side effects, including:</p><p><strong>1. Infections.</strong> Zeposia can increase your risk of serious infections that can be life-threatening and cause death. Zeposia lowers the number of white blood cells (lymphocytes) in your blood. This will usually go back to normal within 3 months of stopping treatment. Your healthcare provider may do a blood test of your white blood cells before you start treatment.<br/>
<br/>

<li>fever</li>

<li>flu-like symptoms</li>
<li>cough</li>
<li>painful and frequent urination (signs of a urinary tract infection)</li>
<li>rash</li>
<li>headache with fever, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, nausea or confusion (these may be symptoms of meningitis, an infection of the lining around your brain and spine)</li>
</ul><p>Your healthcare provider may delay starting or may stop your Zeposia treatment if you have an infection.</p><p><strong>2. Slow heart rate (also known as bradyarrhythmia) when you start taking Zeposia.</strong> Zeposia may cause your heart rate to temporarily slow down, especially during the first 8 days that you take Zeposia. You will have a test to check the electrical activity of your heart called an electrocardiogram (ECG) before you take your first dose of Zeposia. Call your healthcare provider if you experience the following symptoms of slow heart rate:</p><ul>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>lightheadedness</li>
<li>feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats</li>

The capsule shell contains: black iron oxide, gelatin, red iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and yellow iron oxide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="faq">Popular FAQ</h2><p>Ozanimod is a not a biologic it is a small-molecule S1P receptor modulator that binds specifically to two S1P receptors and is thought to block the ability of lymphocytes to escape out of the lymph nodes reducing their numbers in the blood, CNS, and inflamed tissue. Continue reading</p><p>The reason ozanimod may slow down your heart rate temporarily when you first start taking it is thought to be due to the action of ozanimod binding to one of the S1P receptors' subunits, S1P1R, which also has an effect of potassium channels in cardiac muscle cells. This reduces how responsive the cardiac cells are and reduces their firing rate, which slows down the heart.
