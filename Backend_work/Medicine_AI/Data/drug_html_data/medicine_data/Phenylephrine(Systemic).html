This is advantageous in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypotension since increases in both heart rate and contractility may cause the obstruction to worsen, leading to a decrease in cardiac output. Other vasopressors like dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine may increase contractility and/or heart rate <sup>[Hensley 2015]</sup>, <sup>[Nishimura 2004]</sup>.</p><p>Based on the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, the use of phenylephrine is recommended for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who develop acute hypotension unresponsive to fluid administration.</p><h3>Priapism (ischemic)</h3><p>Data from an open-label nonrandomized study supports the use of phenylephrine in the treatment of ischemic priapism <sup>[Dittrich 1991]</sup>. Higher doses have been employed with continuous cardiovascular monitoring for patients who have not responded to usual dosing; however, this dosing cannot be recommended as routine <sup>[Munarriz 2006]</sup>. Additional trials may be necessary to further define the role of phenylephrine in this condition.</p><p>Based on the American Urological Association guidelines for the management of priapism, due to the low risk of cardiovascular side effects intracavernous injection of phenylephrine is recommended for ischemic priapism that persists following aspiration/irrigation.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2><p>There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>OTC labeling (Oral): When used for self-medication: Use with or within 14 days of monoamine oxidase inhibitor therapy</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Dosing: Adult</h2><p><b>Hypotension/shock:</b> <b>Note:</b> The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) does <b>not</b> recommend phenylephrine for septic shock <i>except</i> in the following circumstances: When norepinephrine (preferred first-line agent) is associated with serious arrhythmias, when cardiac output is known to be high and blood pressure persistently low, or when the combination of inotrope/vasopressor and low-dose vasopressin failed to achieve target mean arterial pressure and phenylephrine is used as salvage therapy (Rhodes 2017).

May also precipitate angina in patients with severe coronary artery disease and increase pulmonary arterial pressure. Use with caution in patients with preexisting bradycardia, partial heart block, myocardial disease, or severe coronary artery disease. Avoid or use with extreme caution in patients with heart failure or cardiogenic shock; increased systemic vascular resistance may significantly reduce cardiac output. Avoid use in patients with hypertension (contraindicated in severe hypertension); monitor blood pressure closely and adjust infusion rate. May also cause excessive peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction and ischemia to vital organs, particularly in patients with extensive peripheral vascular disease.</p><p>• Extravasation: IV administration: Vesicant; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation.</p><p><b><i>Disease-related concerns:</i></b></p><p>• Acidosis: Acidosis may reduce the efficacy of phenylephrine; correct acidosis prior to or during use of phenylephrine.</p><p>• Autonomic dysfunction: Patients with autonomic dysfunction (eg, spinal cord injury) may exhibit an exaggerated increase in blood pressure response to phenylephrine.</p><p><b><i>Concurrent drug therapy issues:</i></b></p><p>• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors: Use with extreme caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors; hypertension may result from concurrent use.</p><p><b><i>Dosage form specific issues:</i></b></p><p>• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP ["Inactive" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.</p><p>• Oral: When used for self-medication (OTC), use with caution in patients with asthma, bowel obstruction/narrowing, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, increased intraocular pressure, prostatic hyperplasia, or in the elderly. Notify health care provider if symptoms do not improve within 7 days or are accompanied by fever. Discontinue and contact health care provider if nervousness, dizziness, or sleeplessness occur.</p><p>• Sulfites: Some products contain sulfites which may cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.</p><p><b><i>Other warnings/precautions:</i></b></p><p>• Appropriate use: When used intravenously in patients who are hypotensive, assure adequate circulatory volume to minimize need for vasoconstrictors.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Blood pressure (or mean arterial pressure), heart rate; cardiac output (as appropriate), intravascular volume status, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (as appropriate); monitor infusion site closely</p><p>Consult individual institutional policies and procedures.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Phenylephrine crosses the placenta at term.</p><p>Maternal use of phenylephrine during the first trimester of pregnancy is not strongly associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations; maternal dose and duration of therapy were not reported in available publications. Phenylephrine is available over-the-counter for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. Decongestants are not the preferred agents for the treatment of rhinitis during pregnancy. Oral phenylephrine should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy; short-term use (&lt;3 days) of intranasal phenylephrine may be beneficial to some patients although its safety during pregnancy has not been studied. Phenylephrine injection is used at delivery for the prevention and/or treatment of maternal hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia in women undergoing cesarean section. Phenylephrine may be associated with a more favorable fetal acid base status than ephedrine; however, overall fetal outcomes appear to be similar. Nausea or vomiting may be less with phenylephrine than ephedrine but is also dependent upon blood pressure control. Phenylephrine may be preferred in the absence of maternal bradycardia.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p><b>All oral products:</b></p><p>• It is used to treat nose stuffiness.</p><p><b>Injection:</b></p><p>• It is used to treat low blood pressure.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
