The species derive their common names from the shape of the aromatic leaf.Gentry 1961 The buchus grow up to 6 feet tall as low, bushy, drought-resistant shrubs with colorful blossoms. The leaves are described as yellowish green to brown, glossy and leathery, revealing oil-glandular dots on the underside. The three species produce oval, serrated leaves with the leaf of B. serratifolia being the longest and most slender. Harvesting of the leaves occurs in summer. Most commonly, B. betulina is used in commerce. Native to South Africa, buchu undergoes hillside cultivation. Odor and taste of the plants is described as spicy, resembling black currant but also reminiscent of a mixture between rosemary and peppermint.Bisset 1994, Chevallier 1996 Buchu oil is sometimes added as a component of black currant flavorings. Synonyms include Barosma betulina [Berg.] Bartl. &amp; Wendl. (short buchu); Barosma serratifolia (Curt.) Willd. (long buchu); and Barosma crenulata (L.) Hook. (ovate buchu). These plants should not be confused with "Indian buchu" (Myrtus communis L.), which is native to the Mediterranean regions.</p><h2>History</h2><p>The Hottentots employed the leaves for the treatment of a great number of ailments. Early patent medicines sold in the United States hailed the virtues of the plant and its volatile oil for the management of diseases ranging from diabetes to nervousness. The drug had been included in the US National Formulary and was described as a diuretic and antiseptic. Its use has since been abandoned in favor of more effective diuretics and antibacterials. Buchu remains a popular ingredient in over-the-counter herbal diuretic preparations.Osol 1960</p><p>Buchu was first exported to Britain in 1790. In 1821, it was listed in the <i>British Pharmacopoeia</i> as a medicine for "cystitis, urethritis, nephritis and catarrh of the bladder."Chevallier 1996</p><h2>Chemistry</h2><p>Buchu leaves contain from 1.5% to 3.5% volatile oil. Over 100 components exist in the oilLeung 1980, Osol 1960 including diosphenol (the main component in distilled oil, also called buchu camphor, barosma camphor or 1-pulegone), limonene, methone, pulegone, terpinen-4-ol and p-menthan-3-on-8-thiol (responsible for the aroma of the plant).Bisset 1994, Gentry 1961, Newall 1996</p><p>Flavonoids include diosmetin, quercetin, diosmin, quercetin-3,7-diglucoside and rutin. Other constituents include mucilage, resin, thiamine and sulfur compounds. Coumarins have been reported from other agathosma species.Chevallier 1996, Newall 1996</p><h2>Uses and Pharmacology</h2><p>No scientific evidence is available to justify buchu's herbal uses, but its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects may be attributed to the volatile oil and flavonoid's irritant nature.Newall 1996 Diosphenol, the flavonoids and terpinen-4-ol may contribute to the plant's diuretic activity, but this action of buchu teas is probably no greater than that of the xanthine alkaloids in coffee or tea.Medical Letter 1979 Buchu is listed in the German Commission E Monographs to treat inflammation, kidney and urinary tract infections and is also used as a diuretic, but the monograph explains that the plant's activity in these claimed uses has not been substantiated.Bisset 1994</p><p>Other reported uses of buchu include carminative action, treatment for cystitis, urethritis, prostatitis, gout and as a stomach tonic.Duke 1989</p><p>An infusion of the leaves has been used gynecologically as a douche for leukorrhea and for yeast infections.Chevallier 1996 Diosphenol may be responsible for buchu's antibacterial effects.Bisset 1994</p><p>Despite the lack of evidence, buchu is still used today in western herbal medicine for urinary tract ailments, cystitis or urethritis prophylaxis and prostatitis. It is also used in combination with other herbs such as cornsilk, juniper and uva-ursi.Chevallier 1996</p><h2>Dosing</h2><p>There is no recent clinical evidence to guide dosage of buchu. Classical doses were from 1 to 2 g of the leaves daily.</p><h2>Pregnancy / Lactation</h2><p>Documented adverse effects, including uterine stimulant effects.Brinker 1998 Avoid use.</p><h2>Interactions</h2><p>None well documented.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>Essential oil components diosmin and pulegone can cause GI and renal irritation.Bisset 1994, Newall 1996 Pulegone is known to be hepatotoxic (depletes glutathione and leads to haptocellular necrosis),Vamenta-Morris 2014 an abortifacient, and to increase menstrual flow; therefore, use is not recommended during pregnancy.</p><h2>Toxicology</h2><p>Poisoning has not been reported.Bisset 1994, Newall 1996 Pulegone is also a hepatotoxin, present in the plant "pennyroyal," in larger quantities.Chevallier 1996, Newall 1996</p><h2>Index Terms</h2><ul><li><i>Barosma betulina</i> [Berg.] Bartl. &amp; Wendl.</li><li><i>Barosma crenulata</i> (L.)
