High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled .</p><p>Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker. It works by affecting the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, nicardipine relaxes blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload .</p><p>This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using Cardene IV</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
