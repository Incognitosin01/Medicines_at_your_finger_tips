HT-1 is a metabolic disorder that occurs when the body does not produce enough of an enzyme that breaks down proteins from certain foods. This condition occurs most often in young babies.</p><p>Orfadin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings</h2><p>Call your doctor at once if you have vision problems, eye pain, eye redness or burning, easy bruising, unusual bleeding, itching, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).
