Follow these guidelines for 12 hours after receiving samarium Sm 153 lexidronam injection, to help reduce the chance of contaminating other persons or the environment with radiation:</p><ul>
<li>Use a normal toilet, if available, instead of a urinal.</li>

</ul><p>Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection.

<li>If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.</li>

<li>Do not touch your eyes or the inside of your nose unless you have just washed your hands and have not touched anything else in the meantime.</li>
<li>Be careful not to cut yourself when you are using sharp objects such as a safety razor or fingernail or toenail cutters.</li>
<li>Avoid contact sports or other situations where bruising or injury could occur.</li>
