</ul><p>Pharmacologic Class: Adalimumab</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="uses">Uses for adalimumab-adaz</h2><p>Adalimumab-adaz injection is used to treat the symptoms and prevent the progression of moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis. It is used in children 4 years of age and older for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Adalimumab-adaz is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that causes pain and swelling in the joints along with patches of scaly skin on some areas of the body. Psoriatic arthritis usually occurs with a skin condition called psoriasis. Adalimumab-adaz may be used alone or in combination with other medicines (eg, methotrexate).</p><p>Adalimumab-adaz injection is also used to treat the symptoms of active Crohn's disease in adult patients who have not been helped by other medicines, including infliximab. It is also used to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in patients who have been treated with other medicines (eg, azathioprine, corticosteroids, or 6-mercaptopurine) that did not work well.</p><p>Adalimumab-adaz injection is also used to treat moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, which is a skin disease with red patches and white scales that do not go away.</p><p>Adalimumab-adaz is available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using adalimumab-adaz</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For adalimumab-adaz, the following should be considered:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to adalimumab-adaz or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.</p><h3>Pediatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab-adaz injection for the <i>treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis</i> in children 4 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age or weighing less than 10 kilograms (kg) for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Safety and efficacy have not been established for other uses in children.</p><h3>Geriatric</h3><p>Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of adalimumab-adaz injection in the elderly. However, adalimumab-adaz may cause serious infections and cancer more often in the elderly, which may require caution in patients receiving adalimumab-adaz.</p><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><p>There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.</p><h3>Interactions with medicines</h3><p>Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking adalimumab-adaz, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.</p><p>Using adalimumab-adaz with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.</p><ul>

Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.</p><h3>Other medical problems</h3><p>The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of adalimumab-adaz.

</ul><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="dosage">Proper use of adalimumab-adaz</h2><p>Adalimumab-adaz is given as a shot under your skin in the upper thighs or stomach. It may sometimes be given at home to patients who do not need to be in the hospital or clinic. If you are using adalimumab-adaz at home, your doctor or nurse will teach you how to prepare and inject the medicine. Be sure that you understand how to use adalimumab-adaz.</p><p>Adalimumab-adaz comes with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.</p><p>If you use adalimumab-adaz at home, you will be shown the body areas where this shot can be given. Use a different body area each time you give yourself or your child a shot. Keep track of where you give each shot to make sure you rotate body areas. This will help prevent skin problems. Do not inject into skin areas that are red, bruised, tender, hard, or scaly, or areas with scars or stretch marks.</p><p>Allow 15 to 30 minutes for the medicine to warm up to room temperature. Do not remove the needle cover while allowing the medicine to reach to room temperature. Remove it before use.</p><p>Check the liquid in the syringe. It should be clear and colorless to slightly yellow. Do not use the syringe if it is cloudy, discolored, or has particles in it.</p><p>If you are using the <i>Sensoready® pen</i>, you will hear 2 loud clicks. The first click will tell you that the injection has started and the second click will tell you when it is almost finished. Keep the pen injected until you see a green indicator.</p><h3>Dosing</h3><p>The dose of adalimumab-adaz will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of adalimumab-adaz. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.</p><p>The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.</p><ul>

Keep this container away from children and pets.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Precautions while using adalimumab-adaz</h2><p><i>It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits</i> to make sure adalimumab-adaz is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.</p><p>You or your child will need to have a skin test for tuberculosis before you start using adalimumab-adaz. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your home has ever had a positive reaction to a tuberculosis skin test.</p><p>Adalimumab-adaz injection will lower the number of some types of blood cells in your body. Because of this, you may bleed or get infections more easily. To help with these problems, avoid being near people who are sick or have infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from rough sports or other situations where you could be bruised, cut, or injured. Brush and floss your teeth gently. Be careful when using sharp objects, including razors and fingernail clippers.</p><p>Adalimumab-adaz may cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after adalimumab-adaz is used. A small number of people (including children and teenagers) who have used this type of medicine have developed certain types of cancer (eg, leukemia). Some patients also developed a rare type of cancer called lymphoma. Talk with your doctor if you or your child have unusual bleeding, bruising, or weakness, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarms, or groin, or unexplained weight loss. Also, check with your doctor right away if your skin has red, scaly patches, or raised bumps that are filled with pus.</p><p>Adalimumab-adaz injection may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using adalimumab-adaz.</p><p>The <i>gray needle cap of the prefilled syringe</i> and the <i>gray needle cover within the needle cap of the Sensoready® pen</i> contains natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Tell your doctor if you have a latex allergy before receiving adalimumab-adaz.</p><p>Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms: swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs, or sudden weight gain. These may be signs of a heart condition called congestive heart failure (CHF).</p><p>Some people who have used adalimumab-adaz developed lupus-like symptoms during treatment and got better after the medicine was stopped. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child start having chest pains, joint pain, or a rash on your cheeks or arms that is sensitive to the sun.</p><p>Do not have any live vaccines (immunizations) while you or your child are being treated with adalimumab-adaz. Your child's vaccines need to be current before he or she begins using adalimumab-adaz. Be sure to ask your child's doctor if you have any questions about this.</p><p>Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="side-effects">Adalimumab-adaz side effects</h2><p>Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects.
