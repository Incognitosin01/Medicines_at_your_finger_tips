Movements may be choreoathetotic in appearance. The risk of developing TD and the likelihood that TD will become irreversible increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dosage. Additionally, the risk of developing TD is increased among the elderly, especially elderly women <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</span>, and in patients with diabetes mellitus. Due to the risk of developing TD, avoid treatment with Reglan for longer than 12 weeks and reduce the dosage in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].</span></p><p>Discontinue Reglan immediately in patients who develop signs and symptoms of TD. There is no known effective treatment for established cases of TD, although in some patients TD may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to months after Reglan is withdrawn.</p><p>Reglan itself may suppress, or partially suppress, the signs of TD, thereby masking the underlying disease process. The effect of this symptomatic suppression upon the long-term course of TD is unknown. Reglan is contraindicated in patients with a history of TD <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)].</span> Avoid Reglan in patients receiving other drugs that are likely to cause TD (e.g., antipsychotics).</p><h3>Other Extrapyramidal Symptoms</h3><p class="First">In addition to TD, metoclopramide may cause other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), parkinsonian symptoms, and motor restlessness. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur and to discontinue Reglan.</p><h3>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</h3><p class="First">Metoclopramide may cause a potentially fatal symptom complex called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS has been reported in association with metoclopramide overdosage and concomitant treatment with another drug associated with NMS. Avoid Reglan in patients receiving other drugs associated with NMS, including typical and atypical antipsychotics.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and manifestations of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac arrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Patients with such symptoms should be evaluated immediately.</p><p>In the diagnostic evaluation, consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever, serotonin syndrome, and primary central nervous system pathology.</p><p>Management of NMS includes:</p><h3>Depression</h3><p class="First">Depression has occurred in metoclopramide-treated patients with and without a history of depression. Symptoms have included suicidal ideation and suicide. Avoid Reglan use in patients with a history of depression.</p><h3>Hypertension</h3><p class="First">Metoclopramide may elevate blood pressure. In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, avoid use in patients with hypertension or in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</span>.</p><p>There are also clinical reports of hypertensive crises in patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma. Reglan is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas <span class="Italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</span>. Discontinue Reglan in any patient with a rapid rise in blood pressure.</p><h3>Fluid Retention</h3><p class="First">Because Reglan produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, patients with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. Discontinue Reglan if any of these adverse reactions occur.</p><h3>Hyperprolactinemia</h3><p class="First">As with other dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor antagonists, metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels.</p><p>Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating drugs, including metoclopramide.</p><p>Hyperprolactinemia may potentially stimulate prolactin-dependent breast cancer. However, some clinical studies and epidemiology studies have not shown an association between administration of dopamine D<span class="Sub">2</span> receptor antagonists and tumorigenesis in humans <span class="Italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].</span></p><h3>Effects on the Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery</h3><p class="First">Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Concomitant use of central nervous system (CNS) depressants or drugs associated with EPS may increase this effect (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics). Avoid Reglan or the interacting drug, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient <span class="Italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections of the labeling:</p><p>The following adverse reactions have been identified from clinical studies or postmarketing reports of metoclopramide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions (in approximately 10% of patients receiving 10 mg of metoclopramide four times daily) were restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, and lassitude. In general, the incidence of adverse reactions correlated with the dosage and duration of metoclopramide administration.</p><p>Adverse reactions, especially those involving the nervous system, occurred after stopping metoclopramide including dizziness, nervousness, and headaches.</p><p><span class="Bold">Central Nervous System Disorders</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Endocrine Disorders</span>: Fluid retention secondary to transient elevation of aldosterone.

No evidence of adverse developmental effects due to metoclopramide were observed.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited published data report the presence of metoclopramide in human milk in variable amounts. Breastfed infants exposed to metoclopramide have experienced gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including intestinal discomfort and increased intestinal gas formation <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>. Metoclopramide elevates prolactin levels <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]</span>; however, the published data are not adequate to support drug effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Reglan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Reglan or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p>Monitor breastfeeding neonates because metoclopramide may cause extrapyramidal signs (dystonias) and methemoglobinemia <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>In published clinical studies, the estimated amount of metoclopramide received by the breastfed infant was less than 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. In one study, the estimated daily amount of metoclopramide received by infants from breast milk ranged from 6 to 24 mcg/kg/day in early puerperium (3 to 9 days postpartum) and from 1 to 13 mcg/kg/day at 8 to 12 weeks postpartum.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">Reglan is not recommended for use in pediatric patients due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and other extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the risk of methemoglobinemia in neonates. The safety and effectiveness of Reglan in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><p>Dystonias and other extrapyramidal symptoms associated with metoclopramide are more common in pediatric patients than in adults <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]</span>. In addition, neonates have reduced levels of NADH-cytochrome b<span class="Sub">5</span> reductase, making them more susceptible to methemoglobinemia, a possible adverse reaction of metoclopramide use in neonates <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Metoclopramide is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions, including tardive dyskinesia (TD), may be greater in patients with impaired renal function <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function and may be more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide; therefore, consider a reduced dosage of Reglan in elderly patients <span class="Italics">[see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">The clearance of metoclopramide is decreased and the systemic exposure is increased in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Reduce the Reglan dosage in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 60 mL/minute), including those receiving hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span></p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have reduced systemic metoclopramide clearance (by approximately 50%) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. The resulting increase in metoclopramide blood concentrations increases the risk of adverse reactions. There is no pharmacokinetic data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B). Reduce Reglan dosage in patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]</span>. There is no dosage adjustment required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A).</p><p>In addition, metoclopramide, by producing a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, may increase the risk of fluid retention in patients with hepatic impairment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]</span>.</p><p>Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for the occurrence of fluid retention and volume overload.</p><h3>NADH-Cytochrome b5 Reductase Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Metoclopramide-treated patients with NADH-cytochrome b<span class="Sub">5</span> reductase deficiency are at an increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia and/or sulfhemoglobinemia. For patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with metoclopramide-induced methemoglobinemia, methylene blue treatment is not recommended. Methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, which may be fatal <span class="Italics">[see Overdosage (10)].</span></p><h3>CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers</h3><p class="First">Metoclopramide is a substrate of CYP2D6. The elimination of metoclopramide may be slowed in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (compared to patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate, extensive, or ultra-rapid metabolizers); possibly increasing the risk of dystonic and other adverse reactions to Reglan <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</span> Reduce the Reglan dosage in patients who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].</span></p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Manifestations of metoclopramide overdosage included drowsiness, disorientation, extrapyramidal reactions, other adverse reactions associated with metoclopramide use (including, e.g., methemoglobinemia), and sometimes death. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with metoclopramide overdose and concomitant treatment with another drug associated with NMS <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].</span></p><p>There are no specific antidotes for Reglan overdosage. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage <span class="Italics">.</span></p><p>Methemoglobinemia can be reversed by the intravenous administration of methylene blue. However, methylene blue may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which may be fatal.</p><p>Hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis do not remove significant amounts of metoclopramide.</p><h2>Reglan Tablets Description</h2><p class="First">Metoclopramide hydrochloride, the active ingredient of Reglan, is a dopamine-2 receptor antagonist. Metoclopramide hydrochloride (metoclopramide monohydrochloride monohydrate) is a white crystalline, odorless substance, freely soluble in water. Its chemical name is 4-amino-5-chloro-N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-2-methoxy benzamide monohydrochloride monohydrate.</p><p>The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">22</span>ClN<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>•HCl•H<span class="Sub">2</span>O. Its molecular weight is 354.3. The structural formula is:</p><p>Reglan Tablets are for oral administration. Reglan is available in 5 mg and 10 mg tablets.</p><h2>Reglan Tablets - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions. The exact mechanism of action of metoclopramide in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis has not been fully established. It seems to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. The effect of metoclopramide on motility is not dependent on intact vagal innervation, but it can be abolished by anticholinergic drugs.</p><p>Metoclopramide increases the tone and amplitude of gastric (especially antral) contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and the duodenal bulb, and increases peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter. It has little, if any, effect on the motility of the colon or gallbladder.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Gastroesophageal Reflux</span></p><p>In patients with gastroesophageal reflux and low lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), single oral doses of Reglan produced dose-related increases in LESP. Effects began at about 5 mg and increased through 20 mg. The increase in LESP from a 5 mg dose lasted about 45 minutes and that of 20 mg lasted between 2 and 3 hours. Increased rate of stomach emptying was observed with single oral doses of 10 mg.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute bioavailability of oral metoclopramide is 80% ± 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occurred at about 1 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak was observed after individual doses at steady state.</p><p>In a single dose study of 12 subjects, the area under the drug concentration-time curve increased linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg (5 times the maximum recommended single dose). Peak concentrations increased linearly with dose; time to peak concentrations remained the same; whole body clearance was unchanged; and the elimination rate remained the same. The mean elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function was 5 to 6 hours. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>Metoclopramide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg), which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues.</p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Drug Interaction Studies</span></p><p><span class="Bold">Table 5.

Metoclopramide elevated prolactin levels and the elevation persisted during chronic administration. An increase in mammary neoplasms was found in rodents after chronic administration of metoclopramide <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].</span> In a rat model for assessing the tumor promotion potential, a 2-week oral treatment with metoclopramide at a dose of 260 mg/kg/day (about 35 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) enhanced the tumorigenic effect of N-nitrosodiethylamine.</p><p><span class="Bold">Mutagenesis</span></p><p>Metoclopramide was positive in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Chinese hamster lung cell/HGPRT forward mutation assay for mutagenic effects and in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay for clastogenic effects. It was negative in the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> Ames mutation assay, the <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> unscheduled DNA synthesis assay with rat and human hepatocytes, and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> rat micronucleus assay.</p><p><span class="Bold">Impairment of Fertility</span></p><p>Metoclopramide at intramuscular doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (about three times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Each green, elliptical-shaped Reglan tablet contains 5 mg metoclopramide.
