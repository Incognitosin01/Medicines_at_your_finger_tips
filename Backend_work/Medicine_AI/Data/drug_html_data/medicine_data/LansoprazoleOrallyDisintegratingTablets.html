</ul><p><span class="Bold">Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets</span></p><p>• Do not break or cut. </p><p>• Place the tablet on the tongue, allow it to disintegrate, with or without water, until the microgranules can be swallowed. Do not chew the microgranules. </p><p>• The tablet typically disintegrates in less than one minute. • Alternatively, for children or other patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets, lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets can be administered with water via oral syringe or NG tube as follows:</p><p>Administration with Water in an Oral Syringe </p><p>1. Place a 15 mg tablet in oral syringe and draw up 4 mL of water, or place a 30 mg tablet in oral syringe and draw up 10 mL of water.</p><p>2. Shake gently to allow for a quick dispersal.</p><p>3. After the tablet has dispersed, administer the contents within 15 minutes of mixing into the mouth. Do not save the water and microgranule mixture for later use. </p><p>4. Refill the syringe with approximately 2 mL (5 mL for the 30 mg tablet) of water, shake gently, and administer any remaining contents.  </p><p>Administration with Water via a NG Tube (≥8 French) </p><p>1. Place a 15 mg tablet in a catheter-tip syringe and draw up 4 mL of water, or place a 30 mg tablet in a catheter-tip syringe and draw up 10 mL of water.</p><p>2. Shake gently to allow for a quick dispersal.</p><p>3. After the tablet has dispersed, shake the catheter-tip syringe gently in order to keep the microgranules from settling, and immediately inject the mixture through the NG tube into the stomach within 15 minutes of mixing. Do not save the water and microgranule mixture for later use.</p><p>4. Refill the catheter-tip syringe with approximately 5 mL of water, shake gently, and flush the tube.  </p><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">• Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets, 15 mg are white to off white, round, flat faced beveled edge, uncoated tablets with orange to dark brown colored speckles,debossed with ‘’ on one side and ‘15’ on the other side.</p><p>• Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets, 30 mg are white to off white, round, flat faced beveled edge, uncoated tablets with orange to dark brown colored speckles,debossed with ‘’ on one side and ‘30’ on the other side.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">• Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urticaria [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions</span> <span class="Bold">(5.2)</span>, <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions (6)</span>].</p><p>• Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs), including lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets, are contraindicated with rilpivirine-containing products [see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7)</span>].</p><p>• For information about contraindications of antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets, refer to the <span class="Italics">Contraindications</span> section of their prescribing information.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Presence of Gastric Malignancy</h3><p class="First">In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.</p><h3>5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Acute tubulointerstial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications (4)].</span></p><h3>5.3 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea</h3><p>Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets may be associated with an increased risk of <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-associated diarrhea (CDAD), especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span>(6.2)].</p><p>Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><p>CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets, refer to <span class="Italics">Warnings and Precautions</span> section of their prescribing information.</p><h3>5.4 Bone Fracture</h3><p class="First">Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see <span class="Bold">Dosage and Administration (2),Adverse Reactions (6.2)</span>].  </p><h3>5.5 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</h3><p class="First">Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including lansoprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.  </p><p>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.  </p><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI-associated SLE is usually milder than nondrug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.   </p><p>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in four to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</p><h3>5.6 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) Deficiency</h3><p class="First">Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo-or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets.</p><h3>5.7 Hypomagnesemia</h3><p class="First">Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.  </p><p>For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see <span class="Bold">Adverse Reactions</span> (6.2)].</p><h3>5.8 Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors</h3><p>Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop lansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7)</span>, <span class="Bold">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</span>].</p><h3>Interaction with Methotrexate</h3><p>Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see <span class="Bold">Drug Interactions (7),</span> <span class="Bold">Clin</span><span class="Bold">ical Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Patients with Phenylketonuria</h3><p class="First">Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 15 mg tablet contains 2.52 mg and each 30 mg tablet contains 5.04 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets.</p><h3>Fundic Gland Polyps</h3><p class="First">PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</p><h3>Risk of Heart Valve Thickening in Pediatric Patients Less Than One Year of Age</h3><p class="First"><span class="following_xmChange">Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets are not approved in pediatric patients less than one year of age. Nonclinical studies in juvenile rats with lansoprazole have demonstrated an adverse effect of heart valve thickening. The risk of heart valve injury does not appear to be relevant to patients one year of age and older [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling:</p><p>• Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.2)]</p><p>• <span class="Italics">Clostridium difficile</span>-Associated Diarrhea [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions</span>(5.3)]</p><p>• Bone Fracture [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.4)]</p><p>• Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.5)]</p><p>• Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) Deficiency [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.6)]</p><p>• Hypomagnesemia [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions</span> (5.7)]</p><p>• Fundic Gland Polyps [see <span class="Bold">Warnings and Precautions (5.11)</span>].</p><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>Worldwide, over 10,000 patients have been treated with lansoprazole in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials involving various dosages and durations of treatment. In general, lansoprazole treatment has been well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term trials. </p><p>The following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician to have a possible or probable relationship to drug in 1% or more of lansoprazole-treated patients and occurred at a greater rate in lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets-treated patients than placebo-treated patients in Table 1.</p><p>Headache was also seen at greater than 1% incidence but was more common on placebo. The incidence of diarrhea was similar between patients who received placebo and patients who received 15 and 30 mg of lansoprazole, but higher in the patients who received 60 mg of lansoprazole (2.9, 1.4, 4.2, and 7.4%, respectively).</p><p>The most commonly reported possibly or probably treatment-related adverse event during maintenance therapy was diarrhea.</p><p>In the risk reduction study of lansoprazole for NSAID-associated gastric ulcers, the incidence of diarrhea for patients treated with lansoprazole, misoprostol, and placebo was 5, 22, and 3%, respectively.</p><p>Another study for the same indication, where patients took either a COX-2 inhibitor or lansoprazole and naproxen, demonstrated that the safety profile was similar to the prior study. Additional reactions from this study not previously observed in other clinical trials with lansoprazole included contusion, duodenitis, epigastric discomfort, esophageal disorder, fatigue, hunger, hiatal hernia, hoarseness, impaired gastric emptying, metaplasia, and renal impairment.</p><p>Additional adverse experiences occurring in less than 1% of patients or subjects who received lansoprazole in domestic trials are shown below:</p><p><span class="Italics">Body as a Whole</span> – abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, asthenia, back pain, candidiasis, carcinoma, chest pain (not otherwise specified), chills, edema, fever, flu syndrome, halitosis, infection (not otherwise specified), malaise, neck pain, neck rigidity, pain, pelvic pain</p><p><span class="Italics">Cardiovascular System -</span> angina, arrhythmia, bradycardia, cerebrovascular accident/cerebral infarction, hypertension/hypotension, migraine, myocardial infarction, palpitations, shock (circulatory failure), syncope, tachycardia, vasodilation</p><p><span class="Italics">Digestive System –</span> abnormal stools, anorexia, bezoar, cardiospasm, cholelithiasis, colitis, dry mouth, dyspepsia, dysphagia, enteritis, eructation, esophageal stenosis, esophageal ulcer, esophagitis, fecal discoloration, flatulence, gastric nodules/fundic gland polyps, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal anomaly, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, glossitis, gum hemorrhage, hematemesis, increased appetite, increased salivation, melena, mouth ulceration, nausea and vomiting, nausea and vomiting and diarrhea, gastrointestinal moniliasis, rectal disorder, rectal hemorrhage, stomatitis, tenesmus, thirst, tongue disorder, ulcerative colitis, ulcerative stomatitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Endocrine System -</span> diabetes mellitus, goiter, hypothyroidism</p><p><span class="Italics">Hemic and Lymphatic System -</span> anemia, hemolysis, lymphadenopathy</p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders -</span> avitaminosis, gout, dehydration, hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia, peripheral edema, weight gain/loss</p><p><span class="Italics">Musculoskeletal System -</span> arthralgia, arthritis, bone disorder, joint disorder, leg cramps, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, myasthenia, ptosis, synovitis</p><p><span class="Italics">Nervous System –</span> abnormal dreams, agitation, amnesia, anxiety, apathy, confusion, convulsion, dementia, depersonalization, depression, diplopia, dizziness, emotional lability, hallucinations, hemiplegia, hostility aggravated, hyperkinesia, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, libido decreased/increased, nervousness, neurosis, paresthesia, sleep disorder, somnolence, thinking abnormality, tremor, vertigo</p><p><span class="Italics">Respiratory System -</span> asthma, bronchitis, cough increased, dyspnea, epistaxis, hemoptysis, hiccup, laryngeal neoplasia, lung fibrosis, pharyngitis, pleural disorder, pneumonia, respiratory disorder, upper respiratory inflammation/infection, rhinitis, sinusitis, stridor</p><p><span class="Italics">Skin and Appendages -</span> acne, alopecia, contact dermatitis, dry skin, fixed eruption, hair disorder, maculopapular rash, nail disorder, pruritus, rash, skin carcinoma, skin disorder, sweating, urticaria</p><p><span class="Italics">Special Senses –</span> abnormal vision, amblyopia, blepharitis, blurred vision, cataract, conjunctivitis, deafness, dry eyes, ear/eye disorder, eye pain, glaucoma, otitis media, parosmia, photophobia, retinal degeneration/disorder, taste loss, taste perversion, tinnitus, visual field defect</p><p><span class="Italics">Urogenital System -</span> abnormal menses, breast enlargement, breast pain, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea, dysuria, gynecomastia, impotence, kidney calculus, kidney pain, leukorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, penis disorder, polyuria, testis disorder, urethral pain, urinary frequency, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, urinary urgency, urination impaired, vaginitis.</p><h3>Postmarketing Experience</h3><p class="First">Additional adverse experiences have been reported since lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets have been marketed. The majority of these cases are foreign-sourced and a relationship to lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets has not been established.

Adverse reactions that have occurred have been limited to those that had been previously reported with lansoprazole, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Triple Therapy:</span> Lansoprazole/amoxicillin/clarithromycin</p><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions for patients who received triple therapy for 14 days were diarrhea (7%), headache (6%), and taste perversion (5%). There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of reported adverse reactions between the 10 and 14 day triple therapy regimens. No treatment-emergent adverse reactions were observed at significantly higher rates with triple therapy than with any dual therapy regimen.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Dual Therapy:</span> Lansoprazole/amoxicillin</p><p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions for patients who received lansoprazole three times daily plus amoxicillin three times daily dual therapy were diarrhea (8%) and headache (7%). No treatment-emergent adverse reactions were observed at significantly higher rates with lansoprazole three times daily plus amoxicillin three times daily dual therapy than with lansoprazole alone.</p><p>For information about adverse reactions with antibacterial agents (amoxicillin and clarithromycin) indicated in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets, refer to the <span class="Italics">Adverse Reactions</span> section of their prescribing information.</p><h3>Laboratory Values</h3><p class="First">The following changes in laboratory parameters in patients who received lansoprazole were reported as adverse reactions:</p><p>Abnormal liver function tests, increased SGOT (AST), increased SGPT (ALT), increased creatinine, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased globulins, increased GGTP, increased/decreased/abnormal WBC, abnormal AG ratio, abnormal RBC, bilirubinemia, blood potassium increased, blood urea increased, crystal urine present, eosinophilia, hemoglobin decreased, hyperlipemia, increased/decreased electrolytes, increased/decreased cholesterol, increased glucocorticoids, increased LDH, increased/decreased/abnormal platelets, increased gastrin levels and positive fecal occult blood.

There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a Relative Risk (RR) =1.04, [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.25 to 4.21]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to lansoprazole in 794 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations Odds Ratio (OR)=1.12, [95% CI 0.86 to 1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR=1.29, [95% CI 0.84 to 1.97]).</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>No adverse effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in studies performed in pregnant rats at oral lansoprazole doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (40 times the recommended human dose [30 mg/day] based on body surface area) administered during organogenesis and pregnant rabbits at oral lansoprazole doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) administered during organogenesis.  </p><p>A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with lansoprazole at oral doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg/day (0.7 to 6.4 times the maximum recommended human lansoprazole dose of 30 mg based on AUC [area under the plasma concentration-time curve]) administered during organogenesis through lactation. Maternal effects observed at 100 mg/kg/day (6.4 times the maximum recommended human lansoprazole dose of 30 mg based on AUC) included increased gestation period, decreased body weight gain during gestation, and decreased food consumption. The number of stillbirths was increased at this dose, which may have been secondary to maternal toxicity. Body weight of pups was reduced at 100 mg/kg/day starting on postnatal Day 11. Femur weight, femur length, and crown-rump length were reduced at 100 mg/kg/day on postnatal Day 21. Femur weight was still decreased in the 100 mg/kg/day group at age 17 to 18 weeks. Growth plate thickness was decreased in the 100 mg/kg/day males on postnatal Day 21, and was increased in the 30 and 100 mg/kg/day males at age 17 to 18 weeks.

In clinical studies of symptomatic GERD and erosive esophagitis, lansoprazole was not administered beyond 12 weeks in patients one year to 11 years of age. It is not known if lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets are safe and effective if used longer than the recommended duration. Do not exceed the recommended dose and duration of use in pediatric patients (see Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data).</p><p>Lansoprazole was not effective in pediatric patients with symptomatic GERD one month to less than one year of age in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Therefore, safety and effectiveness have not been established in patients less than one year of age.

Infants aged ≤10 weeks had clearance and exposure values that were similar to neonates. Infants aged greater than 10 weeks who received 1 mg/kg/day had mean AUC values that were similar to adults who received a 30 mg dose.  </p><p>Lansoprazole was not found to be effective in a U.S. and Polish four week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 162 patients between one month and less than 12 months of age with symptomatic GERD based on a medical history of crying/fussing/irritability associated with feedings who had not responded to conservative GERD management (i.e., nonpharmacologic intervention) for seven to 14 days. Patients received lansoprazole as a suspension daily (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in infants ≤10 weeks of age or 1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day in infants greater than 10 weeks or placebo) for up to four weeks of double-blind treatment.  </p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed by greater than 50% reduction from baseline in either the percent of feedings with a crying/fussing/irritability episode or the duration (minutes) of a crying/fussing/irritability episode within one hour after feeding.  </p><p>There was no difference in the percentage of responders between the lansoprazole pediatric suspension group and placebo group (54% in both groups).  </p><p>There were no adverse events reported in pediatric clinical studies (one month to less than 12 months of age) that were not previously observed in adults.  </p><p>Based on the results of the Phase 3 efficacy study, lansoprazole was not shown to be effective.

Heart valve thickening was observed primarily with oral dosing initiated on postnatal Day 7 (age equivalent to neonatal humans) and postnatal Day 14 (human age equivalent of approximately one year) at doses of 250 mg/kg/day and higher (at postnatal Day 7 and postnatal Day 14, respectively 6.2 times and 4.2 times the daily pediatric dose of 15 mg in pediatric patients age one to 11 years weighing 30 kg or less, based on AUC). The treatment durations associated with heart valve thickening ranged from 5 days to 8 weeks. The findings reversed or trended towards reversibility after a 4-week drug-free recovery period. The incidence of heart valve thickening after initiation of dosing on postnatal Day 21 (human age equivalent of approximately two years) was limited to a single rat (1/24) in groups given 500 mg/kg/day for 4 or 8 weeks (approximately 5.2 times the daily pediatric dose of 15 mg in pediatric patients age one to 11 years weighing 30 kg or less, based on AUC).

At the end of treatment, the signs of impaired growth at 100 mg/kg/day and higher included reductions in body weight (14 to 44% compared to controls), absolute weight of multiple organs, femur weight, femur length, and crown-rump length. Femoral growth plate thickness was reduced only in males and only at the 500 mg/kg/day dose. The effects related to delayed growth persisted through the end of the four-week recovery period. Longer term data were not collected.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Of the total number of patients (n=21,486) in clinical studies of lansoprazole, 16% of patients were aged 65 years and over, while 4% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients and other reported clinical experience has not identified significant differences in responses between geriatric and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see <span class="Bold">Clinical</span> <span class="Bold">Pharmacology (12.3)</span>].</p><h3>Hepatic Impairment</h3><p class="First">In patients with various degrees of chronic hepatic impairment the exposure to lansoprazole was increased compared to healthy subjects with normal hepatic function <span class="Bold">[</span>see <span class="Bold">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. No dosage adjustment for lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets is necessary for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.

Its empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">16</span>H<span class="Sub">14</span>F<span class="Sub">3</span>N<span class="Sub">3</span>O<span class="Sub">2</span>S with a molecular weight of 369.37. Lansoprazole USP has the following structure:</p><p>Lansoprazole USP is a white to brownish-white powder which melts with decomposition at approximately 166°C. Lansoprazole USP is freely soluble in dimethylformamide and practically insoluble in water.  </p><p>Lansoprazole USP is stable when exposed to light for up to two months. The rate of degradation of the compound in aqueous solution increases with decreasing pH. The degradation half-life of the drug substance in aqueous solution at 25°C is approximately 0.5 hour at pH 5.0 and approximately 18 hours at pH 7.0.  </p><p>Lansoprazole USP is supplied as delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets for oral administration.  </p><p>Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets are available in two dosage strengths: 15 and 30 mg of lansoprazole USP per tablet.

Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, lansoprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Lansoprazole does not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine type-2 antagonist activity.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p><span class="Bold">Antisecretory Activity</span></p><p>After oral administration, lansoprazole was shown to significantly decrease the basal acid output and significantly increase the mean gastric pH and percent of time the gastric pH was greater than three and greater than four. Lansoprazole also significantly reduced meal-stimulated gastric acid output and secretion volume, as well as pentagastrin-stimulated acid output. In patients with hypersecretion of acid, lansoprazole significantly reduced basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Lansoprazole inhibited the normal increases in secretion volume, acidity and acid output induced by insulin.  </p><p>The intragastric pH results of a five day, pharmacodynamic, crossover study of 15 and 30 mg of once daily lansoprazole are presented in Table 6.</p><p>NOTE: An intragastric pH of greater than four reflects a reduction in gastric acid by 99%.</p><p>* (p&lt;0.05) vs baseline only. </p><p><span class="Sup">†</span>(p&lt;0.05) vs baseline and lansoprazole 15 mg.  </p><p>After the initial dose in this study, increased gastric pH was seen within one to two hours with 30 mg of lansoprazole and two to three hours with 15 mg of lansoprazole. After multiple daily dosing, increased gastric pH was seen within the first hour post-dosing with 30 mg of lansoprazole and within one to two hours postdosing with 15 mg of lansoprazole.  </p><p>Acid suppression may enhance the effect of antimicrobials in eradicating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

There was no indication of rebound gastric acidity.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cell Effects</span></p><p>During lifetime exposure of rats with up to 150 mg/kg/day of lansoprazole dosed seven days per week, marked hypergastrinemia was observed followed by ECL cell proliferation and formation of carcinoid tumors, especially in female rats. Gastric biopsy specimens from the body of the stomach from approximately 150 patients treated continuously with lansoprazole for at least one year did not show evidence of ECL cell effects similar to those seen in rat studies. Longer term data are needed to rule out the possibility of an increased risk of the development of gastric tumors in patients receiving long-term therapy with lansoprazole [see <span class="Bold">Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</span>].  </p><p><span class="Bold">Other Gastric Effects in Humans</span></p><p>Lansoprazole did not significantly affect mucosal blood flow in the fundus of the stomach. Due to the normal physiologic effect caused by the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, a decrease of about 17% in blood flow in the antrum, pylorus, and duodenal bulb was seen. Lansoprazole significantly slowed the gastric emptying of digestible solids. Lansoprazole increased serum pepsinogen levels and decreased pepsin activity under basal conditions and in response to meal stimulation or insulin injection. As with other agents that elevate intragastric pH, increases in gastric pH were associated with increases in nitrate-reducing bacteria and elevation of nitrite concentration in gastric juice in patients with gastric ulcer. No significant increase in nitrosamine concentrations was observed.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Serum Gastrin Effects</span></p><p>In over 2,100 patients, median fasting serum gastrin levels increased 50 to 100% from baseline but remained within normal range after treatment with 15 to 60 mg of oral lansoprazole. These elevations reached a plateau within two months of therapy and returned to pretreatment levels within four weeks after discontinuation of therapy.  </p><p>Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum CgA levels.

Lansoprazole in oral doses of 15 to 60 mg for up to one year had no clinically significant effect on sexual function. In addition, lansoprazole in oral doses of 15 to 60 mg for two to eight weeks had no clinically significant effect on thyroid function. In 24 month carcinogenicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rats with daily lansoprazole dosages up to 150 mg/kg, proliferative changes in the Leydig cells of the testes, including benign neoplasm, were increased compared to control rats.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Other Effects</span></p><p>No systemic effects of lansoprazole on the central nervous system, lymphoid, hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems have been found in humans. Among 56 patients who had extensive baseline eye evaluations, no visual toxicity was observed after lansoprazole treatment (up to 180 mg/day) for up to 58 months. After lifetime lansoprazole exposure in rats, focal pancreatic atrophy, diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia in the thymus, and spontaneous retinal atrophy were seen.  </p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption:</span></p><p>Lansoprazole delayed-release orally disintegrating tablets contain an enteric-coated granule formulation of lansoprazole (because lansoprazole is acid-labile), so that absorption of lansoprazole begins only after the granules leave the stomach. The mean peak plasma levels of lansoprazole occur at approximately 1.7 hours. After a single-dose administration of 15 to 60 mg of oral lansoprazole, the peak plasma concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of lansoprazole and the area under the plasma concentration curves (AUCs) of lansoprazole were approximately proportional to the administered dose. Lansoprazole does not accumulate and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered by multiple dosing. The absolute bioavailability is over 80%. In healthy subjects, the mean (±SD) plasma half-life was 1.5 (±1) hours. Both the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC are diminished by about 50 to 70% if lansoprazole is given 30 minutes after food, compared to the fasting condition. There is no significant food effect if lansoprazole is given before meals.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span>:</p><p>Lansoprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 0.05 to 5 mcg/mL.  </p><p><span class="Bold">Elimination:</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Metabolism:</span> Lansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver. Two metabolites have been identified in measurable quantities in plasma (the hydroxylated sulfinyl and sulfone derivatives of lansoprazole). These metabolites have very little or no antisecretory activity. Lansoprazole is thought to be transformed into two active species which inhibit acid secretion by blocking the proton pump [(H<span class="Sup">+</span>, K<span class="Sup">+</span>)-ATPase enzyme system] at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. The two active species are not present in the systemic circulation. The plasma elimination half-life of lansoprazole is less than two hours while the acid inhibitory effect lasts more than 24 hours. Therefore, the plasma elimination half-life of lansoprazole does not reflect its duration of suppression of gastric acid secretion.  </p><p><span class="Italics">Excretion:</span> Following single-dose oral administration of lansoprazole, virtually no unchanged lansoprazole was excreted in the urine. In one study, after a single oral dose of <span class="Sup">14</span>C-lansoprazole, approximately one-third of the administered radiation was excreted in the urine and two-thirds was recovered in the feces. This implies a significant biliary excretion of the lansoprazole metabolites.</p><p><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Pediatric Patient</span>s:</p><p><span class="Italics Underline">One to 17 years of age</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were studied in pediatric patients with GERD aged one to 11 years and 12 to 17 years in two separate clinical studies.
