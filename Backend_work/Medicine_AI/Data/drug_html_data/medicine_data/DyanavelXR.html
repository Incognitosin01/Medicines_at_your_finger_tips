Lisdexamfetamine gets converted into dexamphetamine once it is in the body. One advantage of Vyvanse is that it may be less likely to be abused; however, there is no generic form available so it is more costly than Adderall. Because both drugs contain amphetamines, they work in a similar way. Studies have shown that Vyvanse is just as effective as Adderall, and side effects, including the risk of dependence, are similar.</p><p>  Continue reading</p><p>Adzenys ER is an extended-release 1.25mg/mL liquid suspension compared to most other brands of amphetamine which are tablet and capsule formulations.
