</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Orfadin Suspension</h2><p class="First">ORFADIN<span class="Sup">®</span> is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1) in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine.</p><h2>Orfadin Suspension Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Dosage</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Starting Dosage</span></p><p>The recommended starting dosage of ORFADIN is 0.5 mg/kg administered orally twice daily</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Maintenance Regimen</span></p><p>In patients 5 years of age and older who have undetectable serum and urine succinylacetone concentrations after a minimum of 4 weeks on a stable dosage of nitisinone, the total daily dose of ORFADIN may be given once daily (e.g., 1 to 2 mg/kg once daily) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dosage Titration</span></p><p>Titrate the dosage in each individual patient based on biochemical and/or clinical response.</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Monitor plasma and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations, liver function parameters and alpha-fetoprotein levels.</li>
<li>If succinylacetone is still detectable in blood or urine 4 weeks after the start of nitisinone treatment, increase the nitisinone dosage to 0.75 mg/kg twice daily. A maximum total daily dosage of 2 mg/kg may be needed based on the evaluation of all biochemical parameters.</li>
<li>If the biochemical response is satisfactory (undetectable blood and/or urine succinylacetone), the dosage should be adjusted only according to body weight gain and not according to plasma tyrosine levels.</li>
<li>During initiation of therapy, when switching from twice daily to once daily dosing, or if there is a deterioration in the patient's condition, it may be necessary to follow all available biochemical parameters more closely (i.e. plasma and/or urine succinylacetone, urine 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) and erythrocyte porphobilinogen (PBG)-synthase activity).</li>
<li>Maintain plasma tyrosine levels below 500 micromol/L by dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine intake <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>. In patients who develop plasma tyrosine levels above 500 micromol/L, assess dietary tyrosine and phenylalanine intake. Do not adjust the ORFADIN dosage in order to lower the plasma tyrosine concentration.</li>

<li>Maintain dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine when taking ORFADIN.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Capsules:</span> Take at least one hour before, or two hours after a meal <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>. For patients who have difficulty swallowing the capsules and who are intolerant to the oral suspension <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span>, the capsules may be opened and the contents suspended in a small amount of water, formula or apple sauce immediately before use.</li>
<li><span class="Italics">Oral suspension:</span> Take without regard to meals <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</span>.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><ul class="Disc">
<li>Capsules: 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg white capsules imprinted with “NTBC” followed by “2 mg”, “5 mg”, “10 mg” or ”20 mg”, indicating the actual amount of nitisinone in each capsule.</li>
<li>Oral suspension: 4 mg/mL, a white, slightly viscous opaque suspension.</li>
</ul><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None.</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Elevated Plasma Tyrosine Levels, Ocular Symptoms, Developmental Delay and Hyperkeratotic Plaques</h3><p class="First">Nitisinone is an inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme in the tyrosine metabolic pathway <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</span>. Therefore, treatment with ORFADIN may cause an increase in plasma tyrosine levels in patients with HT-1. Maintain concomitant reduction in dietary tyrosine and phenylalanine while on ORFADIN treatment. Do not adjust ORFADIN dosage in order to lower the plasma tyrosine concentration. Maintain plasma tyrosine levels below 500 micromol/L. Inadequate restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine intake can lead to elevations in plasma tyrosine levels and levels greater than 500 micromol/L may lead to the following:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Ocular signs and symptoms including corneal ulcers, corneal opacities, keratitis, conjunctivitis, eye pain, and photophobia have been reported in patients treated with ORFADIN <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. In a clinical study in a non HT-1 population without dietary restriction and reported tyrosine levels &gt;500 micromol/l both symptomatic and asymptomatic keratopathies have been observed. Therefore, perform a baseline ophthalmologic examination including slit-lamp examination prior to initiating ORFADIN treatment and regularly thereafter. Patients who develop photophobia, eye pain, or signs of inflammation such as redness, swelling, or burning of the eyes or tyrosine levels are &gt; 500 micromol/L during treatment with ORFADIN should undergo slit-lamp reexamination and immediate measurement of the plasma tyrosine concentration.</li>
<li>Variable degrees of intellectual disability and developmental delay. In patients treated with ORFADIN who exhibit an abrupt change in neurologic status, perform a clinical laboratory assessment including plasma tyrosine levels.</li>
<li>Painful hyperkeratotic plaques on the soles and palms</li>
</ul><p>In patients with HT-1 treated with dietary restrictions and ORFADIN who develop elevated plasma tyrosine levels, assess dietary tyrosine and phenylalanine intake.</p><h3>Leukopenia and Severe Thrombocytopenia</h3><p class="First">In clinical trials, patients treated with ORFADIN and dietary restriction developed transient leukopenia (3%), thrombocytopenia (3%), or both (1.5%) <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>. No patients developed infections or bleeding as a result of the episodes of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor platelet and white blood cell counts during ORFADIN therapy.</p><h3>Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Glycerol Content of ORFADIN Oral Suspension</h3><p class="First">Oral doses of glycerol of 10 grams or more have been reported to cause headache, upset stomach and diarrhea. ORFADIN oral suspension contains 500 mg/mL of glycerol. Patients receiving more than 20 mL of ORFADIN oral suspension (10 grams glycerol) as a single dose are at increased risk of these adverse reactions. Consider switching patients who are unable to tolerate the oral suspension to ORFADIN capsules.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</p><p>ORFADIN was studied in one open-label, uncontrolled study of 207 patients with HT-1, ages 0 to 22 years at enrollment (median age 9 months), who were diagnosed with HT-1 by the presence of succinylacetone in the urine or plasma. The starting dose of ORFADIN was 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was increased in some patients to 1 mg/kg twice daily based on weight, biochemical, and enzyme markers. The recommended starting dosage of ORFADIN is 0.5 mg/kg twice daily <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>. Median duration of treatment was 22 months (range 0.1 to 80 months).</p><p>The most serious adverse reactions reported during ORFADIN treatment were thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, porphyria, and ocular/visual complaints associated with elevated tyrosine levels <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]</span>. Fourteen patients experienced ocular/visual events. The duration of the symptoms varied from 5 days to 2 years. Six patients had thrombocytopenia, three of which had platelet counts 30,000/microL or lower. In 4 patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet counts gradually returned to normal (duration up to 47 days) without change in ORFADIN dose. No patients developed infections or bleeding as a result of the episodes of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.</p><p>Patients with HT- 1 are at increased risk of developing porphyric crises, hepatic neoplasms, and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. These complications of HT-1 were observed in patients treated with nitisinone for a median of 22 months during the clinical trial (liver transplantation 13%, liver failure 7%, malignant hepatic neoplasms 5%, benign hepatic neoplasms 3%, porphyria 1%).</p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported in the clinical trial are summarized in Table 1.</p><p class="First Footnote">*reported in at least 1% of patients</p><p>Adverse reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients, included death, seizure, brain tumor, encephalopathy, hyperkinesia, cyanosis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, enanthema, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, elevated hepatic enzymes, liver enlargement, hypoglycemia, septicemia, and bronchitis.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p class="First">Nitisinone is a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, a weak CYP2E1 inducer and an inhibitor of OAT1/OAT3. Table 2 includes drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with ORFADIN and instructions for preventing or managing them.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Limited available data with nitisinone use in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have been conducted for nitisinone. In these studies, nitisinone was administered to mice and rabbits during organogenesis with oral doses of nitisinone up to 20 and 8 times respectively, the recommended initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day. In mice, nitisinone caused incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones and decreased pup survival at doses 0.4 times the recommended initial dose, and increased gestational length at doses 4 times the recommended initial dose. In rabbits, nitisinone caused maternal toxicity and incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones at doses 1.6 times the recommended initial dose <span class="Italics">[see Data]</span>.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Reproduction studies have been performed in mice at oral doses of about 0.4, 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose (1 mg/kg/day) and in rabbits at oral doses of about 1.6, 4 and 8 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area. In mice, nitisinone has been shown to cause incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones at 0.4, 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose, increased gestational length at 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose, and decreased pup survival at 0.4 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area. In rabbits, nitisinone caused incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones at 1.6, 4 and 8 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>There are no data on the presence of nitisinone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Data suggest that nitisinone is present in rat milk due to findings of ocular toxicity and lower body weight seen in drug naive nursing rat pups. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ORFADIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ORFADIN or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of ORFADIN have been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of HT-1 in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine. Use of ORFADIN in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from one open-label, uncontrolled clinical study conducted in 207 patients with HT-1 ages 0 to 22 years (median age 9 months) <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of nitisinone did not include any subjects aged 65 and over. No pharmacokinetic studies of nitisinone have been performed in geriatric patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy in this patient population.</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">Accidental ingestion of ORFADIN by individuals eating normal diets not restricted in tyrosine and phenylalanine will result in elevated tyrosine levels. In healthy subjects given a single 1 mg/kg dose of nitisinone, the plasma tyrosine level reached a maximum of 1200 micromol/L at 48 to 120 hours after dosing. After a washout period of 14 days, the mean value of plasma tyrosine was still 808 micromol/L. Fasted follow-up samples obtained from volunteers several weeks later showed tyrosine values back to normal. There were no reports of changes in vital signs or laboratory data of any clinical significance. One patient reported sensitivity to sunlight. Hyper-tyrosinemia has been reported with ORFADIN treatment <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><h2>Orfadin Suspension Description</h2><p class="First">ORFADIN contains nitisinone, which is a hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1).</p><p>Nitisinone occurs as white to yellowish-white, crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in water, soluble in 2M sodium hydroxide and in methanol, and sparingly soluble in alcohol.</p><p>Chemically, nitisinone is 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl) cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the structural formula is:</p><p class="MultiMediaCaption">Figure 1. The molecular formula is C<span class="Sub">14</span>H<span class="Sub">10</span>F<span class="Sub">3</span>NO<span class="Sub">5</span> with a relative mass of 329.23</p><p>Capsules: Hard, white-opaque capsule, marked as 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg strengths of nitisinone, intended for oral administration. Each capsule contains 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg nitisinone, plus pre-gelatinized starch. The capsule shell is gelatin and titanium dioxide and the imprint is an iron oxide.</p><p>Oral suspension: 4 mg/mL, a white, slightly viscous opaque suspension. The inactive ingredients are hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, glycerol, polysorbate 80, sodium benzoate, citric acid monohydrate, trisodium citrate dihydrate, strawberry aroma (artificial) and purified water.</p><p>Glycerol: Each mL contains 500 mg.</p><p>Sodium: Each mL contains 0.7 mg (0.03 mEq).</p><h2>Orfadin Suspension - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Nitisinone is a competitive inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme upstream of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in patients with HT-1, nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the catabolic intermediates maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate. In patients with HT-1, these catabolic intermediates are converted to the toxic metabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate, which are responsible for the observed liver and kidney toxicity. Succinylacetone can also inhibit the porphyrin synthesis pathway leading to the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinate, a neurotoxin responsible for the porphyric crises characteristic of HT-1.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">In a clinical study, patients with HT-1 were diagnosed by the presence of succinylacetone in urine or plasma and treated with ORFADIN <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. In all 186 patients whose urine succinylacetone was measured, the urinary succinylacetone concentration decreased to less than 1 mmol/mol creatinine, the lower limit of quantitation. The median time to normalization of urine succinylacetone was 0.3 months. The probability of recurrence of abnormal values of urine succinylacetone was 1% at a nitisinone concentration of 37 micromol/L (95% confidence interval: 23, 51 micromol/L). In 87% (150/172) of patients whose plasma succinylacetone was measured, the plasma succinylacetone concentration decreased to less than 0.1 micromol/L, the lower limit of quantitation. The median time to normalization of plasma succinylacetone was 3.9 months.</p><p>In another study, comparing two dosing regimens, succinylacetone was measured in urine and/or blood in 16 patients with HT-1 aged 5 years to 24 years. All study patients were on a stable ORFADIN daily dosage (0.4 mg/kg/day to 1 mg/kg/day) during both study dosing regimens. After at least 4 weeks of twice daily dosing with ORFADIN, both the urine and/or blood succinylacetone concentrations were below the limit of quantitation for the assay. Patients were then switched to once daily dosing with the same total daily dosage of ORFADIN and blood and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations remained undetectable when measured following at least 4 weeks of treatment with once daily dosing.</p><p>Nitisinone inhibits catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine and can result in elevated plasma levels of tyrosine. Therefore, treatment with nitisinone requires restriction of the dietary intake of tyrosine and phenylalanine to prevent the toxicity associated with elevated plasma levels of tyrosine <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</span></p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The single-dose pharmacokinetics of nitisinone have been studied for both ORFADIN capsules and ORFADIN oral suspension in healthy adult subjects and the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics have been studied for ORFADIN capsules in healthy subjects.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>The pharmacokinetic characteristics following single oral administration of ORFADIN 30 mg under fasting conditions are shown in Table 3. Compared to ORFADIN capsule, the median T<span class="Sub">max</span> occurred about 3 hours earlier with ORFADIN oral suspension. The multiple-dose characteristics of ORFADIN 80 mg once daily are shown in Table 4. Steady-state (SS) was reached within 14 days dosing in all subjects.</p><p class="First Footnote">* presented as median [range]</p><p class="First Footnote">* presented as median [range]</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Food Effect:</span> No food effect study was conducted with ORFADIN capsules. For ORFADIN oral suspension, a high calorie (800 to 1000 calories) and high fat meal (approximately 50% of total caloric content) did not affect nitisinone total exposure (AUC<span class="Sub">72h</span>), but decreased the C<span class="Sub">max</span> by approximately 20% <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p><span class="Italics">In vitro</span> binding of nitisinone to human plasma proteins is greater than 95% at 50 micromolar concentration.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Elimination</span></p><p>The mean terminal plasma half-life of single dose nitisinone in healthy male subjects is 54 hours. The mean (CV%)apparent plasma clearance in 18 healthy adults following multiple once daily doses of ORFADIN 80 mg is  113 (16) mL/hr.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Metabolism: In vitro</span> studies have shown that nitisinone is relatively stable in human liver microsomes with minor metabolism possibly mediated by CYP3A4 enzyme.</p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Excretion:</span> Renal elimination of nitisinone is of minor importance, since the mean of the fraction of dose excreted as unchanged nitisinone in the urine (fe(%)) was 3.0% (n=3) following multiple oral doses of 80 mg daily in healthy subjects.

Nitisinone does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6 or 3A4/5. Nitisinone does not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT2-mediated transports at therapeutically relevant concentrations.</p><h2>Nonclinical Toxicology</h2><h3>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h3><p class="First">The carcinogenic potential of nitisinone was assessed in a 26-week oral (gavage) carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 mice. There were no drug-related neoplastic findings in male or female Tg.rasH2 mice at doses up to 100 mg/kg/ day nitisinone (approximately 8.1 times the recommended initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day on a body surface area basis).</p><p>Nitisinone was not genotoxic in the Ames test and the <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse liver unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test. Nitisinone was mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK<span class="Sup">+/-</span>) forward mutation test and in an <span class="Italics">in vivo</span> mouse bone marrow micronucleus test.</p><p>In a single dose-group study in rats given 100 mg/kg (16.2 times the recommended initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day on a body surface area basis), reduced litter size, decreased pup weight at birth, and decreased survival of pups after birth was demonstrated.</p><h2>Clinical Studies</h2><p class="First">The efficacy and safety of ORFADIN in patients with HT-1 was evaluated in one open-label, uncontrolled study of 207 patients with HT-1, ages 0 to 22 years at enrollment (median age 9 months). Patients were diagnosed with HT-1 by the presence of succinylacetone in the urine or plasma. All patients were treated with ORFADIN at a starting dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was increased in some patients to 1 mg/kg twice daily based on weight, liver and kidney function tests, platelet count, serum amino acids, urinary phenolic acid, plasma and urine succinylacetone, erythrocyte PBG-synthase, and urine 5-ALA. The median duration of treatment was 22 months (range less than 1 month to 80 months). Efficacy was assessed by comparison of survival and incidence of liver transplant to historical controls.</p><p>For patients presenting with HT-1 younger than 2 months of age who were treated with dietary restriction and nitisinone, 2- and 4-year survival probabilities were 88% and 88%, respectively. Data from historical controls showed that patients presenting with HT-1 at younger than 2 months of age and treated with dietary restriction alone had 2- and 4-year survival probabilities of 29% and 29%, respectively. For patients presenting with HT-1 between 2 months and 6 months of age who were treated with dietary restriction and nitisinone, 2- and 4-year survival probabilities were 94% and 94%, respectively. Data for historical controls showed that patients presenting with HT-1 between 2 months and 6 months of age treated with dietary restriction alone had 2- and 4-year survival probabilities of 74% and 60%, respectively.</p><p>The effects of nitisinone on urine and plasma succinylacetone, porphyrin metabolism, and urinary alpha-1-microglobulin were also assessed in this clinical study.</p><p>Porphyria-like crisis were reported in 3 patients (0.3% of cases per year) during the clinical study. This compares to an incidence of 5 to 20% of cases per year expected as part of the natural history of the disorder. An assessment of porphyria-like crises was performed because these events are commonly reported in patients with HT-1 who are not treated with nitisinone.</p><p>Urinary alpha-1-microglobulin, a proposed marker of proximal tubular dysfunction, was measured in 100 patients at baseline. The overall median pretreatment level was 4.3 grams/mol creatinine. After one year of treatment in a subgroup of patients (N=100), overall median alpha-1-microglobulin decreased by 1.5 grams/mol creatinine. In patients 24 months of age and younger in whom multiple values were available (N=65), median alpha-1-microglobulin levels decreased from 5.0 to 3.0 grams/mol creatinine (reference value for age less than or equal to 12 grams/mol creatinine). In patients older than 24 months in whom multiple values were available (N=35), median alpha-1-microglobulin levels decreased from 2.8 to 2.0 grams/mol creatinine (reference for age less than or equal to 6 grams/mol creatinine).</p><p>The long term effect of nitisinone on hepatic function was not assessed.</p><h2>How Supplied/Storage and Handling</h2><p class="First">Capsules: White capsules marked in black with "NTBC" and identified as 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg strengths of nitisinone.
