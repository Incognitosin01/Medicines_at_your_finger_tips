These blood clots can travel to the lungs and can become lodged in the blood vessels of the lungs, causing a condition called pulmonary embolism. Danaparoid is used for several days after hip replacement surgery, while you are unable to walk. It is during this time that blood clots are most likely to form. Danaparoid also may be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.</p><p>Danaparoid was available only with your doctor's prescription.</p><p>Organon, Inc. discontinued manufacturing Orgaran® (danaparoid) on August 14, 2002 .</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="before-taking">Before using danaparoid</h2><p>In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.
