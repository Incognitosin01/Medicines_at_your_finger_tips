</ul><h2>Description:</h2><p class="First">Atopica (cyclosporine capsules, USP) MODIFIED is an oral form of cyclosporine that</p><p>immediately forms a microemulsion in an aqueous environment. Cyclosporine, the active</p><p>ingredient in Atopica, is a cyclic polypeptide, immune modulating agent consisting of 11</p><p>amino acids. It is produced as a metabolite by the fungal species <span class="Italics">Beauveria nivea</span>.</p><p>Chemically, cyclosporine A is designated [R-[R*,R*-(E)]]-cyclic-(L-alanyl-D-alanyl-<span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl-</p><p>L-leucyl-<span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl-L-leucyl-<span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl-L-valyl-3-hydroxy-<span class="Italics">N</span>, 4-dimethyl-L-2amino-</p><p>6-octenoyl-L- Î± -amino-butyryl-<span class="Italics">N</span>-methylglycyl-<span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl-L-leucyl-L-valyl-<span class="Italics">N</span>-methyl-</p><p>L-leucyl). The structural formula is:</p><p></p><p>Atopica capsules contain cyclosporine formulated together with inactive ingredients.</p><p>Atopica is available in 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg capsule strengths in color-coded packaging</p><p>for oral administration to dogs.</p><h2>Indications:</h2><p class="First">Atopica is indicated for the control of atopic dermatitis in dogs weighing at least 4 lbs</p><p>body weight.</p><h2>Dosage and Administration:</h2><p class="First">The initial daily dose of Atopica is 5 mg/kg/day (3.3-6.7 mg/kg/day) as a single daily</p><p>dose for 30 days. Following this initial daily treatment period, the dose of Atopica</p><p>may be tapered by decreasing the frequency of dosing to every other day or two</p><p>times a week, until a minimum frequency is reached which will maintain the desired</p><p>therapeutic effect. Atopica should be given at least one hour before or two hours</p><p>after a meal. If a dose is missed, the next dose should be administered (without doubling)</p><p>as soon as possible, but dosing should be no more frequent than once daily.</p><h2>Dose Administration</h2><p class="First"></p><h2>Contraindications:</h2><p class="First">Atopica is contraindicated for use in dogs with a history of neoplasia.</p><h2>WARNINGS:</h2><p class="First">Atopica (cyclosporine) is a potent systemic immunosuppressant that may increase the</p><p>susceptibility to infection and the development of neoplasia.</p><h3>Human Warnings:</h3><p class="First">Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of reach of children. <span class="Bold">For use only in dogs</span>.</p><h2>Precautions:</h2><p class="First">Gastrointestinal problems and gingival hyperplasia may occur at the initial recommended</p><p>dose (See <span class="Italics">Animal Safety</span>).</p><p>Atopica should be used with caution with drugs that affect the P-450 enzyme system.</p><p>Simultaneous administration of Atopica with drugs that suppress the P-450 enzyme</p><p>system, such as ketoconazole, may lead to increased plasma levels of cyclosporine.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Atopica has not been established in dogs less than 6</p><p>months of age or less than 4 lbs body weight. Atopica is not for use in breeding</p><p>dogs, pregnant or lactating bitches.</p><p>Since the effect of cyclosporine use on dogs with compromised renal function has not</p><p>been studied, Atopica should be used with caution in dogs with renal insufficiency.</p><p>There have been reports of convulsions in human adult and pediatric patients receiving</p><p>cyclosporine, particularly in combination with high dose methylprednisolone (See</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Safety</span>).</p><p>Killed vaccines are recommended for dogs receiving Atopica because the impact of</p><p>cyclosporine on the immune response to modified live vaccines is unknown (See</p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Safety</span>).</p><p>As with any immunomodulation regimen, exacerbation of sub-clinical neoplastic conditions</p><p>may occur.</p><h2>Effectiveness Field Study:</h2><p class="First">A multisite, placebo controlled, double masked, field study was conducted in the</p><p>United States and Canada using 16 investigators. Two hundred sixty five (265) dogs</p><p>aged 1-10 years, weighing 4-121 lbs received either Atopica capsules at 5 mg/kg/day</p><p>or placebo capsules. After 30 days, placebo dogs were switched to Atopica capsules.</p><p>Dogs were treated with Atopica capsules for a total of 4 months. No additional therapy</p><p>with antihistamines, corticosteroids or medicated shampoos was permitted.</p><p>Evaluations for pruritus and for skin lesions to derive a Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent</p><p>and Severity Index (CADESI) score occurred at enrollment and at monthly intervals. One</p><p>hundred ninety-two (192) dogs were included in the statistical analysis of effectiveness.</p><p>At the end of the 30 day placebo controlled period, CADESI scores of dogs treated with</p><p>Atopica capsules improved by 45% from enrollment, while CADESI scores of dogs</p><p>treated with placebo worsened by 9%. Seventy-four (74)% of Atopica treated dogs</p><p>showed improvement in their pruritus scores over the first 30 day period, while only</p><p>24% of the placebo treated dogs showed an improvement. Owner and Veterinary</p><p>Global Assessment in response to treatment also demonstrated statistically significant</p><p>(p&lt;0.0001) improvement. After 4 weeks of therapy, Owner and Veterinary Global</p><p>Assessments showed approximately twice as much improvement in the Atopica treated</p><p>dogs as compared to placebo treated dogs.</p><p>Improvements in pruritus accompanied by 50% or 75% improvements in CADESI</p><p>scores resulted in dose reductions to every other day or twice weekly respectively. Not</p><p>all dogs were able to decrease to twice weekly dosing. Some animals required upward</p><p>or downward dosage adjustments during the study. Such adjustments should be</p><p>expected during therapy of this disease. Dogs unable to decrease from once daily dosing</p><p>after 60 days were considered dose reduction failures for the purposes of the study.</p><p>The results of dose assignments, based on the study criteria, for each 4-week dosing</p><p>period, are shown in the graph below.</p><p></p><p>Analysis of blood levels of cyclosporine drawn during the study demonstrated no</p><p>correlation between blood cyclosporine levels and CADESI scores or pruritus; therefore</p><p>monitoring blood cyclosporine levels is not an appropriate predictor of effectiveness.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions:</h2><p class="First">A total of 265 dogs were included in the field study safety analysis. One hundred and</p><p>eleven (111) dogs were treated with placebo for the first 30 days. For the remainder of</p><p>the study, all dogs received Atopica capsules.</p><p>Fourteen dogs withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Four dogs withdrew</p><p>from the study after vomiting. One dog each withdrew from the study after diarrhea;</p><p>vomiting, diarrhea and pruritus; vomiting, depression and lethargy; lethargy, anorexia</p><p>and hepatitis; gingival hyperplasia, lethargy, polyuria/polydipsia and soft stool; seizure;</p><p>sebaceous cyst; pruritus; erythema; or otitis externa.</p><p>Vomiting and diarrhea were the most common adverse reactions occurring during the</p><p>study. In most cases, signs spontaneously resolved with continued dosing. In other</p><p>cases, temporary dose modifications (brief interruption in dosing, divided dosing, or</p><p>administration with a small amount of food) were employed to resolve signs.</p><p>Persistent otitis externa, urinary tract infections, anorexia, gingival hyperplasia,</p><p>lymphadenopathy and lethargy were the next most frequent adverse events observed.</p><p>Gingival hyperplasia regressed with dose tapering. Owners of four dogs reported</p><p>seizures while dogs were receiving Atopica. In one dog, seizures were the result of a</p><p>brain tumor diagnosed one month into the study. Another dog experienced seizures</p><p>before and after the study.</p><p>Otitis externa, allergic otitis, or pinna erythema, with or without exudates, commonly</p><p>accompanies atopy. Many dogs entered the study with otitis externa, which did not</p><p>resolve without otic treatment. New cases of otitis externa, allergic otitis, or pinna</p><p>erythema developed while dogs were receiving Atopica. However, the incidence rate</p><p>was lower with Atopica compared to placebo. A change in the dose frequency was</p><p>not necessary when new cases occurred.</p><p><span class="Bold">Number of Dogs Displaying Each Clinical Observation in the Field Study</span></p><p></p><p>The following clinical signs were reported in less than 2% of dogs treated with Atopica</p><p>in the field study: constipation, flatulence, Clostridial organisms in the feces, nausea,</p><p>regurgitation, polyuria/polydipsia, strong urine odor, proteinuria, pruritus, erythema/flushed</p><p>appearance, pyoderma, sebaceous adenitis, crusty dermatitis, excessive shedding,</p><p>coarse coat, alopecia, papillomas, histiocytoma, granulomatous mass or lesion,</p><p>cutaneous cyst, epulis, benign epithelial tumor, multiple hemangioma, raised nodule on</p><p>pinna, seizure, shaking/trembling, hind limb twitch, panting, depression, irritability,</p><p>hyperactivity, quieter, increased light sensitivity, reluctance to go outside, weight loss,</p><p>hepatitis.</p><p>The following clinical signs were observed in 1.5-4.5% of dogs while receiving the</p><p>placebo: vomiting, diarrhea and urinary tract infection. The following clinical signs were</p><p>observed in less than 1% of dogs receiving the placebo: anorexia, otitis externa, cutaneous</p><p>cysts, corneal opacity, lymphadenopathy, erythema/flushed appearance.</p><p>Clinical Pathology Changes: During the study, some dogs experienced changes in</p><p>clinical chemistry parameters while receiving Atopica, as described in the following</p><p>table:</p><p></p><p>In addition, the following changes in clinical chemistry parameters were noted in less</p><p>than 2% of dogs: hypernatremia; hyperkalemia, elevated ALT, elevated ALP, hypercalcemia</p><p>and hyperchloremia. These clinical pathology changes were generally not associated</p><p>with clinical signs.</p><p>Post-approval Experience:</p><p>Neoplasms have been reported in dogs taking Atopica, including reports of lymphosarcoma</p><p>and mast cell tumor. It is unknown if these were preexisting or developed <span class="Italics">de novo</span> </p><p>while on Atopica.</p><p>In post-approval drug experience reporting, the following additional adverse reactions have</p><p>been associated with Atopica administration in dogs: vomiting, diarrhea, depression/</p><p>lethargy, anorexia, pruritus, liver enzyme elevations, trembling, convulsions, polydipsia,</p><p>polyuria, weight loss, hyperactivity, nervousness, neoplasia.</p><p>To report suspected adverse reactions or for technical assistance, call 1-800-332-2761.</p><h2>Clinical Pharmacology:</h2><p class="First">Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent that has been shown to work via</p><p>suppression of T-helper and T-suppressor cells and inhibition of interleukin-2. It does</p><p>not impair the hematopoietic system or cell-mediated immunologic responses. A</p><p>decrease in CD4 and CD8 cells was not seen in dogs receiving 20 mg/kg/day of</p><p>cyclosporine for 56 days. Atopica is not a corticosteroid or an antihistamine.</p><h3>Metabolism:</h3><p class="First">Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system in</p><p>the liver, and to a lesser degree in the gastrointestinal tract and the kidney. The</p><p>metabolism of cyclosporine can be altered by the co-administration of a variety of</p><p>agents (See <span class="Italics">Precautions</span>).</p><h3>Animal Safety:</h3><p class="First">In a 52-week oral study with dose levels of 0, 1, 3, and 9 times the target initial daily</p><p>dose, emesis, diarrhea and weight loss were seen in all cyclosporine treated groups</p><p>with increasing frequency as the dose increased.</p><p>Multilocular papilloma-like lesions of the skin were observed in 5 out of 8 high dose</p><p>animals between weeks 20 and 40. These changes regressed spontaneously after</p><p>drug was withdrawn.</p><p>Other findings in the mid and high dose animals included swollen gums due to chronic</p><p>gingivitis and periodontitis, lower serum albumin and higher cholesterol, triglyceride,</p><p>IgA and IgG. Hematological findings consisted of anemia and decreased leukocyte</p><p>counts in a few high dose animals. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates were increased at</p><p>all dose levels in a dose dependent fashion. Notable histopathological findings were</p><p>limited to lymphoid atrophy, hypertrophic gums (from gingivitis) and slight regenerative</p><p>changes of the renal tubular epithelium in high dose animals. The findings were shown</p><p>to be reversible during a 12-week recovery phase of the study.</p><p>In a 90-day study with Atopica, dogs were dosed in one of two patterns: either 1, 3,</p><p>or 5X the maximum recommended target initial daily dose for 90 days, or 1, 3, or 5X</p><p>the maximum recommended target initial daily dose for 30 days followed by tapering to</p><p>mimic the recommended clinical dosing pattern. The maximum recommended dose,</p><p>when administered for 90 days causes callus-like lesions on the footpads, red/swollen</p><p>pinnae, mild to moderate gingival proliferation, hyperkeratotic areas on the integument,</p><p>hair loss, salivation, vomiting, and diarrhea/abnormal stools. These clinical signs lessened</p><p>in severity or resolved as the drug was tapered to a lower dose. Increased erythrocyte</p><p>sedimentation rate, hyperproteinemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia,</p><p>hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia were observed at three and five times the</p><p>maximum recommended dose. These resolved as the dose was tapered.</p><p>When administered at higher than the maximum recommended dose, raised skin</p><p>lesions, papilloma-like areas on the integument, popliteal lymph node enlargement,</p><p>and weight loss were also seen. There were no Atopica related changes in urinalysis,</p><p>ECG, blood pressure, or ophthalmologic exams.</p><p>Gross necropsy revealed epithelial changes consistent with those seen on physical</p><p>examination. Proliferation of gingiva and toe pad epithelium was seen in all Atopica</p><p>dosed groups, and was seen in a dose dependent fashion. The degree of the proliferation</p><p>was greater in dogs in the non-tapered groups as compared to the tapered groups.</p><p>Similar changes were noted on histopathologic examination of the cutaneous changes</p><p>seen on physical examination. These lesions were characterized by epidermal hyperplasia,</p><p>chronic dermatitis and hyperkeratosis.</p><p>Methylprednisolone combination: Twenty-four dogs were administered 1 mg/kg/day</p><p>methylprednisolone alone for 14 days followed by 20 mg/kg/day cyclosporine either</p><p>alone or in combination with methylprednisolone, or placebo for 14 days. There was no</p><p>evidence of seizures/convulsions or neurological signs.</p><p>Vaccination effect: The effect of Atopica administration on the immunological</p><p>response to vaccination was evaluated in a study in which 16 dogs were dosed with</p><p>either Atopica at 20 mg/kg/day (4X the initial daily dose) or placebo for 56 days. All</p><p>dogs were vaccinated on Day 27 with a killed commercial rabies virus and a multivalent</p><p>vaccine (DHLPP) which included a modified live virus. Antibody titers for rabies, canine</p><p>distemper, canine adenovirus type 2, parainfluenza, parvovirus, <span class="Italics">Leptospira canicola</span>,</p><p>and <span class="Italics">Leptospira icterohaemmorrhagiae</span> were examined on Days 0, 27 (prior to vaccination),</p><p>42 and 56. Quantification of CD4, CD8, and CD3 T-lymphocytes was analyzed.</p><p>Clinical changes included soft stool and dermatologic changes consistent with those</p><p>seen in previous studies. Antibody titers did not rise in dogs treated with Atopica or</p><p>the placebo for any component of the multivalent vaccine which included a modified</p><p>live virus while all animals demonstrated a significant increase in antibody rabies titer by</p><p>Day 42 or 15 days post-revaccination. No effect was seen on T-lymphocytes.</p><h2>Storage Conditions:</h2><p class="First">Atopica should be stored and dispensed in the original unit-dose container at</p><p>controlled room temperature between 59 and 77Â°F (15-25Â°C).</p><h2>How Supplied:</h2><p class="First">Atopica soft gelatin capsules (cyclosporine capsules, USP) MODIFIED are supplied in</p><p>packages of 15 unit-dose blisters as follows:</p><p>10 mg: oval, white capsules imprinted with red âNVR 10â.</p><p>25 mg: oval, blue-gray capsules imprinted with red âNVR 25mgâ.</p><p>50 mg: oval, white capsules imprinted with red âNVR 50mgâ.</p><p>100 mg: oval, blue-gray capsules imprinted with red âNVR 100mgâ.</p><p>Manufactured for: Novartis Animal Health US, Inc.
