</ul><h2>Description</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DESCRIPTION:</span> Each mL contains: gentamicin sulfate equivalent to 0.57 mg<br/>
gentamicin base, betamethasone valerate equivalent to 0.284 mg betamethasone,<br/>
163 mg isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, methylparaben and propylparaben as<br/>
preservatives, purified water q.s. Hydrochloric acid may be added to adjust pH.<br/></p><h2>Chemistry, Pharmacology and Toxicity</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">CHEMISTRY:</span> Gentamicin is a mixture of aminoglycoside antibiotics derived from the<br/>
fermentation of <span class="Italics">Micromonospora purpurea</span>. Gentamicin sulfate is a mixture of sulfate<br/>
salts of the antibiotics produced in this fermentation. The salts are weakly acidic<br/>
and freely soluble in water.</p><p>Gentamicin sulfate contains not less than 500 micrograms of gentamicin base per<br/>
milligram.</p><p>Betamethasone valerate is a synthetic glucocorticoid.</p><p><span class="Bold">PHARMACOLOGY:</span> Gentamicin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is a highly<br/>
effective topical treatment for bacterial infection of the skin <span class="Italics">In vitro</span>,<br/>
gentamicin is bactericidal against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-<br/>
negative bacteria isolated from domestic animals. <span class="Sup">1,2</span> Specifically, gentamicin is<br/>
active against the following organisms isolated from canine skin: <span class="Italics">Alcaligenes</span><br/>
sp., <span class="Italics">Citrobacter sp</span>., <span class="Italics">Klebsiella sp</span>., <span class="Italics">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, indole-positive<br/>
and -negative <span class="Italics">Proteus sp</span>., <span class="Italics">Escherichia coli</span>, <span class="Italics">Enterobacter sp</span>.,  <span class="Italics">Staphlyococcus sp</span>.<br/>
and <span class="Italics">Streptococcus sp</span>.</p><p>Betamethasone valerate emerged from intensive research as the most<br/>
promising of some 50 newly synthesized corticosteroids in the<br/>
experimental model described by McKenzie,<span class="Sup">3</span> et al. This human bioassay<br/>
technique has been found reliable for evaluating vasoconstrictor<br/>
properties of new topical corticosteroids and is useful in predicting clinical<br/>
efficacy.</p><p>Betamethasone valerate in veterinary medicine has been shown to provide<br/>
anti-inflammatory and antipruritic activity in the topical management of<br/>
corticosteroid-responsive infected superficial lesions in dogs.</p><p><span class="Bold">TOXICITY:</span> Gentamicin sulfate with betamethasone valerate topical spray<br/>
was well-tolerated in an abraded skin study in dogs. No treatment-related<br/>
toxicological changes in the skin were observed.</p><p>Systemic effects directly related to treatment were confined to histological<br/>
changes in the adrenals, liver and kidney and to organ-to-body<br/>
weight ratios of adrenals. All were dose related, were typical for or not<br/>
unexpected with corticosteroid therapy and were considered reversible<br/>
with cessation of treatment.<br/></p><h2>Warning</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">WARNING:</span> Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that<br/>
corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to animals may induce the<br/>
first stage of parturition when administered during the last trimester of<br/>
pregnancy and may precipitate premature parturition followed by dystocia,<br/>
fetal death, retained placenta and metritis.</p><p>Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits and rodents<br/>
during pregnancy have produced cleft palate. Other congenital anomalies,<br/>
including deformed forelegs, phocomelia and anasarca, have been<br/>
reported in offspring of dogs which received corticosteroids during<br/>
pregnancy.<br/></p><h2>Indications and contraindications</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">INDICATIONS:</span> For the treatment of infected superficial lesions in dogs<br/>
caused by bacteria susceptible to gentamicin.</p><p><span class="Bold">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</span> If hypersensitivity of any of the components<br/>
occurs, discontinue treatment and institute appropriate therapy.<br/></p><h2>Dosage and Administration:</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:</span> Prior to treatment, remove excessive<br/>
hair and clean the lesion and adjacent area. Hold bottle upright 3 to 6<br/>
inches from the lesion and depress the sprayer head twice. Administer 2<br/>
to 4 times daily for 7 days.</p><p>Each depression of the sprayer head delivers 0.7 mL of Gentamicin<br/>
Sulfate With Betamethasone Valerate Topical Spray.<br/></p><h2>Side Effects and Precautions</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">SIDE EFFECTS:</span> Side effects such as SAP and SGPT enzyme<br/>
elevations, weight loss, anorexia, polydipsia and polyuria have occurred<br/>
following parenteral or systemic use of synthetic corticosteroids in dogs.<br/>
Vomiting and diarrhea (occasionally bloody) have been observed in dogs.</p><p>Cushing's syndrome in dogs has been reported in association with<br/>
prolonged or repeated steroid therapy.</p><p><span class="Bold">PRECAUTIONS:</span> Antibiotic susceptibility of the pathogenic organism(s)<br/>
should be determined prior to use of this preparation. Use of topical<br/>
antibiotics may permit overgrowth of non-susceptible bacteria, fungi or<br/>
yeasts. If this occurs, treatment should be instituted with other<br/>
appropriate agents as indicated.</p><p>Administration of recommended dose beyond 7 days may result in<br/>
delayed wound healing. Animals treated longer than 7 days should be<br/>
monitored closely.</p><p>Avoid ingestion. Oral or parenteral use of corticosteroids, depending on<br/>
dose, duration and specific steroid may result in inhibition of endogenous<br/>
steroid production following drug withdrawal.</p><p>In patients presently receiving or recently withdrawn from systemic<br/>
corticosteroids treatments, therapy with a rapidly acting corticosteroid<br/>
should be considered in especially stressful situations.</p><p>If ingestion should occur, patients should be closely observed for the<br/>
usual signs of adrenocorticoid overdosage, which includes sodium<br/>
retention, potassium loss, fluid retention, weight gains, polydipsia and/or<br/>
polyuria. Prolonged use or overdosage may produce adverse<br/>
immunosuppressive effects.<br/></p><h2>How Supplied and Storage</h2><p class="First"><span class="Bold">HOW SUPPLIED:</span> Plastic spray bottles containing 60 mL, 120 mL and<br/>
