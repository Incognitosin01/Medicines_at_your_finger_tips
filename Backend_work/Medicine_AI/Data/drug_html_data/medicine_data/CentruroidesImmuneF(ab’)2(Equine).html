Initial: 3 vials (containing ≤57 mg total protein and ≥450 LD50 [mouse] neutralizing units); may administer additional vials in 1-vial increments every 30 to 60 minutes as needed. Typical dosage range: 1 to 5 vials (Boyer 2013).</p><h2>Dosing: Pediatric</h2><p><b>Scorpion envenomation:</b> Infants, Children, and Adolescents: IV: Initial: 3 vials (containing ≤57 mg total protein and ≥450 LD50 [mouse] neutralizing units) initiated as soon as possible after scorpion sting in patients who develop clinically important signs of envenomation; may administer additional vials in 1-vial increments every 30 to 60 minutes as needed; typical reported dosage range: 1 to 5 vials (Boyer 2013).</p><h2>Reconstitution</h2><p>Reconstitute each vial with 5 mL NS; gently swirl to mix.  Dilute dose (eg, 1-3 vials) with NS to a total volume of 50 mL. Inspect diluted solution; do not use if it contains particulate matter or is discolored or turbid. </p><h2>Administration</h2><p>IV: Administer over 10 minutes; monitor for return of symptoms of envenomation and repeat as needed. Medications (eg, epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine) and equipment for resuscitation should be readily available in case of hypersensitivity reactions. Avoid IM since the time to peak blood concentration may be prolonged with this route of administration (Turri 2011; Vasquez 2010).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="storage">Storage</h2><p>Store unused vials at room temperature of 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted up to 40°C (104°F); do not freeze. Discard partially used vials.</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="interactions">Drug Interactions</h2><p>There are no known significant interactions.</p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p>The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.</p><p>1% to 10%:</p><p>Central nervous system: Fatigue (2%), headache (2%), lethargy (1%) </p><p>Dermatologic: Skin rash (3%), pruritus (2%) </p><p>Gastrointestinal: Vomiting (5%), nausea (2%), diarrhea (1%)</p><p>Miscellaneous: Fever (4%)</p><p>Neuromuscular &amp; skeletal: Myalgia (2%)</p><p>Respiratory: Rhinorrhea (2%), cough (1%)</p><p>&lt;1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Aspiration, ataxia, chest tightness, hypersensitivity, hypoxia, ocular edema, palpitations, pneumonia, respiratory distress, serum sickness (delayed) </p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="warnings">Warnings/Precautions</h2><p><b><i>Concern related to adverse effects:</i></b></p><p>• Acute hypersensitivity reactions: Derived from equine (horse) immune globulin F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> fragments; anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions are possible, especially in patients with known allergies to horse protein. However, due to the lower protein content, purity, and absence of the immunogenic Fc portion of the immunoglobulin, serious adverse events are uncommon; in a prospective study (n=1,534), the incidence of acute antivenom reactions and type 3 immune reactions was 0.2% (n=3) and 0.5% (n=8), respectively (Boyer 2013). Patients who have had previous treatment with <i>Centruroides</i> immune F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> or other equine-derived antivenom/antitoxin may be at a higher risk for hypersensitivity reactions. In patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction, discontinue the infusion and administer emergency care. Immediate treatment (eg, epinephrine 1 mg/mL, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine) should be available.</p><p>• Delayed serum sickness: Delayed serum sickness may occur, usually within 2 weeks; monitor patients with follow-up visits for signs and symptoms (eg, arthralgia, fever, myalgia, rash).</p><p><b><i>Dosage form related issues:</i></b></p><p>• Cresol: Product may contain small amounts of cresol resulting from the manufacturing process; local reactions and myalgias may occur.</p><p>• Disease transmission: Product of equine (horse) plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents (eg, viruses) which could transmit disease.</p><h2>Monitoring Parameters</h2><p>Signs and symptoms of envenomation (eg, opsoclonus, involuntary muscle movement, slurred speech, paresthesias, respiratory distress, salivation, frothy sputum, vomiting). Monitor for signs and symptoms of acute antivenom hypersensitivity reactions (eg, urticaria, dyspnea); follow-up visits for signs and symptoms of serum sickness (eg, arthralgia, fever, myalgia, rash).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="pregnancy">Pregnancy Risk Factor
C

Pregnancy Considerations</h2><p>Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. In general, medications used as antidotes should take into consideration the health and prognosis of the mother; antidotes should be administered to pregnant women if there is a clear indication for use and should not be withheld because of fears of teratogenicity (Bailey 2003). Pregnant women experiencing symptoms refractory to reasonable doses of opioids or other systemic effects which pose a danger to the patient or fetus should be considered for antivenom therapy (Brown 2013).</p><h2 class="ddc-anchor-offset" id="patient-education">Patient Education</h2><p><b>What is this drug used for?</b></p><p>• It is used to treat scorpion stings.</p><p><b>All drugs may cause side effects.
