</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Ebanga</h2><p class="First">Ebanga is indicated for the treatment of infection caused by <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><p>The efficacy of Ebanga has not been established for other species of the <span class="Italics">Ebolavirus</span> and <span class="Italics">Marburgvirus</span> genera.</p><p><span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> can change over time, and factors such as emergence of resistance, or changes in viral virulence could diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Consider available information on drug susceptibility patterns for circulating <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> strains when deciding whether to use Ebanga.</p><h2>Ebanga Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Recommended Dosage for Adult and Pediatric Patients</h3><p class="First">The recommended dosage of Ebanga is 50 mg/kg administered as a single intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes. Ebanga must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP then further diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP prior to IV infusion <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]</span>.</p><h3>. Preparation, Administration, and Storage Instructions</h3><p class="First">Ebanga must be prepared and administered under the supervision of a health care professional.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Reconstitution Instructions</span></p><ul>
<li>Aseptically reconstitute and further dilute Ebanga prior to IV infusion. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus.</li>
<li>More than one vial may be needed for a full dose. Calculate the dose (mg) based on the patient's actual weight in kg and the number of Ebanga vials required <span class="Italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]</span>.</li>
<li>Prior to reconstitution, allow Ebanga vial(s) to reach ambient temperature (15°C to 27°C [59°F to 81°F]) for approximately 20 minutes. If for any reason reconstitution cannot proceed immediately upon reaching ambient temperature, vials that have NOT been reconstituted may be kept at ambient temperature, protected from light, for no more than 24 hours.</li>
<li>Immediately upon reaching ambient temperature, use a sterile 10 mL syringe and an 18-gauge needle to withdraw 7.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Insert the needle tip into the Ebanga vial. Holding horizontally, angle the needle down at an approximate 45° angle, above the lyophilized powder, which has a cake-like appearance. Slowly inject the diluent along the wall of the vial and without any air to avoid foaming and bubbles.</li>
<li>Gently swirl (do NOT shake) for approximately 10 seconds; then set the vial down to rest for at least 10 seconds. Repeat until the cake is dissolved. This may take up to 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Upon reconstitution, one vial delivers 8 mL of solution that is clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow containing 50 mg/mL of ansuvimab-zykl. Do NOT administer and discard the vial if the reconstituted solution is discolored or contains visible particles.</li>
<li>Reconstituted solution in the vials may be kept at ambient temperature (15°C to 27°C [59°F to 81°F]) or stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F), protected from light, for <span class="Italics">up to four (4) hours</span>. This 4-hour window includes time required for further dilution and Ebanga solution should be infused immediately upon further dilution.</li>
</ul><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Dilution Instructions</span></p><ul>
<li>Following reconstitution, Ebanga must be further diluted prior to IV infusion.
<ul class="Circle">
<li>Use an 18-20 gauge, 1-1.5" needle with an appropriately sized syringe up to 60 mL to perform the dilution steps.</li>
<li>Prepare the Ebanga IV dosing solution using an appropriately sized syringe up to 60 mL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For patients weighing &gt; 2 kg, prepare the diluent using either a PVC 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP IV infusion bag or a non-PVC or non-DEHP Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP IV infusion bag. For patients weighing 0.5 to &lt; 2 kg use a pump-compatible syringe (Table 1).
<ul class="Circle">
<li>For adult and pediatric patients, either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP can be used as the diluent.</li>

</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">For injection: 400 mg of ansuvimab-zykl, available as an off-white to white lyophilized powder in single-dose vial for reconstitution and further dilution.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None<span class="Italics">.</span></p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Infusion-Associated Events</h3><p class="First">Hypersensitivity reactions including infusion-associated events have been reported with Ebanga. These may include acute, life-threatening reactions during and after the infusion. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms including, but not limited to, hypotension, chills and elevation of fever, during and following Ebanga infusion. In the case of severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, discontinue the administration of Ebanga immediately and administer appropriate emergency care <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p>Infusion could not be completed in 1% of subjects who received Ebanga due to infusion-associated adverse events. The rate of infusion of Ebanga may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops any signs of infusion-associated events or other adverse events <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul>
<li>Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Infusion-Associated Events <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>Overall, 424 adult and pediatric subjects with <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection received Ebanga in one clinical trial and as part of an expanded access program during the 2018 <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</p><p>In the PALM trial, the safety of Ebanga was evaluated in a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, in which 173 subjects (119 adults and 54 pediatric subjects) with confirmed <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection received Ebanga as a single 50 mg/kg IV infusion and 168 subjects received an investigational control <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>. All subjects received optimized standard of care treatment (oSOC). The median age of the study population that received Ebanga was 26 years (range: 1 day to 85 years). Fifty-five percent (55%) of enrolled subjects were female and 45% were male.</p><p>During the same outbreak, 251 subjects (173 adults and 78 pediatric subjects) with laboratory-confirmed <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection received Ebanga under an expanded access program; 57% of whom were female and 43% of whom were male. Ages ranged from 6 days to 80 years, with a median age of 25 years.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Common Adverse Events</span></p><p>Table 2 summarizes the adverse events that were reported in the PALM trial from a pre-defined list of signs and symptoms that occurred during Ebanga infusion. The evaluation of adverse events in subjects who received Ebanga may have been confounded by the signs and symptoms of the underlying <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection. Twenty nine percent (n=51) of subjects who received Ebanga in the PALM Trial experienced a pre-specified infusion-related adverse event. The most common pre-specified infusion-related adverse event reported in at least 10% of subjects who received Ebanga was fever (Table 2). The adverse event profile in adult and pediatric subjects treated with Ebanga was similar.</p><p>The following pre-specified symptoms, which were assessed on a daily basis during admission while admitted to the treatment unit, were reported in ≥40% of subjects who received Ebanga: diarrhea, pyrexia, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Evaluation of these symptoms may have been confounded by the underlying <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Discontinuation and Infusion Rate Adjustments</span></p><p>Approximately 99% of subjects who received Ebanga in the PALM trial were able to complete their dose within one hour. Two subjects who received Ebanga (1%) did not receive their complete infusion. In eight subjects (5%) the Ebanga infusion rate was decreased due to an AE <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span>.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Selected Laboratory Abnormalities in the PALM Trial</span></p><p>Table 3 presents selected laboratory abnormalities (worsening to Grade 3 or 4 compared to baseline) in the PALM trial.</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity from using ansuvimab-zykl. There are no data to assess the effects of potential immunogenicity on efficacy and safety in subjects with <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection.</p><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><h3>Vaccine Interactions</h3><p class="First">No vaccine-therapeutic interaction studies have been performed in human subjects using Ebanga. However, because of the potential for Ebanga to inhibit replication of a live vaccine virus indicated for prevention of <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection and possibly reduce the efficacy of the vaccine, avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine during treatment with Ebanga. The interval between administration of Ebanga therapy and live vaccination should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines. The efficacy of Ebanga among subjects who reported receipt of a recombinant live vaccine prior to their enrollment in the PALM trial was similar to subjects who did not report receiving a vaccine prior to enrollment.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection is life-threatening for both the mother and fetus and treatment should not be withheld due to pregnancy <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. Available data from the PALM trial in which pregnant women with <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection were treated with Ebanga demonstrate the high rate of maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity consistent with published literature regarding the risk associated with underlying maternal <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection. These data are insufficient to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal/fetal outcome.</p><p>Animal reproduction studies with ansuvimab-zykl have not been conducted. Monoclonal antibodies, such as Ebanga, are transported across the placenta; therefore, Ebanga has the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing fetus.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p class="First"><span class="Italics">Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk</span></p><p>Maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes are poor among pregnant women infected with <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span>. The majority of such pregnancies result in maternal death with miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Treatment should not be withheld due to pregnancy.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that mothers with confirmed <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> not breastfeed their infants to reduce the risk of postnatal transmission of <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection.</p><p>There are no data on the presence of ansuvimab-zykl in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to ansuvimab-zykl are unknown.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Ebanga for the treatment of infection caused by <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> have been established in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age. Use of Ebanga for this indication is supported by evidence from a multi-center, open label, randomized controlled trial of Ebanga in adults and pediatric subjects that included 54 pediatric subjects birth to less than 18 years of age, including neonates born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection. Of the total number of subjects administered Ebanga in the PALM trial, pediatric subjects (1 day to 17 years) accounted for 31% (n=54) of the study population in the PALM trial. The 28-day mortality and safety in adult and pediatric subjects treated with Ebanga were similar <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Studies (14)].</span> An additional 78 (31%) pediatric subjects from birth to less than 18 years of age received Ebanga in an expanded access program.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical trials of Ebanga did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether the safety profile of Ebanga is different in this population compared to younger subjects. Of the total number of subjects administered Ebanga in the PALM trial, 6 subjects (3%) were 65 years or older. The limited clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects.</p><h2>Ebanga Description</h2><p class="First">Ansuvimab-zykl is a <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> (EBOV) glycoprotein 1 (GP1)-directed recombinant, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Ansuvimab-zykl is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology and has an approximate molecular weight of 147 kDa.</p><p>Ebanga (ansuvimab-zykl) for injection is a sterile, preservative-free, off-white to white lyophilized powder in a single-dose vial for IV use after reconstitution and dilution. Each single-dose vial delivers 400 mg of ansuvimab-zykl, and L-histidine (12.4 mg), L-histidine HCl (16.8 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.6 mg), and sucrose (657 mg). After reconstitution with 7.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, each vial delivers 8 mL of a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution containing 50 mg/mL of ansuvimab-zykl, with an approximate pH of 6.</p><h2>Ebanga - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Ansuvimab-zykl is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody with antiviral activity against <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus [see Microbiology (12.4)</span>].</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First">Ansuvimab-zykl exposure-response relationship and the time course of pharmacodynamic response is unknown.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">Limited data from 18 healthy subjects 22 to 56 years of age suggests that the pharmacokinetic profile of ansuvimab-zykl is consistent with the profile of other IgG1 monoclonal antibodies.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic data are not available for <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infected patients.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Specific Populations</span></p><p>The effect of age, renal impairment or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ansuvimab-zykl is unknown.</p><h3>Microbiology</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Mechanism of Action</span></p><p>Ebanga (ansuvimab-zykl) is a recombinant, human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycan cap and inner chalice of the EBOV GP1 subunit. The epitope to which it binds is located within the receptor binding domain of EBOV consisting of amino acids LEIKKPDGS (GP residues 111–119).</p><p>Ansuvimab-zykl binds EBOV GP without the mucin domain with a K<span class="Sub">D</span> of 0.2 nM at pH 7.4 and 0.6 nM at pH 5.3 as measured by biolayer interferometry. Ansuvimab-zykl blocks binding of EBOV GP1 to the Neiman Pick cell receptor 1 in host cells (IC<span class="Sub">50</span> value of 0.09 μg/mL), inhibiting virus entry into the host cell. Ansuvimab-zykl exhibited Fc-mediated Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity against cells expressing EBOV GP when effector cells were added.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Antiviral Activity</span></p><p>In a live virus plaque-reduction neutralization assay performed in Vero E6 cells, ansuvimab-zykl neutralized <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> Mayinga with an EC<span class="Sub">50</span> value of 0.06 µg/mL.

The ADCC activity of ansuvimab-zykl was assessed in EBOV GP-transduced and non-transduced HEK293T target cells in the presence of antibody with effector cells added at an effector-to-target cell ratio 1:50 and analyzed via flow cytometry. Ansuvimab-zykl mediated ADCC, with maximal activity observed at a mAb concentration of 0.03 μg/mL. Treatment of <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infected rhesus macaques with a single IV dose of ansuvimab-zykl (50 mg per kg) generally protected infected animals from <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> mediated death when drug was administered 5 days post-infection.</p><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Resistance</span></p><p>No nonclinical or clinical studies evaluating resistance to ansuvimab-zykl have been conducted.

The trial was conducted in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where an outbreak began in August 2018, and enrolled 681 subjects of all ages, including pregnant women, with documented <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> infection and symptoms of any duration who were receiving oSOC. Subjects were randomized to receive Ebanga 50 mg/kg IV as a single infusion, an investigational control 50 mg/kg IV every third day, for a total of 3 doses, or other investigational drugs. Eligible subjects had a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> and had not received other investigational treatments (with the exception of experimental vaccines) within the previous 30 days. Neonates ≤7 days of age were eligible if the mother had documented infection. Neonates born to a mother who had cleared <span class="Italics">Zaire ebolavirus</span> following a course of her assigned investigational medication were also eligible to be enrolled at investigator discretion regarding the likelihood that the neonate was infected. Randomization was stratified by reverse transcription-PCR cycle threshold calculated using NP targets (CtNP ≤22.0 vs &gt;22.0; corresponding to high and low viral load, respectively) and Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) site.
