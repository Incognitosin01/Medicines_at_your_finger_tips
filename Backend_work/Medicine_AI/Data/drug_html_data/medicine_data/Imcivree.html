</ul><h2>Indications and Usage for Imcivree</h2><p class="First">Imcivree is indicated for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with obesity due to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency confirmed by genetic testing demonstrating variants in <span class="Italics">POMC</span>, <span class="Italics">PCSK1</span>, or <span class="Italics">LEPR</span> genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS).</p><p><span class="Bold">Limitations of Use:</span></p><p>Imcivree is not indicated for the treatment of patients with the following conditions as<br/>
Imcivree would not be expected to be effective:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Obesity due to suspected POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency with <span class="Italics">POMC</span>, <span class="Italics">PCSK1</span>, or <span class="Italics">LEPR</span> variants classified as benign or likely benign</li>
<li>Other types of obesity not related to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency, including obesity associated with other genetic syndromes and general (polygenic) obesity</li>
</ul><h2>Imcivree Dosage and Administration</h2><h3>Patient Selection</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Select patients for treatment with Imcivree who have genetically confirmed or suspected deficiency of POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></li>
<li>Treat patients with variants in <span class="Italics">POMC</span>, <span class="Italics">PCSK1</span>, or <span class="Italics">LEPR</span> genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS) in the clinical context of the patient <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></li>
<li>Currently available tests for the detection of variants in the POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes have not been approved or cleared by the FDA.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosage in Adults and Pediatric Patients 12 Years of Age and Older</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>The starting dose of Imcivree is 2 mg (0.2 mL) injected subcutaneously once daily for 2 weeks. Monitor patients for gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></li>
<li>If the starting dose is not tolerated, reduce to 1 mg (0.1 mL) once daily. If the 1 mg once daily dose is tolerated and additional weight loss is desired, titrate to 2 mg (0.2 mL) once daily.</li>
<li>If the 2 mg daily dose is tolerated and additional weight loss is desired, increase the dose to 3 mg (0.3 mL) once daily. If the 3 mg once daily dose is not tolerated, maintain administration of 2 mg (0.2 mL) once daily.</li>
</ul><h3>Dosage in Pediatric Patients 6 to less than 12 Years of Age</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>For pediatric patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the starting dose of Imcivree is 1 mg (0.1 mL) injected subcutaneously once daily for 2 weeks. Monitor patients for GI adverse reactions <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></li>
<li>If the starting dose is not tolerated, reduce to 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) once daily. If the 0.5 mg once daily dose is tolerated and additional weight loss is desired, the dose may be increased to 1 mg (0.1 mL) once daily.</li>
<li>If the 1 mg dose is tolerated, increase the dose to 2 mg (0.2 mL) once daily.</li>
<li>If the 2 mg once daily dose is not tolerated, reduce to 1 mg (0.1 mL) once daily. If the 2 mg once daily dose is tolerated and additional weight loss is desired, the dose may be increased to 3 mg (0.3 mL) once daily.</li>
</ul><h3>Monitoring</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Periodically assess response to Imcivree therapy. In pediatric patients, evaluate the impact of weight loss on growth and maturation.</li>
<li>Evaluate weight loss after 12-16 weeks of treatment. If a patient has not lost at least 5% of baseline body weight or 5% of baseline BMI for patients with continued growth potential, discontinue Imcivree as it is unlikely that the patient will achieve and sustain clinically meaningful weight loss with continued treatment.</li>
</ul><h3>Administration Instructions</h3><ul class="Disc">
<li>Prior to initiation of Imcivree, train patients on proper injection technique. Instruct patients to use a 1-mL syringe with a 28- or 29-gauge needle appropriate for subcutaneous injection.</li>
<li>Inspect Imcivree visually before use. It should appear clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is seen.</li>
<li>Remove Imcivree from the refrigerator approximately 15 minutes prior to administration. Alternatively, warm Imcivree prior to administration by rolling the vial gently between the palms of the hands for 60 seconds.</li>
<li>Administer Imcivree once daily, at the beginning of the day, without regard to meals.</li>
<li>Inject Imcivree subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or arm, rotating to a different site each day. Do not administer Imcivree intravenously or intramuscularly.</li>
<li>If a dose is missed, resume the once daily regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose.</li>
</ul><h2>Dosage Forms and Strengths</h2><p class="First">Injection: 10 mg/mL, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution in a 1-mL multiple-dose vial.</p><h2>Contraindications</h2><p class="First">None</p><h2>Warnings and Precautions</h2><h3>Disturbance in Sexual Arousal</h3><p class="First">Sexual adverse reactions may occur in patients treated with Imcivree. Spontaneous penile erections in males (23%) and sexual adverse reactions in females (7% in Imcivree-treated patients and 0% in placebo-treated patients from an unapproved population) occurred in clinical studies with Imcivree <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p>Inform patients that these events may occur and instruct patients who have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours to seek emergency medical attention.</p><h3>Depression and Suicidal Ideation</h3><p class="First">Some drugs that target the central nervous system, such as Imcivree, may cause depression or suicidal ideation. Patients with a history of severe depression were excluded from Imcivree clinical studies. Depression (26%) and suicidal ideation (11%) occurred in Imcivree clinical studies <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</span></p><p>Monitor patients for new onset or worsening of depression. Consider discontinuing Imcivree if patients experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors.</p><h3>Skin Pigmentation and Darkening of Pre-Existing Nevi</h3><p class="First">Imcivree may cause generalized increased skin pigmentation and darkening of pre-existing nevi due to its pharmacologic effect. Skin hyperpigmentation occurred in 21 patients (78%) of patients treated with Imcivree <span class="Italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].</span> This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.</p><p>Perform a full body skin examination prior to initiation and periodically during treatment with Imcivree to monitor pre-existing and new skin pigmentary lesions.</p><h3>Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative in Neonates and Low Birth Weight Infants</h3><p class="First">Imcivree is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including “gasping syndrome” can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs. The “gasping syndrome” is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (Imcivree contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) <span class="Italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><h2>Adverse Reactions</h2><p class="First">The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:</p><ul class="Disc">
<li>Spontaneous Penile Erection <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]</span></li>
<li>Depression and Suicidal Ideation <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</span></li>
<li>Skin Pigmentation and Darkening of Pre-Existing Nevi <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</span></li>
</ul><h3>Clinical Trials Experience</h3><p class="First">Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</p><p>The safety of Imcivree was evaluated in two 52-week, open-label clinical studies of 27 patients with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency with <span class="Italics">POMC</span>, <span class="Italics">PCSK1</span>, or <span class="Italics">LEPR</span> genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)].</span></p><p>Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in the open-label studies during the first 52 weeks of treatment in 3 or more patients treated with Imcivree.</p><p class="First Footnote"><span class="Sup">a</span> Includes injection site erythema, pruritus, edema, pain, induration, bruising, hypersensitivity, hematoma, nodule, and discoloration</p><p class="Footnote"><span class="Sup">b</span> Includes skin hyperpigmentation, pigmentation disorders, skin discoloration</p><p class="Footnote"><span class="Sup">c</span> Includes abdominal pain and upper abdominal pain</p><p class="Footnote"><span class="Sup">d</span> Includes depressed mood</p><p class="Footnote"><span class="Sup">e</span> n = 13 male patients</p><p>In a 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical study in an unapproved population, 4 female patients (7%) treated with Imcivree experienced sexual adverse reactions compared to 0 patients in the placebo group; 3 experienced a disturbance in sexual arousal and one experienced hypersensitivity of the labia.</p><h3>Immunogenicity</h3><p class="First">As with all peptides, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p><p>Approximately 61% of adult and pediatric patients with POMC- or LEPR-deficiency who received Imcivree (N=28) screened positive for antibodies to Imcivree, and 39% screened negative. The 61% of patients who screened positive for antibodies to Imcivree were inconclusive for antibodies to Imcivree in the confirmatory assay. There was no observation of a rapid decline in Imcivree concentrations to suggest the presence of anti-drug antibodies.</p><p>Approximately 13% of adult and pediatric patients with LEPR-deficiency (3 patients) confirmed positive for antibodies to alpha-MSH that were classified as low-titer and non-persistent. Of these 3 patients (13%), 2 tested positive post- Imcivree treatment and 1 was positive pre-treatment. None of the patients with POMC-deficiency were confirmed to have antibodies to alpha-MSH.</p><h2>USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h2><h3>Pregnancy</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Discontinue Imcivree when pregnancy is recognized unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.</p><p>Imcivree contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].</span></p><p>There are no available data with Imcivree in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. For the general US population, weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm <span class="Italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</span>. In animal reproduction studies, setmelanotide subcutaneously administered to pregnant rats from before mating to the end of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses 11 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 mg. Setmelanotide subcutaneously administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at clinical doses. Setmelanotide administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats during organogenesis through lactation did not result in adverse developmental effects at doses 7 times the MRHD (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>).</p><p>The estimated background risk of birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p><span class="Bold">Clinical Considerations</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risks</span></p><p>Maternal obesity increases the risk for congenital malformations, including neural tube defects, cardiac malformations, oral clefts, and limb reduction defects. In addition, weight loss during pregnancy may result in fetal harm including increased risk of small for gestational age. Appropriate weight gain based on pre-pregnancy weight is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p><span class="Italics">Animal Data</span></p><p>Embryo-fetal development was evaluated in female rats administered setmelanotide subcutaneously during mating to end of major organogenesis (14 days prior to mating to gestation day 17) at doses of 0.5, 3, and 5 mg/kg/day, resulting in exposures up to 11 times the human exposure at MRHD of 3 mg, based on AUC. Dose-related decreases in maternal food intake and body weight gain were observed during the premating period but not during gestation. No evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity was observed.</p><p>Embryo-fetal development was evaluated in pregnant rabbits subcutaneously administered setmelanotide during organogenesis (gestation days 7 to 19) at doses of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg/day, resulting in clinically relevant exposures at the MRHD, based on AUC. Decreases in maternal food consumption and body weight were observed at all doses. Increases in embryo-fetal resorptions and post-implantation losses were observed at ≥0.1 mg/kg/day in the presence of significant maternal toxicity, and fetal body weights were 7% lower than controls at 0.2 mg/kg/day.</p><p>Pre- and post-natal development was evaluated in rats subcutaneously administered setmelanotide during organogenesis and continuing to weaning (gestation day 6 to lactation day 21) at doses of 0.5, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/kg/day, which resulted in exposures up to 7 times the human exposure at the MRHD, based on AUC. Pup body weights at birth were 9% lower than controls at 3.0 and 5.0 mg/kg/day, which was consistent with reduced maternal body weight gain and food consumption during gestation. No adverse setmelanotide-related effects on pup survival, growth, maturation, visual function, neurobehavioral performance, or reproductive performance were observed up to the highest dose.</p><h3>Lactation</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Risk Summary</span></p><p>Treatment with Imcivree is not recommended for use while breastfeeding.</p><p>Imcivree from multiple-dose vials contains the preservative benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]</span>.</p><p>There is no information on the presence of setmelanotide or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, setmelanotide is present in the milk of rats (<span class="Italics">see Data</span>). When a drug is present in rat milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk.</p><p><span class="Bold">Data</span></p><p>Dose-related setmelanotide concentrations were observed in milk 2 hours after subcutaneous injection in the preweaning phase of a pre- and post-natal development study in rats. No quantifiable setmelanotide concentrations were detected in plasma from nursing pups on post-natal Day 11.</p><h3>Pediatric Use</h3><p class="First">The safety and effectiveness of Imcivree for obesity due to POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of Imcivree for this indication is supported by evidence from 2 open-label studies that included 9 pediatric patients <span class="Italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</span>.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of Imcivree have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years old.</p><p>Imcivree is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the “gasping syndrome” occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Preterm, low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (Imcivree contains 10 mg of benzyl alcohol) <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]</span>.</p><h3>Geriatric Use</h3><p class="First">Clinical studies of Imcivree did not include subjects aged 65 and over. It is not known whether they respond differently from younger subjects.</p><h3>Renal Impairment</h3><p class="First">Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests decreased clearance in patients with renal impairment. The majority of patients in the clinical studies had normal renal function.</p><p>No dose adjustments for patients with mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) are needed. Imcivree is not recommended for use in patients with moderate (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>) and end stage renal disease (eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m<span class="Sup">2</span>).</p><h2>Overdosage</h2><p class="First">In the event of an overdose initiate appropriate supportive treatment according to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms.</p><h2>Imcivree Description</h2><p class="First">Imcivree contains setmelanotide acetate, a melanocortin 4 (MC4) receptor agonist. Setmelanotide is an 8 amino acid cyclic peptide analog of endogenous melanocortin peptide α-MSH (alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone).</p><p>The chemical name for setmelanotide acetate is acetyl-L-arginyl-L-cysteinyl-D-alanyl-L-histidinyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-arginyl-L-tryptophanyl-L-cysteinamide cyclic (2→8)-disulfide acetate.

Each 1 mL of Imcivree contains 10 mg of setmelanotide provided as setmelanotide acetate, which is a salt with 2 to 4 molar equivalents of acetate, and the following inactive ingredients: 100 mg N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethylene glycol 2000)-1,2-distearoyl- glycero-3- phosphoethanolamine sodium salt, 8 mg carboxymethylcellulose sodium (average MWt 90,500), 11 mg mannitol, 5 mg phenol, 10 mg benzyl alcohol, 1 mg edetate disodium dihydrate, and Water for Injection. The pH of Imcivree is 5 to 6.</p><h2>Imcivree - Clinical Pharmacology</h2><h3>Mechanism of Action</h3><p class="First">Setmelanotide is an MC4 receptor agonist with 20-fold less activity at the melanocortin 3 (MC3) and melanocortin 1 (MC1) receptors. MC4 receptors in the brain are involved in regulation of hunger, satiety, and energy expenditure. In patients with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR deficiency associated with insufficient activation of the MC4 receptor, setmelanotide may re-establish MC4 receptor pathway activity to reduce hunger and promote weight loss through decreased caloric intake and increased energy expenditure. Nonclinical evidence shows that MC4 receptors are important for setmelanotide-regulated appetite and weight loss. The MC1 receptor is expressed on melanocytes, and activation of this receptor leads to accumulation of melanin and increased skin pigmentation independently of ultraviolet light <span class="Italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</span>.</p><h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3><p class="First"><span class="Bold">Energy Expenditure</span></p><p>Short-term administration of Imcivree in 12 healthy obese patients increased resting energy expenditure and shifted substrate oxidation to fat.</p><p><span class="Bold">Blood Pressure and Heart Rate</span></p><p>No clinically significant increases in blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) were observed following administration of Imcivree to healthy obese patients or patients with monogenic obesity.</p><h3>Pharmacokinetics</h3><p class="First">The mean steady state setmelanotide C<span class="Sub">max,ss</span>, AUC<span class="Sub">tau</span>, and trough concentration for a 3-mg dose administered subcutaneously once daily was 37.9 ng/mL, 495 h*ng/mL, and 6.77 ng/mL, respectively. Steady-state plasma concentrations of setmelanotide were achieved within 2 days with daily dosing of 1-3 mg setmelanotide. The accumulation of setmelanotide in the systemic circulation during once-daily dosing over 12 weeks was approximately 30%. Setmelanotide AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> increased proportionally following multiple-dose subcutaneous administration in the proposed dose range (1-3 mg).</p><p><span class="Bold">Absorption</span></p><p>After subcutaneous injection of Imcivree, plasma concentrations of setmelanotide reached maximum concentrations at a median t<span class="Sub">max</span> of 8 h after dosing.</p><p><span class="Bold">Distribution</span></p><p>The mean apparent volume of distribution of setmelanotide after subcutaneous administration of Imcivree 3 mg once daily was estimated from the population pharmacokinetics model to be 48.7 L.

Study 1 (NCT02896192) enrolled patients aged 6 years and above with obesity and genetically confirmed or suspected POMC or PCSK1 deficiency, and Study 2 (NCT03287960) enrolled patients aged 6 years and above with obesity and genetically confirmed or suspected LEPR deficiency. In both studies, the local genetic testing results were centrally confirmed using Sanger sequencing. The studies enrolled patients with homozygous or presumed compound heterozygous pathogenic, likely pathogenic variants, or VUS for either the <span class="Italics">POMC</span> or <span class="Italics">PCSK1</span> genes (Study 1) or the <span class="Italics">LEPR</span> gene (Study 2). Patients with double heterozygous variants in 2 different genes were not eligible for treatment with Imcivree.
